for this time of year.

17
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,990
It's unusual.

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,120
Yes, it is.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,560
I hope nothing happens.

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,200
The weather's really bad.

21
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,350
Watch out, guys. Here's the roof.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
We're watching.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
Make sure it's aligned.

24
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,510
Ok.

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Jianguo,

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
catch this.

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,760
Give me.

28
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,000
Be careful with your hands.

29
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,910
Come.

30
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,510
The bottom should be aligned.

31
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,400
I'll push it from the outside.

32
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
Is it ok?

33
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,390
Uncle Hongyu

34
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,700
is working so hard.

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,580

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Get to work.

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,390
- Come on.
- Lazy guy.

40
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,760
Take a break. Have some water.

41
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,200
- Come on.
- Mom.

42
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,390
Take this.

43
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,370
Be careful.

44
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,790
- Mom.
- Take a break.

45
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,550
Let's take turns

46
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,040
and try to build it in one go, ok?

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
- Ok.
- Ok.

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Hongyu, have some water.

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,200
Fang Tao, would you like some water?

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,550
I'll get it.

51
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,800
- I'll drink when I'm done.
- Ok.

52
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,790
Mom.

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
- Mom.
- Mom.

54
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,160
Mom.

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,510
Mom. Go inside and check.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Ok.

57
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,950
Walk around and feel it.

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,390
With Mom's dexterous hands,

59
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,990
our family will be prosperous again.

60
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,920
That's true.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,400
Now we have so many family members.

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,520
It's so lively.

63
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Mom, what do you think?

64
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,990
You know, I really feel different.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,230
I feel like I'm in the palace of heaven.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
Good. Thank you, guys.

67
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,350
Mom is happy with our work.

68
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,960
Mom, when you give the order,

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,190
we will be

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,160
at your beck and call.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
- Ok.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,190
- We are on your call.
- Thanks.

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,480
Thanks, guys.

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,230
Can we fit all these members

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,640
in the house?

76
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,750
One table for adults, one table for kids.

77
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
- Yeah.
- Let's celebrate today.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Get inside and eat.

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,750
- Ok.
- Let's eat.

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,550
Let's eat.

81
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,520
- Come on.
- Have a few drinks.

82
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Let's eat.

83
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,190
- Jiali.
- Ok.

84
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,840
Bring your dad's cup over here.

85
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Okay.

86
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,920
Your dad misses you all in heaven.

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,800
Today,

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,020
we have sons, daughters,

89
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,750
husbands, and wives here.

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,160
It's a joyous and harmonious day.

91
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,230
Finally, our family is complete again.

92
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,350
Since we're a family,

93
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,350
we should act like a family.

94
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,160
From now on, let's be united

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,550
and look out for each other.

96
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,160
Don't let me do all the talking.

97
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,120
You should say something too.

98
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
You're good at talking.

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,310
Home, home.

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
What's home?

101
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,600
What's home?

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,430
You tell us.

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,000
Hongyu.

104
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,070
You tell us.

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
Home?

106
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
Go ahead.

107
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
Say it.

108
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,350
Home is not a restaurant.

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,040
Home is not a hotel.

110
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,600
Home is not a place for business.

111
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,720
Where there's Mom, there's home.

112
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,790
Where there's my wife, there's home.

113
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,550
Jiawen, you guys should say something too.

114
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,150
You say it.

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,160
Home should be tidy and clean.

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,640
- Yeah.
- Jiali, say something.

117
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,030
Home...

118
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Home is

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
peace of mind.

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Home is solidity.

121
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,350
Home is unity.

122
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,110

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,640

I'll drink this on behalf of him,

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
ok?

126
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,520
- Come on.
- Come.

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,040
unite with your sisters and brothers-in-law

131

132
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,550
Mom, it's the Spring Festival.

133
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,960
Don't say anything inauspicious.

134
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,920
Ok, you're right.

135
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,550

But the point is that,

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,070
there aren't many jobs.

and see if there are any opportunities.

167
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,040
There is one.

168
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,070
There's a big pharmaceutical plant

169
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,830
going up nearby.

170
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,880
They're hiring now.

171

Weiguo is pulling strings

172
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,430
to get me a job in there.

173
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,510
That's good.

174
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,280
Yeah, he went to his elder brother.

175
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,240
He has a student

176
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,430
who works at the personnel bureau

177
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,280
or in the development zone.

178
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
He might be able to help.

179
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,510
But...

180
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,280
But he hasn't got back to us yet.

181
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,280
His brother and sister-in-law

182
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,120
are very stingy and petty.

183
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,160

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,270
- Yes.
- I'll make some food.

192
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,120
No, it's too much trouble. I'm leaving.

193
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,880
Not at all. It'll be ready in a minute.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,360
- No, thanks.
- Yes, Jiali.

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
Eat the eggs.

196
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,470
I'll bring you more when you're done.

197
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,550
I've got

198
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,710
the chicken feed for Mom.

199
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,120
(Compound Chicken Feed)
I'll send it to her.

200
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,880
I'll take it home.

201
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
No, it's too heavy for you.

202
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Ok, then.

203
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,580
- I'm leaving.
- Then...

204
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,950
No.

205
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,790
Aunt, bye.

206
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,620
Bye, Guangming.

207
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,610
Take care, Jiali.

208
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,950
Son, play by yourself for a bit.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,040
Liu Xiaoling, are you a dog?

210
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,640
Why are you nervous if you did nothing wrong?

211
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,640
What's wrong with you?

212
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,830
Stop sniffing. Stop.

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,470
This is not the first time, Tang Zhenmin.

214
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,590
It's the same cloying,

215
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,190
stinky woman's perfume from last time.

216
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,000
Smell it yourself.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,190
Isn't this the smell of sweat?

218
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,830
You didn't wash it clean.

219
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,240
If you tell me the truth,

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
I'll let it go.

221
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,190
But if you lie to me and I find out,

222
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,280
I'm not done with you.

223
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,190
I admit I danced,

224
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,000
but I only danced a little.

225
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,190
Didn't you promise me

226
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,880
you'd never dance behind my back again?

227
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,790
With that Wang Aiju again?

228
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,670
Fine.

229
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,160
You live with her. I'll go.

230
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
Liu Xiaoling,

231
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,950
if you run away from home again,

232
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,160
don't expect me to pick you up.

233
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,190
This is my home.

234
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,280
If anyone's leaving, it's you!

235
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,190
Fine, this is your home. I'll go!

236
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,070
Ma'am, the tea is ready.

237
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,880
Try this, first flush of the year.

238
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,360
You'd better calm down.

239
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,880
Why don't you stay at Mom's for a while?

240
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,070
I'm not going.

241
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,400
She'll scold me again.

242
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,040
She always takes his side.

243
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,190
Why don't you

244
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,000
go to see Qiufang?

245
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,960
Definitely not.

246
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,070
Since she married into the Tang family,

247
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,670
she's thought of herself as a family member.

248
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,830
She only helps them.

249
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,950
Maybe it's not as bad as you think.

250
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,640
I don't think Zhenmin is that kind of guy.

251
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,370
Jiayi,

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,190
what I hate the most

253
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,430
is that he's idle all day long.

254
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,000
He doesn't make much money.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's killing me.

256
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,190
Didn't I tell you to let him

257
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,400
quit his job and start a business?

258
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,760
Do you think he will listen?

259
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,280
He doesn't take any advice.

260
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,670
Many people around us

261
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,400
have made their fortunes in business,

262
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,040
like his eldest brother

263
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,710
and your husband.

264
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,520
The government encourages

265
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
some people to get rich first.

266
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,790
If you don't move forward,

267
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,190
how can you get rich first?

268
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,470
So some people don't lose

269
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,240
because of their ability,

270
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,590
but because of their attitude and vision.

271
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,590
You're absolutely right, Jiayi.

272
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,790
Why don't I quit my job?

273
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,030
You quit?

274
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,430
You can't.

275
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,630
Why?

276
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,070
You got Dad's job.

277
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,790
If you quit,

278
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,590
Ouyang wouldn't dare help you.

279
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,670
Dad's job is just a job.

280
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,160
It's not a title.

281
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,590
It's a secure job.

282
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
It has become insecure long ago.

283
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,000
Still, it's different.

284
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,240
You have a family

285
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,400
and a son.

286
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,240
As for business,

287
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,830
keep an eye on it

288
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,280
until there's a good opportunity.

289
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,190
It's safer this way.

290
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,960
Jiaxi.

291
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,270
Jiaxi.

292
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,390
Jiaxi.

293
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
Jiaxi!

294
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,120
Hongyu,

295
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,280
I'm bleeding.

296
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,940
(Labor Ward)

297
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,040
Jiali, how is she?

298
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,280
The patient is fine.

299
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,710
What about my baby?

300
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,480
It didn't survive.

301
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,880
Hongyu,

302
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,520
where is your mom?

303
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,920
Mom, please help us.

304
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,240
I can't.

305
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,710
I have to work.

306
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,310
You know how things are at the Mall.

307
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,310
We each have our own task.

308
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,670
I can't be absent.

309
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,270
Besides,

310
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,830
doesn't she just lie in bed and rest?

311
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,070
Do I have to stay with her?

312
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,310
Mom, you...

313
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Are you my mom?

314
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,470
I'm your mom,

315
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,830
not hers.

316
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm telling you,

317
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
I'm not done with you yet.

318
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,640
How did you lose my grandson?

319
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,280
Do you know it's murder?

320
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,430
And you ask me to take care of her.

321
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,550
What are you thinking?

322
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,760
Jiaxi,

323
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,960
where are you going?

324
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,740
- What are you doing?
- Let go.

325
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,120
Jiaxi.

326
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,200
Jiaxi.

327
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,880
You miss your daughter every day.

328
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,830
Now, look,

329
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,240
she came back right after she left.

330
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,310
I must take good care of you,

331
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,710
or you'll have health issues.

332
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,150
We shouldn't

333
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,310
have got married.

334
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

335
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Hongyu.

336
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,760
Jiali.

337
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,630
Jiaxi will stay here for a few days.

338
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,920
You may have to

339
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,710
come and see her every day.

340
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,920
I know.

341
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
One more thing,

342
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,470
she is your wife.

343
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,270
You'll be living on your own.

344
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,670
You should have your own opinion.

345
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,470
Let's forget about the house.

346
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,270
But I still think it's better

347
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,080
for you and Jiaxi to move out

348
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
and live alone.

349
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,430
If you don't have a house, rent one.

350
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,160
I see.

351
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,470
So, I'm leaving.

352
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,550
Jiali,

353
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,560
I have something to tell you.

354
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,880
What is it?

355
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,710
Nothing.

356
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,160
Don't make trouble, I'm telling you.

357
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,670
So, did you tell her?

358
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,350
No.

359
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,670
I don't think she'll agree.

360
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,670
You'd better not tell her.

361
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,320
You can do both work and business

362
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,990
until you achieve something.

363
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,030
That's the best I can do.

364
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,920
Mom is the best.

365
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,430
Of course.

366
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,950
But I can't take care of you forever.

367
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,270
I don't even want to go home.

368
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,920
You have to go back to your own home.

369
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,230
Hurry up. Hongyu's here.

370
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,120
Put your shoes on.

371
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
Mom.

372
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,750
You're here.

373
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,510
I've got some food for you.

374
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,670
Don't give me any more melon seeds.

375
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,670
We have plenty of them.

376
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,030
I know you like them.

377
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,270
Go home.

378
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,880
Are you better?

379
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,670
I have taken good care of her.

380
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,270
Thanks for your hard work, Mom.

381
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,430
Go back and live your life.

382
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,920
My luggage is in the room.

383
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,270
Ok, I'll get it.

384
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,670
Mom.

385
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,840
Take this with you later.

386
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,230
How old are you?

387
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,950
Enough.

388
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,120
- Chicken.
- Seven bamboos.

389
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,920
Wang, your daughter-in-law is back.

390
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
- Whose turn is it?
- Draw the tiles.

391
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,310
Three characters.

392
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,470
- Mom.
- North Wind.

393
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,470
Hello, are you playing?

394
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,840
- You're home.
- Mom.

395
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,110
You're home?

396
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,920
Go upstairs and have a rest.

397
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,110
Go ahead.

398
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,430
Seven bamboos.

399
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,880
Eight bamboos.

400
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,600
Draw the tiles, hurry.

401
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,440
Two characters.

402
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,830
Five bamboos.

403
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,230
East Wind.

404
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,880
Ok, Green Dragon.

405
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
Jiaxi.

406
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,270
It took you so long in there.

407
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,270
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

408
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
Jiaxi.

409
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,590
Well,

410
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,560
did you use so much toilet paper?

411
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,560
You don't have to

412
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,030
clean a small ass so much.

413
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,560
Save toilet paper, ok?

414
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,880
- Mom, I...
- I'm telling you,

415
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,670
you can spend money, but you can't waste it.

416
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
You can be rich if you save every penny.

417
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,980
Here's the mop.

418
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,190
Mop the floor if you have nothing to do.

419
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,880
Look how dirty it is.

420
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,270
Don't you see it?

421
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,030
When I come out, wash the mop first.

422
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,870
Don't just use the dry mop.

423
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,320
Did you save Hongyu some food?

424
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,160
I forgot.

425
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,080
I'll bring a plate and save some.

426
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,880
Forget it.

427
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,430
Don't save him leftovers.

428
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,080
I'll cook for him later.

429
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,070
Eat.

430
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,510
Jiaxi,

431
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,030
don't eat so fast

432
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,670
or it's hard to digest.

433
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,270
Besides, no one is competing with you.

434
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
Eat slowly.

435
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,710
Don't smack your lips.

436
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,110
It doesn't look good.

437
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,750
Also,

438
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,840
don't talk while eating or sleeping.

439
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,320
Mom, I didn't talk.

440
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm just

441
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,470
telling you the rules in advance.

442
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,510
Eat.

443
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,640
Got caught in the rain?

444
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,840
It's raining. Here.

445
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
It wasn't a good day, huh?

446
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah, there are many taxi drivers now.

447
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,360
I'm thinking

448
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,160
I'd better go to my mom's.

449
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,590
No.

450
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,110
What's wrong?

451
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,880
Oh, my, your mom

452
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
has more rules than a queen mother.

453
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,270
Just ignore her.

454
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,710
You live on different floors.

455
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,710
You only see each other when you eat.

456
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,510
Eating alone,

457
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,710
no, and going to the bathroom

458
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,510
are driving me crazy already.

459
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,820
Does she pick on you going to the bathroom?

460
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,880
Anyway, Yan Hongyu, I'm telling you,

461
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,750
this place is just a transition.

462
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,790
I see.

463
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,790
I see.

464
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,030
I have something to tell you.

465
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,880
We may have changes at the company.

466
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,880
What do you mean?

467
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,560
Our company has been restructured.

468
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,360
Now we have to be self-financing.

469
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,120
Only three of us can stay in the department.

470
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,880
The rest are either transferred or retired.

471
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,080
Are you staying?

472
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,160
I'm staying,

473
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,160
but the company won't pay us anymore.

474
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,270
Won't pay you?

475
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,270
We have to find our own way to make money.

476
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,470
I need to talk to you

477
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,160
about something.

478
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,840
Lv said

479
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,030
there are some big feed mills in Sichuan.

480
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,190
I've been thinking

481
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,840
about working together with them.

482
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,220
Here's what I think.

483
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,270
We produce similar products.

484
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,320
We have the building and equipment.

485
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,950
I can make some money

486
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,510
as their OEM.

487
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,510
Are you going to Sichuan?

488
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,750
That's why I'm talking to you.

489
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,560
How often will you come back?

490
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,990
It's hard to say.

491
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,880
I'll see if we can make a deal.

492
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,230
If it goes well.

493
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,800
I'll probably have to come back and forth.

494
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,270
Ok.

495
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,310
Go ahead.

496
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,120
We have no other choice.

497
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,510
What about the pharmaceutical plant?

498
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,270
They haven't replied yet.

499
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,760
Let's wait a bit.

500
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,510
Mom, I'm a big boy now.

501
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,670
Don't do it anymore.

502
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,030
They started it.

503
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,970
I fought back in self-defense.

504
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,640
You broke his head.

505
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,480
Beating, again?

506
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,640
Dad, I fought back in self-defense.

507
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,320
Mom accused me of initiating the attack.

508
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,190
- Seriously?
- I had to play passive defense.

509
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,560
It's no use just beating him.

510
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,400
Exactly.

511
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,600
Your son

512
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,360
broke someone's head again.

513
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,750
You may end up in a labor camp.

514
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,400
Fine.

515
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,800
Save your energy.

516
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,400
I'll do it for you.

517
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
Tell me where to hit him.

518
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,430
Enough. Get to your room.

519
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,950
Look at you, being reluctant again.

520
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,950
You can't use your belt.

521
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,990
This is enough.

522
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,230
He's only afraid of my belt.

523
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,360
Write an apology.

524
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,360
Have some more.

525
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,120
You only ate three.

526
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,160
You'll be hungry at night.

527
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,360
Don't worry about it.

528
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,840
I think we should

529
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,510
let him sign up for this year's draft

530
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,920
and let the army train him.

531
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,430
He has never left home.

532
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,120
You chicken out whenever we talk about this.

533
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,640
Our son has grown up.

534
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,830
We can't discipline him anymore.

535
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,320
Let's hand him over to the army.

536
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
He may get better after he retires.

537
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,920
Didn't you just say

538
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,750
he may end up in a labor camp?

539
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,560
Besides, after he retires,

540
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,560
he will be assigned a job.

541
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,950
Many people compete to join the army.

542
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,350
Where is he going?

543
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,400
Wherever he is assigned.

544
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,120
He is my only son.

545
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,950
Boys need to suffer.

546
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,920
Didn't we suffer before?

547
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,400
It's good to suffer when you're young.

548
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
I'm suffering in my old age.

549
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,510
Why are you suffering?

550
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,600
My workplace is a pilot

551
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,030
for institutional reform.

552
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,160
I may get transferred or laid off.

594

shall we call it a day

595
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,080
and go home?

596
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,760
Jiahuan is busy.

597
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,640
Xiaoling isn't here, either.

598
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Not everyone's here. Let's just skip it.

599
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,310
Ok.

600
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,880
How did it go with your job?

601
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,430
Weiguo's sister is trying to

602
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,510
get me into the pharmaceutical plant.

603
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,720
Ok.

People can't avoid

605
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,160
getting sick,

606
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,320
and when they do, they need medicine.

607
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,920
It's just a collective enterprise,

608
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,510
not a secure job.

609
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,120
These days,

610
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,990

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,880

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,990
coal mines, and power plants,

614
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,890
there's no such thing as a secure job.

615
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,120
Yes. I kind of envy Jiayi.

616
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,400
She had gone through hard work for years

617
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,510
before she succeeded accidentally.

618
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,320
Don't envy her.

619
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,110
Not everyone can do business.

620
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,580
Yeah. Anyway, we have to

621
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,060
make our own living

622
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
and show our own prowess.

623
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,580
Jiali.

624
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,580
Come on.

625
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,660
It's so nice.

Behave when you get there.

630

Don't make trouble.

631
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,020
Yes.

632
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,140
He won't.

633
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,380
He won't.

634
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,420
Xiaonian,

635
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,340
behave when you are in the army.

636
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,180
Yes.

637
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,180
Don't make trouble.

638
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,220
Xiaonian, take this.

639
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,740
No, no.

640
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,580
Mom, no need.

641
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,740
He'll get an allowance there.

642
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,620
Take it.

643
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,180
It won't cost him anything there.

644
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,940
Thank Grandma.

645
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,820
Thank you, Grandma.

646
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
Don't spend it recklessly.

647
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,330
I know.

648
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,180
Write to us.

649
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,980
Don't worry.

650
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,380
He's stationed in the province.

651
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,990
- Just try not to make trouble.
- It's close.

652
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
I'm so happy.

653
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,970
All assemble!

654
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,540
Go ahead.

655
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,220
I'll wait a little longer.

656
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,220
Who are you waiting for?

657
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,290
Xiaofang said she would see me off.

658
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,580
Which Xiaofang?

659
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,740
Tang Xiaofang.

660
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,860

Hurry up.

663
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,800
Get in line!

664
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,820
They radiate energy.

665
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,500
It's

666
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,620
like a dream.

667
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,340
This is the same truck I rode in

668
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,700
when I went to the countryside.

669
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,220
It's ok.

670
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,380
He's never left home yet.

671
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,020
Don't worry.

672
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,900
Everyone,

673
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,820
attention!

674
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,020
Right face!

675
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,060
Face forward!

676
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,330
At ease!

677
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,500
Attention!

678
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,260
(Honor)

679
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,530
I should have claimed your tile just now,

680
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,660
then I would win.

681
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,340
You've got a good hand of tiles.

682
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,240
Yes.

683
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,820
What a good hand.

684
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,140
Jianguo, you're back.

685
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,340
Let's finish this game and call it a day.

686
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,220
No, I haven't made my money back.

687
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,300
Then we'll play with you for a while.

688
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,540
Two more games.

689
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,540
It's ok.

690
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,060
Come on.

691
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
One less.

692
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,740
Ok, that's enough for today.

693
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,780
We'll play again some other time.

694
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,940
It's ok.

695
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,100
We have plenty of time.

696
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,660
I'm sure you'll get your money back.

697
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,940
Jianguo, we're leaving.

698
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,500
Some other time.

699
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,660
Jiali, let's play some other time.

700
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,580
What's wrong?

701
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
Do you have a problem with me?

702
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,740
No.

703
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,060
Yes, you do.

704
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,660
It was just for fun.

705
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,660
What's with the long face?

706
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,300
Was it just for fun?

707
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,460
You were gambling.

708
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,340
Only ten cents a game.

709
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,460
I was just passing the time.

710
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,660
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

711
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,980
Jiali,

712
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,460
I understand you're in a bad mood

713
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,340
after you were laid off.

714
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,060
And our son is in the army.

715
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,620
You have a hard time getting over it.

716
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,060
That's why I gave you time.

717
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,860
But you can't do this always.

718
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,140
You play mahjong every day.

719
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,700
You're almost fixed on the table.

720
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,460
If I don't play, what can I do?

721
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,420
Anything

722
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,620
is better than playing mahjong.

723
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,740
I've worked with vegetables half my life.

724
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,900
I don't know what else to do.

725
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,660
You can still work with vegetables.

726
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,900
People have to work.

727
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,140
Staying idle at home every day,

728
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,860
forget making money,

729
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,100
you will fall apart mentally.

730
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,550
My world has fallen apart long ago.

731
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,300
Jiali,

732
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,940
as long as you pull yourself together,

733
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,260
whatever you do, I'll support you.

734
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,660
You can make it.

735
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,900
Now that you've been laid off,

736
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,300
change your track.

737
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,260
You'll still have a great life.

738
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,900
You have a secure life.

739
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,140
You don't understand.

740
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,460
Even if I don't,

741
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,740
could it be harder than the past,

742
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,760
than when we got married?

743
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,740
It's much harder!

744
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,940
It was hard then.

745
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,260
But we were still young at that time.

746
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,780
You're not old now.

747
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,260
You're lying to yourself and me.

748
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,780
I'm not a child.

749
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,540
Jiali,

750
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,260
once you start to work,

751
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,700
everything will be different.

752
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,780
How do I start?

753
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,980
I only know how to sell vegetables.

754
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,140
No problem.

755
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,180
That's it. I'll support you.

756
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,060
You're a cadre.

757
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,180
If your wife runs a stall in the market,

758
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,660
wouldn't it make you ashamed?

759
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,540
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

760
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,660
Even if you're not ashamed, I am.

761
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,980
My life is getting worse.

762
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,580
You're not thinking straight.

763
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,420
Don't you think you've regressed

764
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,700
in your consciousness?

765
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,300
All honest labor holds equal dignity.

766
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,100
Every legitimate job well done

767
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,260
writes its own medal of honor.

768
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
This isn't the old days.

769
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,580
It was honorable to be a waste collector.

770
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,980
I did it before.

771
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,980
Whoever earns money is honorable now.

772
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,540
As long as you can demonstrate your value,

773
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,380
you are honorable.

774
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,100
We don't have any start-up money.

775
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,540
We spent all our savings

776
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,860
to buy out this house.

777
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,740
Then we'll borrow.

778
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,500
I'll ask my colleagues.

779
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
I'll figure it out.

780
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Sir, Ma'am,

781
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
your sister is here.

782
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,340
Got it.

783
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,740
Coming.

784
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,800
Ms. Liao,

785
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,700
make my sister some Biluochun Tea.

786
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,540
- Ouyang.
- Yes.

787
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
Jiali.

788
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,860
Did I interrupt your rest?

789
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,740
It's ok.

790
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,820
Jiali,

791
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,460
what's up?

792
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
I have a favor to ask of you.

793
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,580
Take a seat.

794
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,610
Sit down first.

795
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,180
What is it, Jiali?

796
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,580
No, thanks.

797
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,300
It's been a while since I was laid off.

798
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,660
I can't stay idle forever.

799
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,780
I'm thinking of starting a small business.

800
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,700
What kind of business?

801
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,060
I haven't made up my mind.

802
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,100
The same old business, probably.

803
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,860
Why don't you work for Ouyang?

804
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,540
He's got a job opening.

805
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,540
If you want to join us, no problem.

806
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,100
He's business is big.

807
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,980
I don't know how to do it.

808
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,940
I'm flattered.

809
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,180
Besides, he has many brothers

810
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,260
who can help him.

811
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,540
He doesn't need a woman like me.

812
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,060
I don't want to cause trouble.

813
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,900
It's ok, Jiali.

814
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,060
If you want to join us,

815
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,700
I'll give you an easy job.

816
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,540
No, no.

817
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,500
I don't think so.

818
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,300
It's not good that I depend on you

819
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,100
for a living.

820
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
What do you think, then?

821
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,100
My savings are due at the end of this month.

822
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,780
I want to borrow some from you first.

823
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,980
I'll pay you back at the end of the month.

824
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,820
How much do you need?

825
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,740
3,000.

826
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,900
I'll get it.

827
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,580
Thanks, Jiayi.

828
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,300
Have some tea, please.

829
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,060
Jiali, count it.

830
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,140
No need. You do a big business.

831
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,860
You're more careful with it than we do.

832
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,020
Ms. Liao,

833
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,940
get me a pen and paper.

834
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
Why do you need it?

835
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,100
Ma'am.

836
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,500
Here, Jiali.

837
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
Write me an IOU.

838
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,350
Jiali,

839
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,900
you don't have to.

840
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,980
We don't need an IOU.

841
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,480
I'll write one.

842
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,260
- No.
- I'm glad Jiayi reminded me.

843
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,580
Yes, it's good to write one.

844
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,500
We'll make it clear.

845
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,380
Why do you have to do this?

846
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,300
- Tear it up.
- No.

847
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,540
Even brothers keep clear accounts.

848
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,060
You lent me money out of goodwill.

849
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,260
I wrote this as a matter of responsibility.

850
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,100
It's the right thing to do on both counts.

851
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,860
We don't have to be so formal.

852
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,900
Ok, I'm leaving.

853
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
I won't bother you anymore.

854
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,900
Bye, Ouyang.

855
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,380
Jiali, I'm not walking you out.

856
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,420
What's wrong with you?

857
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,580
Why did you make her do that?

858
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,300
What's wrong with writing an IOU?

859
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,500
It's the right thing to do.

860
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,340
I didn't ask her to pay any interest.

861
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,900
We're family.

862
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,460
Why do you have to do this?

863
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,740
What do you know?

864
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,900
I never wanted her to pay me back.
