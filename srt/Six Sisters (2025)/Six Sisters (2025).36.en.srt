Has the house been transferred to you?

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
Jiaxi.

18
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,960
Tell everyone what's going on

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,390
with this house.

20
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,860
Same as before.

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,960
Whoever takes Mom's house

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
has to take care of her.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We agreed on this; it's only right.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,030
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,360
You're just spitting nonsense, you know?

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,910
Mom, say something.

27
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,520
What's going on with this house?

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,150
Has it been transferred to Jiaxi,

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,650
or are we each getting a share later?

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,990
I'm not dead yet,

31
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,430
and you're thinking about my house.

32
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,830
If you ask me,

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,830
I'll give it to whoever I want to.

34
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,800
What's the problem?

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
Let's go.

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,110
Don't go; we haven't worked this out.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,320
Your son owes me 20,000.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,550
- Pay me back.
- Jiaxi.

41
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,920
Don't push it.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,550
Didn't we settle this last time?

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,320
Whoever owes money is responsible.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Your son

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,800
is a jerk.

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,640
He Jiaxi, are you crazy?

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,550
He Xiangdong is a jerk.

what's going on?

52
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,230

will make a toast.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
Thank you.

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,040
Thank you. Cheers.

60
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,760
- Sit.
- Eat more.

61
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,830
Eat more, and drink more.

62
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,910
Let's toast them there.

63
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,830
OK, let's go.

64
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Jiayi, Jiahuan, eat more.

65
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,350
- Drink less.
- You guys go.

66
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,190
Mr. He,

67
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,790
come to toast in a bit.

68
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,590
You can't fake it, okay?

69
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,910
It has to be real alcohol.

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,320
Jiayi and Jiahuan are looking at us.

71
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,760
They won't even look us in the eye.

72
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,830
They're guilty.

73
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,230
Probably.

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,790
Jiali and Jiawen are over there.

75
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,090
How about a drink with them?

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,710
No need for that.

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,710
Jiali thinks

78
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,230
we've sided with Jiaxi.

79
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,320
What's this called?

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,640
We annoyed everyone
without anything in return.

81
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,320
Anyway, she doesn't seem

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
happy.

83
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,230
Jiali,

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,760
do you think Jiayi and Jiahuan

85
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,830
have gotten something in return?

86
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,590
Why would they help Jiaxi that day then?

87
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,230
Especially Jiayi.

88
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,960
"I don't want that house."

89
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,760
Is she someone who doesn't want it?

90
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,120
We were a good family.

91
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,710
Look what it's come to.

92
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,150
I don't think Mom and Jiaxi are here.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,320
Jiali, Jiawen,

94
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,560
I toast to you both.

95
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,520
Alright, stop.

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
Hongyu.

97
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,430
Hongyu.

98
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,200
You're a good man.

99
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,320
Jiaxi doesn't get it,

100
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,830
but you have to be sensible.

101
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,480
Yes.

102
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,630
Jiali,

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,560
Jiaxi can be rash sometimes.

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,350
Don't mind her.

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,790
Xiaoman, have an ice pop.

106
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,630
Hi, Dad.

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,120
What's wrong with your mom?

108
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,230
I don't know.

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
Here, take this.

110
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
Sure.

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,200
What happened? Who upset you?

112
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,000
Eat an ice cream.

113
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,320
Who handed out these red eggs?

114
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,710
Your Aunt Xiaoling's daughter
turned 100 days old, right?

115
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,560
Don't mention her.
Can she even have a son?

116
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,680
Her son's been working for years, right?

117
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,000
Yan Hongyu,

118
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,120
be ambitious, okay?

119
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,200
Look at He Qiqing. How capable he is.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,270
Liu Xiaoling is living
in a high-rise now.

121
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,420
Look at me.

122
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,560
This old house is cold in winter
and hot in summer.

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,060
Even the lights aren't bright enough.

124
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,320
Dad, do you get what Mom means?

125
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,600
She wants to live in a high-rise.

126
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,620
(Premium houses are getting fewer;
Stock is running out)

127
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,080
What? No. 1 Longhu Road
is going up again?

128
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,710
It's a good location.

129
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,990
It has commercial properties
and is in a school district.

130
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,470
Rich clients can't even buy it.

131
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,510
They have to fight for it.

132
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,790
The houses are sold at once.

133
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,030
You have to be quick.

134
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,440
I think you're asking too much.

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,320
It's a second-hand house.
Is it that good?

136
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
There are new houses.

137
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,680
They're new existing flats of this year.

138
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,230
It's cheaper

139
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,470
than a second-hand one.

140
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,600
But

141
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,680
you have to decorate it yourself.

142
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,030
If you're not afraid of the hassle,
that works too.

143
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,080
But you can't move in at once.

144
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,200
Here, this is all of it.

145
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,230
It's all here.

146
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,680
Let me make it clear.

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,510
I didn't keep any money.

148
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,230
Everything's gone to the family.

149
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,230
It sounds as if I've kept some money.

150
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,230
If you have it, just take it out.

151
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,440
I won't say anything about it.

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,680
How about selling this?

153
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,920
Do you have any?

154
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Really don't.

155
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
Maybe you should wait.

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,220
Let me ask you. What should I wait for?

157
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,130
What should I wait for?

158
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,430
It's perfect to buy it now.

159
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,370
This is a hot property.

160
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,530
If I wait, prices will rise,

161
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,810
and it'll be harder to buy one.

162
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,830
Are you going to live
in this old house forever?

163
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,630
If it were up to me,

164
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,440
we should live within our means.

165
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,280
I heard...

166
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
I heard

167
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,930
that living on higher floors
isn't that good.

168
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,110
How should I put it?

169
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,870
It isn't down to earth.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,590
It makes your legs swell.

171
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,830
Xiaoling is living comfortably.

172
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,630
Yan Hongyu,

173
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,830
I've realized

174
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,870
that people like you
always pull back when pushed,

175
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,680
never making progress.

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
Go ask your mom

177
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,430
for a loan.

178
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,470
Do it for me.

179
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,230
A man's gotta do what he's gotta do.

180
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,920
Please.

181
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,040
I don't think Mom will agree.

182
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,630
Here's the plan.

183
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,040
You've got a good place

184
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,560
with your mother-in-law.

185
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,920
You've got the house.

186
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,960
Why do you have to buy a new one?

187
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,350
If you want to buy one,

188
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,040
sell that old house,

189
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,230
and you'll have the money.

190
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,040
Mom, the house is being demolished.

191
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,830
If we sell it now,
we'll lose a lot of money.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,110
Then just wait.

193
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,080
Anyway, once the demolition's done,

194
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
you'll be living in a new house.

195
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,920
But Jiaxi won't wait.

196
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,110
What do you mean?

197
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,240
Jiaxi...

198
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,070
She's sick.

199
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,260
What kind of sickness?

200
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
A mental illness?

201
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,710
No.

202
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
Something's wrong with her lungs.

203
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,920
It's been years.

204
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,200
I didn't want to worry you,

205
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,630
so I never said anything.

206
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,190
So,

207
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,160
what's the situation now?

208
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,200
It's not optimistic.

209
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,160
Really?

210
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,750
You can't joke about this.

211
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,960
It's true, Mom.

212
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,950
I just...

213
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,200
I just want to stay
with Jiaxi till the end.

214
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,440
I had no choice,

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,630
so I came to ask you.

216
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,750
Alright, stop crying.

217
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,550
I...

218
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
How much do you need?

219
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
80,000.

220
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,750
Then write an IOU.

221
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,990
Of course.

222
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,560
The color of this sweater is nice.

223
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,710
It's for Xiaoling's daughter, right?

224
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,070
Yes.

225
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,560
I didn't visit her when she gave birth,

226
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,750
so I'm knitting her a sweater.

227
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,350
You're her mom.

228
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,350
You shouldn't visit them.

229
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,760
They should be coming to visit you.

230
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,200
You're blocking the door like a doorman.

231
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,680
Who would dare come?

232
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,670
Mom,

233
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,920
what's a doorman for?

234
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,750
It's to block evil spirits.

235
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,320
If they weren't guilty,

236
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,630
they'd come as usual.

237
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,960
Mom, have a walnut.

238
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,750
I want to discuss something with you.

239
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,260
If it's good news, go ahead.

240
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
If it's bad news,

241
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,710
don't even open your mouth.

242
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,350
It's definitely good news.

243
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,830
Here's the thing.

244
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,990
Near Longhu Park,

245
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,060
there's a new development.

246
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,320
It's great,

247
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,110
but the price changes every day.

248
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,200
So, Hongyu and I thought

249
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,400
that while the price
hasn't gone up too much,

250
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,350
we should seize the chance and buy one.

251
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,990
Do you need me to pitch in?

252
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,160
Mom, what good news is this then?

253
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,110
I just wanted to tell you

254
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,350
that I won't borrow money from you.

255
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,200
You should keep that
for your retirement.

256
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,750
Then where's your money?

257
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,710
You don't have money.

258
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,040
My mother-in-law spent a lot.

259
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,320
Is it a gift or a loan?

260
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,960
It's a loan.

261
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,630
Wang Huaimin's buying her son a house,

262
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,510
and that's a loan?

263
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,960
If that's the case,

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,350
why are you two
rushing to buy a house?

265
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,320
Wait until you have the money.

266
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,960
Besides, isn't Xiaoman
going to school here?

267
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,590
The house there isn't

268
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,320
in the same school district, right?

269
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,560
Mom, I'm just buying it.

270
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,920
I'm not in a rush to move in.

271
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,990
It's more of an investment,

272
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,830
you know?

273
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,510
Besides, I feel uneasy without a house.

274
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,630
I know you.

275
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,960
Seeing Xiaoling live so comfortably

276
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,110
makes you

277
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,830
feel unhappy, right?

278
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,990
You know me the best.

279
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,560
Yes, Mom.

280
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
Do you think I can be happy?

281
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,230
How can I be happy?

282
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,190
What's so different about me
and Xiaoling?

283
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,110
People aim higher.

284
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,320
Why can she make it?

285
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,590
I can make it too.

286
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,750
Jiaxi,

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,920
can you stop comparing yourself
to others?

288
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,960
You're always better than someone,

289
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,870
right?

290
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,200
You need to be content like me.

291
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,040
You're moving out already?

292
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,990
Mom, don't think like that.

293
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,750
This place will always be my base.

294
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,350
Even if I buy a house,

295
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,800
I'll still split time between both.

296
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,830
I'll make sure to take good care of you.

297
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,240
Don't worry.

298
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
I don't need anyone.

299
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,440
I can take care of myself.

300
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
I don't count on any of you.

301
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,400
Don't say things you don't mean.

302
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,560
It's the truth.

303
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,800
Overthinking harms your spleen.
Eat this.

304
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,400
Ma'am, I want a jar of pickles.

305
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Here.

306
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
Yan Hongyu.

307
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,830
I'm telling you.

308
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,230
Living on a high floor like this

309
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,800
is what it means to live with dignity.

310
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,470
Isn't this a bit too high?

311
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,230
Not at all.

312
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,680
It's a high floor after all.

313
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,200
Liu Xiaoling lives on the 17th,

314
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,230
so I'm living on the 18th.

315
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,110
One floor higher.

316
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,710
To make money for this house,

317
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,510
we even told Mom you were sick.

318
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,040
Isn't that cursing yourself?

319
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,320
You're really funny.

320
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,470
If I didn't say that,

321
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,590
could Mom lend us the money?

322
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,920
Just don't worry about it.

323
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,080
Let's hurry and decorate the place.

324
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,400
We should ask He Qiqing about it.

325
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Why?

326
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,710
Is he the only decorator?

327
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,200
Plenty of people outside
are waiting for work.

328
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,320
They're cheap and fast.

329
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,920
We can just pick anyone.

330
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,800
Maybe we'll be able

331
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,990
to move into the house
before the year ends.

332
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,110
By the way,

333
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,120
weren't we supposed to go
to my mom's for lunch?

334
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,400
What about your mom?

335
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,120
My mom?

336
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
Right.

337
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,880
Let's take her with us.

338
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,840
Aren't you afraid of being found out?

339
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,640
Your mom doesn't know you're sick.

340
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,520
Well,

341
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,240
how about

342
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,440
we leave my mom at home?

343
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,370
The 15th of August
isn't a major holiday anyway.

344
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,420
I'll tell her.

345
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,030
How nice.

346
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,230
This room will be Xiaoman's.

347
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,790
It's so spacious.

348
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,230
Mom, I've prepared mooncakes for you.

349
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,470
Make sure to eat them.

350
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,920
We'll be back after lunch.

351
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,250
Grandma, have some tea.

352
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,480
Mom?

353
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,840
You guys go ahead.

354
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,350
Are you mad?

355
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm not a three-year-old.

356
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,880
Why would I be mad?

357
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,030
Just leave.

358
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I'll arrange things for myself.

359
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,840
Mom, I'm not going
to your mother-in-law's.

360
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,910
I'll keep Grandma company.

361
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,640
What are you saying?

362
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,840
How can you say that?

363
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,990
That's your grandmother.

364
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,600
She never liked you to begin with.

365
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,070
If you don't spend time with her,

366
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,070
will she give you money?

367
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,120
You only care about money.

368
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,920
You...

369
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,030
Alright.

370
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,040
Just go.

371
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,640
Xiaoman, go with your mom.

372
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,830
Let's go.

373
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
Take the mooncakes to your grandma.

374
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,510
We're leaving now.

375
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,580
Call me if you need me.

376
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,070
You're finally back.

377
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,960
I missed you so much.

378
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,440
I've got fresh osmanthus.

379
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,400
I'll brew some tea for you right away.

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
Sit down.

381
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,470
When did you come back?

382
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,070
I don't even know.

383
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,310
You didn't even tell me.

384
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,640
I missed you so much.

385
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,070
Is it good?

386
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,960
Yes, it's good.

387
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,640
How's Shanghai?

388
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,710
Were you doing well?

389
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,550
Pretty good.

390
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
What's this?

391
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,790
You brought me goodies again?

392
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,270
Where's Meixin?

393
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,030
Aren't I Meixin?

394
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,840
You're not Meixin.

395
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,470
This is something I got for Meixin.

396
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
What are you doing?

397
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,200
- Ms. Liu.
- Don't follow me.

398
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,040
Don't follow me.

399
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,280
- Mom.
- Don't come here.

400
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,120
- Mom.
- She's robbing me.

401
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,960
Mom, it's fine.

402
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,790
Qiufang, what's going on?

403
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,990
She's robbing me.

404
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,600
This is for Meixin.

405
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,640
I understand. It's fine, Mom.

406
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,830
Meixin,

407
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,680
my mom has Alzheimer's.

408
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,680
Dementia.

409
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,480
It's okay.

410
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
How long has it been?

411
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,880
It's been a while.

412
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,790
She couldn't stay in Shanghai

413
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,880
and insisted on coming back.

414
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,120
At least she can sleep well here.

415
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,680
This is for Meixin.

416
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,440
It's a gift to Meixin.

417
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,990
- A gift to Meixin.
- I know.

418
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,830
I know.

419
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,510
Well...

420
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,710
Can it be cured?

421
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
It's irreversible.

422
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,200
This is for Meixin, not anyone else.

423
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,040
Ms. Liu.

424
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,300
- Ms. Liu
- Mom.

425
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,640
I hate you. You're bad.

426
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,880
How could this happen?

427
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,840
How could such a good person
end up like this?

428
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
Aunt Meixin, I'll talk to you later.

429
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,160
Be careful
when loading these onto the car.

430
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,000
They are fragile.

431
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,040
Okay.

432
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
Wait a minute.

433
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Wait.

434
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,790
Let's leave it here.

435
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Mom needs it.

436
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,360
There's a wicker chair,

437
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,400
a single sofa,

438
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,550
and an old sofa.

439
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,360
Mom has lots of seats.

440
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,710
You guys move it.

441
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,800
Alright.

442
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,680
Slow down.

443
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,510
Don't scrape the leather
against the door.

444
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,000
- OK.
- Slow down.

445
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,310
Follow along, and take a look.

446
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
Slow down.

447
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,230
Mom, I've left the key

448
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,270
to the new house for you.

449
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,200
It's right here.

450
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,230
I've written down

451
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,440
the address for you.

452
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,550
It's Room 4, 18th floor,
Building 4, Yuannan Community.

453
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,120
(Room 4, 18th floor, Building 4)

454
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,400
You can come over anytime.

455
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,750
It's just a ten-minute walk.

456
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,840
I have to leave now.

457
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
The car is waiting for me.

458
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
Jiaxi.

459
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
What's wrong, Mom?

460
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,730
Nothing.

461
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,710
I'm leaving now.

462
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,900
Call me if you need me.

463
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,790
Don't rush to move in.

464
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,960
Let it air out for a while.

465
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,590
Jiaxi.

466
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,510
Jiahuan.

467
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,600
Where did you get this food from?

468
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,740
Aren't you cooking at home anymore?

469
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,360
There's food here anyway, right?

470
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,640
Come on, sit down.

471
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,990
Have you really moved in?

472
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,880
Not completely.

473
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,500
I'm splitting time between both places.

474
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,230
What's the matter, Jiahuan?

475
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,100
Came all the way here to blame me?

476
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,400
Alright, I won't argue with you.

477
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,770
Let's talk about something serious.

478
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,440
What is it?

479
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
Tell me only the good news.

480
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,790
I don't want bad news.

481
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,720
I can't take it.

482
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,790
The year is almost over.

483
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,540
How are we celebrating
the Chinese New Year?

484
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,790
We can't always be so distant.

485
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,760
Jiahuan.

486
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,680
What else can we do?

487
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,760
Jiaxi.

488
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,030
Don't be too extreme about things.

489
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,310
After all, we are sisters.

490
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,960
What?

491
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,440
Are you planning
on never getting along with Jiali?

492
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,310
Jiahuan.

493
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,680
I didn't do anything extreme this time.

494
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,070
Just tell me.

495
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,270
After Jiali moved out,

496
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,550
has she come back to see Mom?

497
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,310
Jiawen visits Mom at festivals,

498
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,880
gives her some money, and then leaves.

499
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,120
What does that mean?

500
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,640
After I moved into this house,

501
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,510
has Mom become only my mom?

502
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
Yes, I know.

503
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,400
They're unhappy

504
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,030
because I bought a house.

505
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,030
What's going on?

506
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,030
Did I spend their money?

507
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,230
The money is from my mother-in-law,

508
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,990
Hongyu, and me.

509
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,440
So, Jiahuan,

510
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,470
I think you should stop doing things
that are thankless.

511
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,970
It's almost the New Year.

512
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,270
If you and Jiayi are filial,
come and see Mom.

513
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,720
As for everyone else,

514
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,500
let them do what they want to.

515
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
I won't force it.

516
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,150
Alright.

517
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,640
You won't listen to me.

518
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,640
You're just impossible to deal with.

519
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,430
Stir things up if you want.

520
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,990
I'll see what you can do to this family.

521
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,020
Jiahuan.

522
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,640
I don't like what you're saying.

523
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,440
I promised you before.

524
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,610
When the house is demolished,
I'll give you a share.

525
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,470
You accepted that.

526
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,310
Now, what's the situation?

527
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,880
Are you siding with the other side?

528
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,750
I know.
You're asking Jiali for help, right?

529
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,470
Is Zhicheng joining the army?

530
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,310
Jiahuan,

531
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,790
you should give up on this idea.

532
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,230
Jiali is now living her own life.

533
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,030
She's not going to help you.

534
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,310
She prefers her dad.

535
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,500
She stops crying in your arms.

536
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,350
Good girl.

537
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,470
Are you hungry?

538
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,200
The Chinese New Year is coming.

539
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,840
This year,

540
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,960
what's the situation?

541
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Mom hasn't called.

542
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,300
I can't be bothered to call.

543
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,120
Jiaxi seems to have bought a house.

544
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Did you hear?

545
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,120
I heard.

546
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,880
Maybe Mom will spend
the New Year alone again.

547
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,960
She'll definitely be alone on the Eve.

548
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,200
Or she'll go
to Jiaxi's mother-in-law's place.

549
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,270
How tolerant Mom is.

550
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,310
If you and He don't mind,

551
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,790
bring Mom to your place on the Eve.

552
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,680
He doesn't have relatives anyway.

553
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,920
OK, I'll talk to Mom about it tomorrow.

554
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,470
Why so anxious?

555
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,160
I also need to talk to her
about the household registration.

556
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,580
Household registration?

557
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,980
The child's household registration.

558
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm planning to register it at home,

559
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,910
so she'll go to HNU Primary School.

560
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,470
Jiaxi did the same before.

561
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,470
Maybe Mom doesn't have a say in this.

562
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,920
Why?

563
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,510
Now,

564
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,790
maybe Mom doesn't own the house anymore.

565
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,270
Finally, she's asleep.

566
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,070
I really didn't expect this.

567
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,360
It took me so long.

568
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,160
You guys can't sleep

569
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,790
in the middle of the night now, right?

570
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,510
Yeah, she's tough.

571
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,760
It's hard work.

572
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,150
Take this.

573
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,310
When you had her, I left you alone.

574
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,120
I made her a sweater.

575
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,310
Do you like this color?

576
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,680
Thank you, Mom.

577
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,470
It looks really nice. Thanks, Mom.

578
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,740
You two are doing so well.

579
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,550
I'm happy for you.

580
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,330
Mom, I remember

581
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,160
it was an orange-red sofa.

582
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,270
Why did you switch back to the old one?

583
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,160
Jiaxi moved it to her place.

584
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,360
It's okay, Mom. Leave it to me.

585
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,750
I'll change it for you later.

586
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,270
No, no need.

587
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,510
I'm used to it.

588
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,160
This one's fine.

589
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,240
The leather one is so hard

590
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,710
and cold to sit on.

591
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,550
Okay.

592
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
Mom,

593
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,270
I want to discuss something with you.

594
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,120
What is it?

595
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,510
I'm planning to register
the child's household

596
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,600
at home.

597
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,470
It'll be easier

598
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,670
for school in the future.

599
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,040
Well.

600
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,710
Don't worry.

601
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,310
I have no interest in this house.

602
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,710
I'm just doing this for the child.

603
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,120
I'll discuss it with Jiaxi.

604
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,120
Why discuss it with her?

605
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,910
Does she control
the household registration?

606
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,990
No, not like that.

607
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,120
She's moved out
after buying a new house.

608
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,070
Ask her to move
the household registration.

609
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,160
Be quick about it.

610
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,360
Mom, you can't keep spoiling her
like this.

611
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,120
She's splitting up the family.

612
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,510
The New Year's coming.

613
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,090
Will you spend New Year's Eve

614
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,510
at Wang Huaimin's place again?

615
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,360
Mom, how about this?

616
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,160
Why don't you come
to our place this year?

617
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,550
No, no need.

618
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,120
I'll stay at home.

619
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
I'm used

620
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,120
to being alone.

621
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,920
Mom, can't you see it?

622
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,510
You drove Jiali away

623
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,550
and brought Jiaxi back.

624
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,200
Is life really better than before?

625
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,070
I can't just call Jiali back.

626
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
It's been so long.

627
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,160
She doesn't even call at festivals.

628
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,790
She's forgotten about me.

629
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,070
You took away what should be hers.

630
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,310
How can you expect her to call?

631
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,120
What do you mean by that?

632
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,870
Jiaxi's back. Don't get us wrong.

633
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,270
It's our family matter, not yours.

634
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,030
No, Xiaoling...

635
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,920
Sit down.

636
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,270
Stop trying to take advantage
of the situation

637
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,710
and speak ill of me in front of Mom.

638
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,470
Mom doesn't need you
to take care of her.

639
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,710
She's doing fine.

640
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,510
Do you think your money

641
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,790
has made you amazing?

642
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,790
How condescending.

643
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,820
What are you doing then?

644
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,060
You moved into your new flat,

645
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,120
leaving Mom all alone.

646
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,310
Aren't you the most filial?

647
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,910
Is that how you love her?

648
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,780
How ridiculous.

649
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,510
Liu Xiaoling, how many times
have you visited Mom?

650
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,250
Stop pretending to be
a dutiful daughter.

651
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,310
Do you have any conscience?

652
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,090
You've taken the house,
but you ignore Mom.

653
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
The New Year's coming,
yet you leave her alone.

654
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,120
Now you show up with food?

655
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,920
With a box?

656
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,400
Are you feeding pigs or dogs?

657
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,160
Aren't you afraid
of lightning striking you?

658
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,550
- Stop.
- If I get stricken,

659
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,310
I'll bring you down with me.

660
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,270
- You woke the kid up.
- I'm telling you.

661
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,310
You're a Liu.
It's none of your business.

662
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,270
Today, I'll show you if I can.

663
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,570
Who are you trying to fight with?

664
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,520
With you.

665
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,510
Are you crazy?
You're like a mad dog.

666
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,120
- Are you crazy?
- Are you even human?

667
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
What are you doing?

668
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,120
- Are you human?
- Are you human?

669
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,440
You...

670
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,750
- If you...
- Who are you fighting with?

671
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,000
With you!

672
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,150
Get out of here!

673
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,310
Get out!

674
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,790
Mom told you to leave.

675
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,310
You leave too.

676
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,600
I don't want to see anyone of you.

677
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,310
Not a single one.

678
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,170
We have to go back to the hometown

679
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,940
to burn winter clothes
for Dad and Grandma.

680
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,410
Mom surely knows how to trouble us.

681
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,400
You've got quite an appetite.

682
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,390
Look.

683
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,680
You're stuffed, huh?

684
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,830
Smell it.

685
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,270
Smell this chicken leg.

686
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,750
Has it gone bad?

687
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,760
No, it hasn't.

688
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,680
How can it not?

689
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,040
- Is everything okay?
- What's wrong?

690
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,150
Are you car-sick?

691
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,870
Hongyu, slow down.

692
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,760
Jiaxi.

693
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,590
Jiaxi.

694
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,310
Are you pregnant again?

695
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,910
What?

696
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,070
Really?

697
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,960
No, it's purely an accident.

698
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,080
It's not confirmed yet.

699
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,160
You better figure out
how to tell Xiaoman.

700
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,790
Jiayi, if she gets
a little brother or sister,

701
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
she'll be so happy.

702
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Maybe not.

703
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,350
It's Jiahuan.

704
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,350
Let me take it.

705
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I should announce

706
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,720
this happy news.

707
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Alright, go ahead.

708
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,880
Hello, Jiahuan, it's Jiayi.

709
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,200
Where's Jiaxi?

710
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,920
She's next to me. What's up?

711
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
Where's Mom?

712
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,120
Mom's at home.

713
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,120
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

714
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,070
Did you go to the house?

715
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,070
You have to call louder.

716
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,260
Mom's a bit hard of hearing.

717
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,710
I'm in the living room.

718
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,240
What's going on?

719
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,550
We can't call it a disappearance now.

720
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,310
It's not enough time.

721
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,990
Should we just wait around?

722
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,550
Jiahuan,

723
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
did you hide Mom away?

724
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,150
Are you acting like this on purpose?

725
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,180
Where would I hide her?

726
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,940
What would I gain?

727
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,120
Am I the one who's crazy, or is it you?

728
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,920
You two stop.

729
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,120
What are you doing?

730
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,510
There are three possibilities now.

731
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,790
First, she was kidnapped.

732
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,790
Second, she's lost.

733
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,960
Third, she intentionally left.

734
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,890
The third possibility
seems the most likely.

735
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,310
Mom?

736
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Mom?

737
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,430
Mom?

738
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,030
What happened?

739
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,550
Without saying anything,

740
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,670
who is she trying to fool?

741
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,960
Mom's angry. Don't you get it?

742
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Since we bought the house and moved,

743
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,150
I've noticed Mom's been off.

744
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,920
We've been busy outside all day.

745
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,030
Then we come home to eat and sleep.

746
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,960
How could Mom not feel lonely
by herself at home?

747
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,740
The New Year's coming,

748
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,090
so Mom's feeling down.

749
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,090
But I didn't ignore her
after I bought the house.

750
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,720
I have my own stuff to do.

751
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,320
I don't think you should sit there.

752
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,360
We need to start looking.

753
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,320
No need.

754
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,490
If she's intentionally gone,
we won't find her.

755
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,190
When the time comes, she'll come out.

756
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,990
Who are you?

757
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm the Vice GM of Shunde Tianyuan Food.

758
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,840
I was wondering
if Ms. Liu Meixin is at home.

759
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,760
Who?

760
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,920
Have you been
to my mom's pickled vegetable stall?

761
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,990
Yes, yes.

762
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,120
I want to talk to Ms. Liu

763
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,550
about the industrialization
of her pickled vegetables.

764
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,400
Industrialization?

765
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,760
Please sit down.

766
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,110
Let's talk. Come on.

767
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,880
Please sit. Go make some tea.

768
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,760
Where could Mom have gone?

769
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,760
We have no other relatives here

770
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,400
or extra houses.

771
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,920
She didn't go to Ms. Liu's place.

772
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,590
Zhu Deqi's wife's gone.

773
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,550
Mom's too frugal to go to a hotel.

774
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,840
Where could she go?

775
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
Let's think about it.

776
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,720
Let's search separately.

777
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,900
If there's no news by tomorrow,

778
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,060
we'll go to the police.

779
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,460
OK.

780
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,700
We'll go then, Jiali.

781
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,140
Where do you think Mom would go?

782
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,300
We've looked everywhere we can.

783
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,820
I think Mom's just mad.

784
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,060
Jiaxi bought the house

785
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,020
and pushed Mom away.

786
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,000
It's like burning the bridge
after crossing it.

787
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,620
Who wouldn't feel upset about that?

788
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,260
She brought it on herself.

789
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,660
She chose Jiaxi.

790
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,020
Jiaxi is the one she raised.

791
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,780
She should bear the consequences.

792
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,580
Do you think Mom's gone there?

793
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,100
It's been so long since we met.

794
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,540
You all look so beautiful.

795
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,080
Why's one of you missing?

796
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,860
She needs to be a bit late.

797
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,620
Your mom's doing alright here.

798
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,700
But she's been

799
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,680
feeling down.

800
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,300
When you see her, try to comfort her.

801
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,140
Did you hear that?

802
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,980
Meixin, Meixin.

803
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,620
Open the door, Meixin.

804
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,220
She's in the room.

805
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,820
Comfort your mom when you see her.

806
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,700
I'll leave now.

807
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,300
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Uncle.

808
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,700
Mom.

809
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,660
We're here.

810
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,900
Mom.

811
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,580
Uncle Zhong needs
to celebrate the New Year.

812
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,620
You can't

813
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,220
keep living here.

814
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,340
Mom,

815
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,780
if Jiaxi's been unkind to you,

816
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:50,730
we'll support you.

817
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,500
Mom,

818
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,900
please open the door.

819
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,060
Mom.

820
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
Mom.

821
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,180
I'm Jiali.

822
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,500
Mom.

823
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,980
Honestly, I didn't want to come today.

824
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,860
After all that happened,

825
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,220
I was kicked out.

826
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,420
But if you're really in trouble,

827
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,660
we won't turn a blind eye.

anything you're unhappy about,

830
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,300
we should talk it through at home.

831
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,460
Let's talk about everything.

832
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,020
Just tell us what the problem is.

833
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,620
We can solve it together.

834
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,740
Mom,

835
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,780
if you think you can't open the door,

836
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,700
we'll leave.

837
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,280
