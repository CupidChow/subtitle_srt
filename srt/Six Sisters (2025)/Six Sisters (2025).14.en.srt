Who's that?

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,220
Hi, Jiali.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,690
Who are you?

21
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,980
I'm Ouyang Bao's brother.

22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,130
He and Jiayi told me to bring this.

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,570
Jiali, I should go.

24
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,410

It's Jinhua Ham.

28

Meixin, instant noodles.

29
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,890
Look.

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,730
They're really hard to get now.

31
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,690
They sent a vanguard.

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,780
Will Jiayi and Ouyang
come back for the Chinese New Year?

33
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,260
Yes, I guess.

34
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,290
They've sent the presents.

35
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,260

Jiahuan.

39
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,450
Happy Chinese New Year.

40
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,660
I'm making dumplings.

41
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,290
Wait. They'll be ready soon.

42
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,690
Where's Qiufang?

43
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,060
She's on duty today

44
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
and can't come back.

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,730
What about Qiulin?

46
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,890
He isn't back yet.

47
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,060
Didn't he say he would come back?

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,780
Yes. He'll be back.

49
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,620
Today.

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
I think he's arriving.

51
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,780
Such a lovely cat.

52
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,890
What's its name?

53
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,730
It's Hert..

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,890
Hert... Hertz.

55
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,730
Hertz, I think.

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,340
Qiulin gave it this name.

57
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,570
I can hardly pronounce it.

58
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,970
Mom.

59
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,890
He's back. Open the door.

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,940
Qiulin, what took you so long?

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Jiahuan, you're here.

62
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,180
Mom.

63
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,780
Come meet someone.

64
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,130
(Meng Lisha)
My classmate Meng Lisha.

65
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,100
Nice to meet you, madam.

66
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,690
This is my mother.

67
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,260
This is my best friend Jiahuan.

68
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,130
Nice to meet you.

69
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,170
Hurry. Come on in.

70
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,380
Come in.

71
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,900
Does it taste better
than my chicken soup?

72
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,810
Not at all. Not even close.

73
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,140
Taste it, Mom.

74
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,250
It tastes really good.

75
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,610
Jiali, what do you think?

76
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,930
Mom, you make better food.

77
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,340
Far better.

78
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
I won't eat any.

79
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,540
I'm just getting some for Jianguo.

80
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
Does it taste good?

81
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,900
Xiaonian.

82
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,140
Let Great-grandma taste some, ok?

83
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,690
Come on.

84
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,900
We're behind the age.

85
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,250
Come on. You taste some.

86
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,390
No.

87
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,250
Grandma,

88
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,700
it tastes really great.

89
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,050
My mother failed to buy some for me.

90
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Mom, it smells so good.

91
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,410
What's in it?

92
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,580
We've been expecting this meal.

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,730
Come on. Let's drink.

94
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,730
Cheers.

95
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,850
Wish our family will prosper

96
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,580
and get more lively.

97
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,690
Good point.

98
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,730
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Grandma, Mom.

99
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,730
Wish you good health.

100
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,690
Wish you good health.

101
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,460
Grandma, Great-grandma,
wish you good health.

102
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,780
Xiaonian, you stay healthy, too.

103
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,220
Happy Chinese New Year.

104
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,380
Cheers.

105
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,700
- Braised pork.
- Braised pork?

106
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,540
Ok.

107
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,780
We just have fewer members here.

108
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,100
Don't say that.

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,900
We have more members.

110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,170
Look, we have Xiaonian.

111
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,850
You're a grandma now.

112
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,570
That's right.

113
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,700
We'll have more family members.

114
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,490
- Indeed.
- Yes.

115
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,850
Jiahuan, what are you doing?

116
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,930
Why are you washing?

117
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,170
Didn't I ask you not to do that?

118
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,420
There are lice.

119
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,850
Impossible.

120
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,340
It's the 20th century.

121
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,980
The lice are extinct.

122
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,660
- How boring.
- It's over.

123
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,730
Shall we set off the firework rocket?

124
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,780
Ok.

125
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,610
I'll set it off.

126
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,370
You do it.

127
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,530
I'm scared.

128
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,010
I don't dare, either.

129
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,770
Get Jiahuan here.

130
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,490
She's more afraid.

131
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,940
Firecrackers injured her, remember?

132
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,530
Let's set off something else.

133
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,610
Where's the bullet firework?

134
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,580
I can't afford any.

135
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,100
You didn't spend any money.

136
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,940
This is all we have.

137
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,580
Stingy girl. I'll set it off.

138
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,780
- So fun.
- So fun.

139
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,220
Let's try another one.

140
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,610
Mom.

141
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,820
Jiali.

142
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,850
Grandma.

143
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,570
Mom.

144
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,730
Happy Chinese New Year.

145
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,060
Jiayi.

146
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,700
You're back, Jiayi.

147
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,530
- Grandma.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

148
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,980
- You're back.
- Feng.

149
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,060
- Say hello.
- Here.

150
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,130
Say hello to Great-grandma.

151
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,220
This is Great-grandma.

152
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,010
Lucky money for him?

153
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,700
- Take the money.
- Thanks.

154
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,650
Don't stand here.

155
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,940
- Get in and talk.
- Come in.

156
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,370
Come on.

157
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,610
Great-grandma will get you inside.

158
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,450
It's ok.

159
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,820
- Feng.
- Good boy.

160
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,100
- Good boy.
- Look, you're home.

161
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,730
Oh my God.

162
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,420
Jiayi.

163
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,890
Jiayi.

164
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,530
You smell so good.

165
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,340
Jiayi,

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,650
you're great.

167
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,770
You win.

168
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,370
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,060
You're the smartest lady

170
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,850
in this area.

171
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,730
Don't be surprised.

172
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,370
I've always been.

173
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,370
Look how proud she is.

174
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,730
She always wanted to show off.

175
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,100
Let her be.

176
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,340
Why hasn't Jianguo come yet?

177
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,220
He's on duty.

178
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
He'll come at noon.

179
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,650
What about Jiawen?

180
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,490
Her mother-in-law is ill.

181
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,250
Feng, guess which one is Mom.

182
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,300
Mom was a pretty kid, right?

183
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
Look at this.

184
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,700
Guess which one

185
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
is your 18-year-old mother.

186
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,300
Oh, you know it.

187
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,730
You recognize Mom, right?

188
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,100
- Jiayi, we want to try on your coat.
- Come on.

189
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,570
Go ahead.

190
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,370
Jiahuan,

191
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,490
how could you be such a mess?

192
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,770
Your leather jacket

193
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,770
is far worse than Dad's.

194
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,570
Right.

195
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,370
Dad,

196
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,580
you owe me a sheepskin jacket.

197
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,940
Feng, look.

198
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,700
This is Grandpa.

199
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,100
Grandpa cared the most about Mom.

200
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,780
He's a nice man.

201
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,340
(Harmony)

202
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,210
Chicken soup.

203
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,110
Make way.

204
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,610
Thank you, Jianguo.

205
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,420
- Good.
- Smells good.

206
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,370
Smells so good.

207
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,370
Help yourselves.

208
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,570
Oh.

209
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,490
Let me fill your cup.

210
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,500
Ok.

211
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,180
Did you eat the noodles?

212
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,300
- Yes.
- Super tasty.

213
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,100
Ouyang took some trouble to buy them.

214
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,340
They're in short supply.

215
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,700
Buy some for us, too.

216
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,130
We'll pay.

217
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,770
We'll pay properly.

218
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,060
Don't say that, Jianguo.

219
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,130
We're a family.

220
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,980
Yeah. Don't say that.

221
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,820
Right.

222
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,940
What about the ham?

223
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,650
Did you eat it?

224
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,340
- It's from Jinhua.
- Good.

225
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,060
We got it from Shanghai.

226
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,890
We still prefer salted meat.

227
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,010
She hung it on the wall.

228
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,370
We'll eat it later.

229
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,610
Would you like some meat?

230
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,650
- Yes.
- Ok.

231
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,140
Mom,

232
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,650
has the soup gone stale?

233
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,130
Impossible.

234
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,300
It's authentic chicken soup.

235
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,460
I think it's stale, really.

236
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,490
No way.

237
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,300
That's the flavor.

238
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,340
You ate too much soup
of the instant noodles.

239
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,730
Seriously?

240
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,700
Don't be mad,

241
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,730
whether it's stale.

242
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,580
Drink some if you disagree.

243
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,370
I won't drink, anyway.

244
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,250
Just like that. Very simple.

245
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,490
I think in this family,

246
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,940
the standard never changes.

247
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,060
All the time.

248
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,690
Give me some.

249
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,810
Say no more.

250
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,660
Come on.

251
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Shall we drink together?

252
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,490
- Ok.
- Come on.

253
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

254
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,980
Grandma, wish you good health.

255
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,220
- Keep fit.
- Cheers.

256
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,420
Mom, keep fit.

257
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,780
Ok.

258
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,250
Did you reserve the room?

259
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,180
Yes.

260
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,180
Tomorrow is my treat.

261
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,890
The biggest room at Jinman Restaurant.

262
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,820
Hooray.

263
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Jiayi, it's nice of you.

264
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,490
Don't show off.

265
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,730
Let me say something.

266
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,180
The world changes and people change.

267
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,250
The family changes, too.

268
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,180
If you always think in old ways,

269
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,300
it won't be good.

270
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,130
When I married Ouyang,

271
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,700
no one supported me but Jiawen.

272
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,180
Some guys

273
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,460
tried so hard to stop me.

274
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,900
What about now?

275
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,340
Now, you live a good life.

276
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,700
We're happy for you.

277
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,300
Thank you, Jiali.

278
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,580
He Jiayi,

279
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,100
are you back here to show off?

280
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,180
Come on.

281
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,130
What's gone is gone.

282
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,300
We're having lunch.

283
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,180
Stop arguing.

284
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,610
Jiayi, Ouyang,

285
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,770
listen.

286
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,130
You always belong in this family.

287
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,700
But remember.

288
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,370
Be a law-abiding businessman.

289
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,610
Be a decent man, too.

290
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,420
Now, you're living a good life.

291
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,340
We're all happy for you.

292
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,130
Jiayi, remember.

293
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,610
You're always
the third daughter of this family.

294
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,370
Don't get carried away.

295
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,180
We're always ordinary people.

296
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,820
Understand?

297
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,730
Grandma, we get it.

298
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,570
Say something.

299
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,770
Go ahead.

300
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,970
I get it.

301
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,850
Let's eat.

302
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,820
Get me more soup.

303
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,100
I also want more, Ouyang.

304
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,180
- Ok.
- Me, too.

305
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,040
Ok.

306
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,900
Give me some, too.

307
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,530
Don't you have hands?

308
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,060
Ok. Ouyang, come on.

309
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,370
- Let's drink.
- Ok.

310
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,490
- Don't smirk.
- I'm happy.

311
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,300
The soup is tasty.

312
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,420
Your bangs are gone.

313
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,180
Take it back.

314
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,820
Why? It's for you.

315
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,780
Take it.

316
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,420
It's a gift. It's yours.

317
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,530
It's mine, huh?

318
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,440
Right.

319
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,370
I can do anything with it, right?

320
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,340
Yes, of course.

321
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,060
What happened?

322
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,860
(Principles of Dialectical
and Historical Materialism)

323
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,570
I got you an orange. Would you like it?

324
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,460
What are you doing?

325
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,610
Going back to school.

326
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,810
The festival isn't over.

327
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,730
Why are you in a hurry?

328
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,540
For work in the lab.

329
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,810
Why does an accountant work in the lab?

330
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,330
It's a work-study program.

331
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,330
To make a living.

332
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,330
I'll cool it down.

333
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,370
Is it ok?

334
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,260
Yes.

335
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,530
You had hard work.

336
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,940
Not at all, Mom.

337
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
It's not hard work.

338
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,730
It's our duty.

339
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,420
Don't worry about anything.

340
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,940
Just rest and get well.

341
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,900
You'll take care of Guangming.

342
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,730
You eat too little.

343
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,140
Sorry to be your burden.

344
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,250
Stop. Don't say that.

345
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,370
Come on.

346
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,770
One last bite.

347
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,540
Here.

348
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,220
Eat some more.

349
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,330
The leader made his point.

350
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,900
The number of workers is fixed.

351
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,330
Without a quota, she can't
be a full-time worker.

352
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,730
How about she gets
a temporary job for now?

353
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,570
She needs to make a living.

354
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,380
Now, Jiahuan is doing all right.

355
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,770
Xiaoling took over her dad's job.

356
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Jiaxi is left alone.

357
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,420
She has nothing to do.

358
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,620
How about doing business?

359
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,380
Just like Tang Weimin.

360
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,140
Is she as capable as Tang Weimin?

361
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
She can't do that.

362
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,090
Why can't she?

363
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Tang Weimin is disabled.

364
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,740
But Jiaxi is able-bodied.

365
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,410
Jiali,

366
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,810
can Jianguo do something?

367
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,900
He tried really hard.

368
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,140
He isn't a stranger.

369
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,810
He must have tried his best.

370
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,420
But the leader insists

371
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,700
that the number is fixed.

372
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,090
What's so hard about this?

373
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,010
Mom's early retirement

374
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,530
will give Jiaxi a job.

375
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,700
Ms. Fang living at the end of the lane

376
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,010
gave her job to her son.

377
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,530
Mom will retire in a few years.

378
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,490
Even in this case, Jiaxi can only
work in Soy Sauce Factory

379
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,810
instead of May Day Shopping Mall.

380
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,330
Mom, it takes steps.

381
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,940
She'll work at Soy Sauce Factory

382
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
before being transferred
to May Day Shopping Mall.

383
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,220
It's the intra-system transfer.

384
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,180
Much easier.

385
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,330
She should get a job first.

(Huainan Chunyan Brewing Factory)

387
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,490
What are you thinking?

388
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,220
Nothing.

389
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,530
Did you hear?

390
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,530
We're doing early retirement now.

391
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,370
Ladies,

392
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,980
don't leave after work.

393
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,530
Why? Will you buy us dinner?

394
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,980
You're right.

395
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,380
I'll buy you dinner.

396
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,730
What for?

397
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm not coming next week.

398
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,710
- Why?
- Why?

399
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,620
I applied for early retirement.

400
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,730
My child will take over my job.

401
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,730
Look.

402
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,290
He's such a good father.

403
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,010
I don't have a choice.

404
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,730
- People do everything for children.
- Right.

405
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,220
They have to get a job.

406
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,170
Right.

407
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,500

Tang Zhenmin.

409
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,240
Fancy shoes.

410
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,490
You dance very well.

411
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,700
Of course. I'm the Queen of Fashion.

412
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,380
Queen of Fashion,

413
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,570
Liu Xiaoling.

414
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,180
Don't call me that.

415
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,850
Call me Kelly.

416
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,770
When we dance, call me Kelly.

417
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,610
Kelly?

418
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,810
The queen in Breakin'?

419
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,090
- That's her.
- Kelly.

420
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,300
Call me that.

421
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,330
Liu Xiaoling.

422
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,740
Kelly.

423
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,570
I want a stage name, too.

424
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,330
Why? You don't need it.

425
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,570
When we do breakdance,

426
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,410
they'll say,

427
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,770
"Kelly and Tang Zhenmin".

428
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
They aren't a match.

429
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,700
I don't want a match.

430
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,980
Don't be boring.

431
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:12,930
How about this?

432
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,490
I'll call you Turbo.

433
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,090
Turbo?

434
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,700
Kelly and Turbo.

435
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,160
Sounds great.

436
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,010
Ok, huh? Turbo.

437
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,740
Here.

438
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,330
Do a moonwalk.

439
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,940
Turbo, do a glass wiping.

440
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,700
Let me show you the real moonwalk.

441
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,370
Look.

442
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,330
Be careful.

443
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,850
Tang Zhenmin!

444
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,660
Somebody help! Anybody?

445
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,180
Are you ok?

446
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,330
I... I did a poor job.

447
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,540
I... I slipped.

448
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,900
Come on.

449
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,050
Stop laughing, ok?

450
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,930
Pull me up.

451
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,900
Come on.

452
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,020

Come on, Meixin.

455
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Think carefully about it.

456
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,570
If the application is submitted,

457
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,090
there'll be no turning back.

458
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,900
You'll lose half of your pay.

459
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,900
I've made up my mind.

460
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,740
Really.

461
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,020
Well...

462
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,250
Children are the most important.

463
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,570
And I've been working
for most of my life.

464
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,940
I will rest.

465
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,130
Come on, Jiaxi.

466
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,860
Look at this.

467
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,660
Look.

468
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,390
This is unfinished soy sauce.

469
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
Understand?

Ms. Li. This is Ms. Li.

This is Jiaxi, Meixin's daughter.

472
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,660
I know.

473
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,620
Come on. Look.

474
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,530
This is where you can stop.

475
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,370
Understand?

476
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,500
Come on.

477
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,980
I've stirred it. You try it.

478
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,180
- Ok.
- Go ahead.

479
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,490
That's not right.

480
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,460
Let me teach you.

481
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,540
Watch closely.

482
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,940
Sink it and lift it.

483
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,930
Press it down there.

484
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,380
Break the soy sauce bar.

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,290
Fancy, isn't it?

487
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,530
Try again.

488
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,090
The two rows of jars are yours.

489
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,490
So many jars? When can I finish?

490
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,700
You'll get used to that.

491
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,460
That's what your mother and me do.

492
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,700
Right.

493
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,900
Good. Go on with it.

494
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,170
Mom,

495
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,180
your work is so hard.

496
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,330
The jar is so big.

497
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,090
It's so hard to stir.

498
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,490
Your mother worked for her lifetime.

499
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,090
You only worked for days.

500
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,570
Why can't you stand it anymore?

501
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,900
Hang in there.

502
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:24,050
Grandma, you don't know
how hard the work is.

503
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,620
That's it, Mom. It hurts.

504
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,050
There's no turning back.

505
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,900
You have to work, however hard it is.

506
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,570
This is a serious job.

507
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,530
I begged for it.

508
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,660
I know you prefer May Day Shopping Mall.

509
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,770
But not now.

510
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,250
Later, Jiali and Jianguo

511
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,290
will try to do something.

512
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah.

513
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,140
Jiaxi, you must go through a hard time.

514
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,900
Mom can't take care of you forever.

515
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,700
That's right.

516
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,730
Your mother did everything for you.

517
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,180
She even handed over her job to you.

518
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,460
You must be...

519
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,570
I'll take care of Mom.

520
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,140
I'll give her everything.

521
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,490
Good food and fancy clothes.

522
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,660
She'll be happy.

523
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,290
Meixin,

524
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,730
have you applied for the job transfer?

525
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,460
Jiali and Jianguo are working on it.

526
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,570
Ask them to help me out.

527
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,140
Where are the workers?

528
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,980
He Jiaxi? He Jiaxi!

529
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,810
- He Jiaxi!
- I'm here.

530
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,140
Hey, you freaked me out.

531
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,140
What were you doing?

532
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,020
Sleeping again?

533
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,460
No, no. I was checking if the bottom

534
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,180
- was leaking.
- You know what?

535
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,700
Get packed and leave now.

536
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,090
Director, I wasn't slacking off.

537
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,140
I was working.

538
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,980
Stop.

539
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,530
You know what?

540
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,700
You're transferred
to May Day Shopping Mall.

541
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,330
Stop bothering me. Leave now.

542
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,700
What a worker.

543
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,660
(May Day Shopping Mall)

544
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,500
Here. Take it.

545
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,180
Come back if you like.

546
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,020
Wang.

547
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,740
There you are, Jiali.

(Wang Huaimin)

550
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,090
She's all grown up.

551
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,050
How time flies.

552
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,640
Say hello.

553
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,090
Hello, Ms. Wang.

554
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,570
Call her sister.

555
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,050
Hello, sister.

556
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,570
I'm He Jiaxi.

557
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,250
I'm new here.

558
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,770
Can I work with you?

559
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,890
She's so honey-lipped.

560
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,250
I'm not your sister.

561
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,530
She's your real sister.

562
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,490
Then, call her Master.

563
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,330
Wang, you'll be her master.

564
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,620
Fine. No problem.

565
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,330
Rest assured when she works with me.

566
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,900
Master, let me do it.

567
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,330
You just tell me what to do.

568
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,090
She's young and naive.

569
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,130
You will

570
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,250
teach her more.

571
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,490
No problem. Look, she's wise.

572
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,330
Quite hard-working.

573
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,020
Mom,

574
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,570
I'll work at May Day Shopping Mall.

575
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,860
Just now, Jiali

576
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,570
introduced me to my master.

577
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,050
Your hard work pays off.

578
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,490
Do a good job there.

579
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,570
You'll also stand behind the counter.

580
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,090
Will your legs be ok?

581
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,090
That's different.

582
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,980
The mall is crowded.

583
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,730
Better than staying by a soy sauce jar.

584
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,530
You're always annoying.

585
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,650
So what?

586
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,940
Liu Xiaoling, how can you complain?

587
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,460
You took over Dad's job.

588
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,570
I did, so what?

589
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,490
You took Mom's job.

590
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,380
What makes you proud?

591
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Come on. Stop fighting.

592
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
You both have a job.

593
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,980
Work hard, then.

594
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,700
Talk less and work more.

595
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,740
You have no idea

596
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,490
how boring my retirement life is.

597
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,700
Retirement life is good.

598
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,730
Mom, will I live like this
for the rest of my life?

599
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,140
Xiaonian, what happened to your head?

600
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,610
What happened?

601
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,740
Who did this?

602
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,420
The boys at Yaojiaowan attacked me.

603
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,490
I'll go avenge you.

604
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,290
He Xiangdong, you made trouble again.

605
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,180
Come on. Umm...

606
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,290
Is his head hit?

607
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,900
- What happened?
- This isn't enough, huh?

608
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,980
No, no, no.

609
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,980
We'll go to hospital.

610
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,330
There you go.

611
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
Go to hospital.

612
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,330
Or we'll be worried.

613
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,540
Let's go.

614
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,140
Poor boy.

615
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,860
What happened?

616
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,090
Why did you fight again?

617
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,420
Those boys fought me first.

618
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,290
Why did you fight back?

619
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,860
They tried to grab territory.

620
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,380
Territory? This isn't the old society.

621
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,860
What are you, a bandit or road hog?

622
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,490
I was doing justice.

623
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,380
Justice?

624
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,220
Don't talk back.

625
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,220
Come out.

626
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,290
I'll teach you a good lesson.

627
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,380
Slow down there.

628
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,700
Mom, let him tell you.

629
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,250
What did you promise?

630
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,140
How will you be punished?

631
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,700
I'll be beaten.

632
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,860
Exactly. Stand still.

633
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,290
I didn't stir up trouble. I defy you.

634
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,290
I said, stand still.

635
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,410
Come out.

636
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,570
Come over here.

637
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,890
Come.

638
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,320
Come on.

639
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,700
- Jianguo.
- Jianguo.

640
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,860
No one can help you today.

641
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,520
Let go.

642
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,060
- Jianguo.
- Stand still.

643
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,300
Jianguo.

644
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,620
You fought and made trouble.

645
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,780
How dare you?

646
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,220
Jianguo, stop it.

647
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,460
His head is injured.

648
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,570
He learned his lesson.

649
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,620
Mom, Xiaonian is my son.

650
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,660
I must discipline him.

651
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,380
- Come on.
- Jianguo.

652
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,570
If you keep punishing him,

653
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,770
he might get hurt.

654
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,180
We may go into shock.

655
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,570
Xiaonian, come here.

656
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,490
Fine. You should go.

657
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,420
Go home. Go.

658
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,500
I'll discipline him.

659
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,170
Jianguo.

660
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,220
Go back. Come on.

661
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,370
Don't worry.

662
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,020
Go home.

663
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,770
You can't hit him like that.

664
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,180
Oh, Xiaonian.

665
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,940
Zhang Jianguo,

666
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,380
you were being too rude.

667
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm doing this for our son's good.

668
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,900
Think about him.

669
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,570
He's way too naughty.

670
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,460
You're a loving mother.

671
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,980
Then, I'm a strict father.

672
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,180
You're a strict father,

673
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,220
not a power holder.

674
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,940
Besides, Xiaonian is a little boy.

675
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,730
How could you beat him

676
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,570
in front of my mother and grandma?

677
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,140
Don't worry.

678
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,090
Xiaonian is very strong.

679
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,620
See? He beats people and gets beaten.

680
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,010
A boy like him

681
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,900
should join the army

682
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,570
when he grows up.

683
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,250
Don't find an excuse.

684
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,940
You scared my mother.

685
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,220
If anything happens to her,

686
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,220
I'll...

687
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,570
You'll what?

688
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,780
I'll divorce you.

689
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,010
What are you talking about?

690
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,660
How could you divorce me

691
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,220
for such a little thing?

692
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,140
People want a divorce
after they're upset

693
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,180
by many little things.

694
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,700
I know.

695
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,010
And something in the past.

696
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,860
What do you mean?

697
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,330
Something you did before.

698
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,730
What did I do?

699
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,420
Romeo and Juliet.

700
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,570
Foreigners? I don't understand.

701
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,980
All the neighbors know that.

702
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,530
It was something before we got married.

703
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,980
You finally admit it.

704
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,130
Come on, Zhang Jianguo.

705
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,980
All these years,

706
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,570
you've kept it all bottled up.

707
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,610
I'm not that narrow-minded.

708
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,170
Would I even care?

709
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,980
Now,

710
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,820
you're my wife.

711
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,860
That's enough for me.

712
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,170
But from now on,

713
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
don't ask for a divorce.

714
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,740
Then, you mustn't hit our son again.

715
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,780
Even when he is wrong?

716
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,780
Just scare him a little bit.

717
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,980
Got it, my Juliet.

718
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,170
Who's Juliet?

719
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,530
Juliet and Romeo

720
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,980
lived in a small town.

721
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,740
They fell in love at first sight.

722
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,340
But their families were enemies

723
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,180
for generations.

724
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,610
Just like your family
and the Tang Family.

725
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,740
Say no more.

726
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,010
You're not Romeo, anyway.

727
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,780
What did you say?

728
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,460
Careful it's hot.

729
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,700
(The Dragon Boat Festival, 1987)

730
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,700
Mom.

731
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,660
Grandma.

732
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,420
You must have made a fortune.

733
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Come on,

734
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,530
you should save some money.

735
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,380
Get some secret money for yourself.

736
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,610
Mom, this is for you.

737
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,740
Come on.

738
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,050
Just take it.

739
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,050
I work as usual.

740
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,650
Ouyang does business.

741
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,940
Mom, you know what?

742
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,650
Money is everywhere.

743
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,650
See if you want it.

744
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,970
Seriously,

745
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,530
when Ouyang left his factory,

746
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,860
I really worried about you.

747
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,130
We're doing good, aren't we?

748
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,980
Hard-working people never starve.

749
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,340
Look, Weimin

750
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,170
runs a bakery.

751
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,570
His business does very well.

752
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,260
The line can be super long.

753
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,610
Will the good business last long?

754
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,900
Ouyang and I do different things.

755
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,340
He does business

756
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,610
while I have a job.

757
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,940
I won't discard art, anyway.

758
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,570
There you are, Jiayi.

759
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,570
Where's Grandma?

760
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,130
Lying in her room.

761
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,610
Jiayi, stand up and let me see.

762
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,780
Such a fancy dress.

763
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,530
How does it look? Elegant, huh?

764
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,780
It's not even sold in my shopping mall.

765
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,530
It's from Shanghai. An export.

766
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,210
Oh, I see.

767
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,580
I should go.

768
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,340
Mom, I have to go.

769
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,260
See you, Jiayi.

770
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,010
- Bye.
- There you are, Jiayi.

771
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,530
You also came, Jiali.

772
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,050
Quite a lot of visitors.

773
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,010
Have dinner here.

774
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,050
I bought rice dumplings.

775
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,570
No. I have to go home.

776
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,980
Feng is waiting for me.

777
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,010
In his grandpa's?

778
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
In our own house.

779
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,010
I took your advice

780
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,170
and hired a nanny.

781
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,210
She's from Hebei.

782
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,010
Bye, Mom.

783
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,620
Bye, Jiali.

784
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,210
Glad she lives a good life.

785
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,050
How's your work

786
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,580
with Wang Huaimin?

787
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,740
Not bad. I have sore legs, though.

788
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,380
Don't say that when you're working.

789
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,780
You always complain

790
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,380
about everything.

791
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,380
You had sore legs back in the factory.

792
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,940
Mother cared too much for you.

793
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,530
Or you couldn't get this new job.

794
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,740
When you're at work,

795
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,010
obey your master Wang Huaimin.

796
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
You know what?

797
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,780
Money problem
is the biggest fear of a shop assistant.

798
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,610
Don't take any money you don't deserve.

799
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,980
Mom, look.

800
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,740
She still treats me like a kid.

801
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,530
She cares for you.

802
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,340
Jiahuan will come back
in a couple of days.

803
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,530
After graduation,

804
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,530
the job thing is the biggest concern.

805
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,980
A college student will be offered a job.

806
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,170
She'll just accept the job.

807
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,980
The rice dumplings are still hot.

808
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,860
No filling or jujube filling.

809
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,010
I want the latter.

810
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,380
Jiali, your hands are chapped.

811
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,050
We have the hand cream. Use some.

812
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,050
- Mom.
- Use more.

813
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,890
It's mince filling.

814
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,610
Where is the hand cream?

815
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,820
(Hertz)

816
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,850
Hertz.

817
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,010
How are you doing at school?

818
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,650
I haven't heard from you
for a long time.

819
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,740
You write back really slowly.

820
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,690
I hear you're very busy in the lab

821
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,740
and will return on the last day.

822
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,490
When you're back,
we'll celebrate it together.

823
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,340
Mom, I'm leaving. I'll come tomorrow.

824
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,460
Who's Hertz?

825
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,930
Who?

826
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,570
Ms. Liu's cat.

827
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,900
I can't spell that name.

828
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,780
So, I call it Herzl.

829
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,490
It's a really fat cat.

830
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,330
Jiali.

831
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,980
How's it going?

832
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,010
What do you mean?

833
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,340
Your education.

834
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,090
You'll graduate soon.

835
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,300
Will you get an assigned job?

836
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,900
Yes.

837
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,690
Where will you work? In a bank?

838
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,700
Where is it?

839
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,140
In Bengbu.

840
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,140
Bengbu?

841
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,860
Did you tell Mom or Grandma?

842
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,530
You're the first one to know.

843
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,380
Which area in Bengbu?

844
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,650
Farm. They need an accountant.

845
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,530
Farm?

846
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,090
It's the same as the countryside.

847
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,050
Jiali,

848
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,780
I know you'll think

849
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,300
it's tough and tiring in the farm.

850
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,300
It's a terrible place

851
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
and worse than home.

852
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,260
But I'm old enough

853
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,170
to be responsible for my own behavior.

854
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,490
I can also be responsible for them.

855
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,900
This is your business.

856
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,740
This is also a family business.

857
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,580
Jiali,

858
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,530
respect me for this once, ok?

859
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,130
I know you'll try again

860
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,210
to persuade me by saying

861
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,050
"family comes first".

862
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,490
But that doesn't work on me.

863
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,090
This family stays, whoever leaves.

864
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,130
It works well when Dad is gone, right?

865
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,620
Fine.

866
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,530
You can work in Bengbu.

867
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,090
- For what reason?
- No reason.

868
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,900
You choose a poor place
instead of a good one.

869
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,740
You do have a reason.

870
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,090
I think Bengbu is a good place.

871
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,740
It's better than Huainan.

872
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,690
I want to stay far away from home

873
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,300
and live alone, ok?

874
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,490
Who's Hertz?

875
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,530
He's a man, right?

876
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,170
Are you going to Bengbu

877
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,170
because of this man?

878
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,860
Is it Zhang Qiulin?

879
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,090
He has nothing to do with this!

880
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,740
Jiahuan,

881
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,460
don't punish yourself

882
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,300
for someone else's mistake.

883
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,860
Zhang Qiulin is blind.
