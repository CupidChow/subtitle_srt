00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,380
I'll take care of you in the future.

16
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,010
Just hearing that from you

17
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,740
makes me happy.

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
About your future wife,

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,380
have you discussed all the conditions?

20
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,740
The two families will meet tomorrow.

21
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,580
Alright.

22
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,540
After you get married,

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,460
will you live with your parents?

24
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,740
I definitely would like to.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,980
But my Mom worries about you
and grand grandma.

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,380
She'll probably stay here for now.

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,560
Let's see what she decides then.

28
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,700
You know your Mom has had
a hard time these years.

29
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,780
After marriage,

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,660
remember to treat her well.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,220
She's been through a lot to be respected.

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,060
You need to make sure that

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,140
Li Wen takes good care of her,

34
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,980
and let her live comfortably, got it?

35
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,100
Of course.

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,380
Why are you worried?

37
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,660
Tomorrow,

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,780
are you sure you don't need me there?

39
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,340
They're sending a woman to handle it.

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,540
We can't possibly send a man, right?

41
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,660
Don't worry, it's nothing serious.

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,140
No matter what they say tomorrow,

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,140
just agree first.

44
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,100
If it's reasonable, I agree.

45
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,820
If it's unreasonable, I won't agree.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,700
Why?

47
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,820
Are you afraid our son can't find a wife?

48
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,780
He's tall

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,260
and handsome.

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,820
He's got a good job,

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,100
and a great family.

52
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,420
Our son is picky.

53
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,420
It's not easy for him to like someone.

54
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,940
Don't worry. I can imagine

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,780
what conditions Li Wen's mom will ask for.

56
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,540
It's nothing more than a house
and betrothal gifts,

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,840
maybe some appliances.

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,820
Let's just go with the market standard.

59
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,520
If we give the house to Xiangdong,

60
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,380
we'll have to keep living

61
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,580
with Mom here.

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,140
I'm talking with you.

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
In my opinion,

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,420
we should pay Mom some rent each month.

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,260
We live in our own house,

66
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,140
why should we pay rent?

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,340
Mom won't say it out loud,

68
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,540
but we should show some appreciation.

69
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Why do you think so much?

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,820
Thinking more is always good.

71
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,460
Mrs. Li, try this,

72
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,780
braised soft-shelled turtle.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,140
We don't cook this at home.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,380
Indeed.

75
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,140
It's the signature dish here.

76
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,300
Wen, help yourself.

77
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,380
Okay.

78
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,980
Xiangdong's Mom,

79
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,780
we're all happy today.

80
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,980
- I'll be honest.
- Go ahead.

81
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,020
I'm fully satisfied with Xiangdong.

82
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,100
Wen is a good girl, too.

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
When it comes to marriage,

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,900
we have to follow the rules.

85
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
Of course.

86
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,580
Other conditions aren't important.

87
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
You must have one thing:

88
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,740
A house.

89
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,740
We have a house.

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,380
It's already prepared.

91
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,900
In the Longhu Community,

92
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
two bedrooms.

93
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,980
Isn't it a bit small?

94
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,340
It's enough for two people.

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,820
What if they have kids?

96
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,020
It'll still be more than enough.

97
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,380
What if the elders come to stay?

98
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
Sleep on the floor?

99
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,220
You need a three-bedroom apartment at least.

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,580
Don't worry, Mrs. Li.

101
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,820
We'll discuss it when we return.

102
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,380
We'll find a solution.

103
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
It's not a problem at all.

104
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,220
The worst is

105
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,780
I retire early,

106
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,260
and apply for a larger house.

107
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,900
The problem will be solved.

108
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,220
Are you crazy?

109
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,660
Aren't you aiming for county level leader?

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,220
After all this effort, now you give up?

111
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,260
You've finally made it this far.

112
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,700
It's just a better title.

113
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,580
No. Retirement benefits are different, too.

114
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,580
What else can we do?

115
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,540
How about we buy a house?

116
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,020
A three-bedroom one?

117
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,020
How much would that cost?

118
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,660
Do we have enough money?

119
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,340
Li Wen's family is

120
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,540
insistent on this issue.

121
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,220
It's understandable.

122
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,780
They want their daughter's future

123
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,900
to be better.

124
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,220
Isn't this the negotiation stage?

125
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,380
Everyone wants to settle it in one go.

126
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,140
- Grandma.
- Jianguo.

127
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,460
You haven't slept?

128
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,580
I heard what you said.

129
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,700
I heard everything.

130
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,340
Your hearing is working again.

131
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,980
If you have no other choice,

132
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,100
give this house to Xiangdong
for his marriage.

133
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,220
How can that be?

134
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,540
If

135
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,580
this house is given to him,

136
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,700
where will you live?

137
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,780
Can't your mom and I stay with you?

138
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,780
This house doesn't belong to anyone,

139
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,660
how could you give it to Xiangdong?

140
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,220
Your dad married you to Jianguo back then

141
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,220
just to find a son-in-law for old age care.

142
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,340
He even changed his son's surname.

143
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,700
Xiangdong's surname is He.

144
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,220
He's our family's eldest grandson,

145
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,140
our own grandson.

146
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,220
This house is given to him.

147
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,820
No one will object.

148
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
Mom,

149
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,780
whom are you giving the house to?

150
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,020
No one.

151
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,860
You're here.

152
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,660
Let's have a meeting.

153
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,820
I've decided.

154
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,380
Give this house to Xiangdong for marriage.

155
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,780
I don't agree.

156
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,460
This meeting is unnecessary.

157
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,460
Grandma just mentioned it casually.

158
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,660
It was a whim.

159
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,260
Even if Xiangdong doesn't marry,

160
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,660
he shouldn't get this house.

161
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,340
You should discuss it further.

162
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,380
I'm leaving now.

163
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,380
Mom, don't listen to Grandma.

164
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,900
She didn't mean it seriously.

165
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,220
Dad left this house for you.

166
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,500
In the future,

167
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,700
we six siblings will divide it.

168
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,820
It has nothing to do with Xiangdong,

169
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,820
- right?
- What you said is correct.

170
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,220
Why talk about dividing the house?

171
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Your Grandma and I are still doing well.

172
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,100
- Yes.
- It's really unlucky.

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,140
No one said we would divide it.

174
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,860
Also,

175
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,300
in the future,

176
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,220
when Xiangdong gets married,

177
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,260
and has children,

178
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,460
they shouldn't take He as their surname.

179
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,220
Jianguo is the son-in-law for elder care,

180
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,460
but Xiangdong isn't.

181
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
They should get their surname Zhang.

182
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,300
Mom,

183
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,100
you're thinking way too far ahead.

184
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,700
If I don't think far,

185
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,020
who will think it for me?

186
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,300
Jiali!

187
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,980
Why are you so excited?

188
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,820
Where's Mom?

189
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,580
She's out at the stall, not back yet.

190
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,340
Xiaoling is back.

191
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
Xiaoling is back?

192
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,790
Where is she?

193
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
What are you doing, Jiali?

194
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
Mom,

195
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,500
Xiaoling is back.

196
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,940
Xiaoling is back?

197
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,580
She's not with me right now.

198
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,220
She's staying at
Guyuan International Hotel.

199
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,820
Staying at a hotel?

200
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,620
Why didn't she come home?

201
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,580
She said she'll join us for dinner.

202
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,180
Having dinner tonight?

203
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,180
You go to ask Jiawen, Jiayi, and Jiahuan

204
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,220
to come here, hurry up.

205
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,580
- Okay.
- Jiaxi, you

206
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,180
go get some deli meats.

207
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,220
Is all this really necessary?

208
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,820
Just go.

209
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,580
Hurry up! Buy enough.

210
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,420
Okay.

211
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,460
Xiaoling finally paid off the debt
and can come home.

212
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Mom, stop walking around.

213
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,580
You make me dizzy.

214
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,940
Go to the alley entrance,

215
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,420
and check why is she taking so long?

216
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,580
No need, Mom.

217
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
She can find her way home.

218
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,700
Whether I go or not,
she'll come back at the same time.

219
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,740
It's called "absence makes her fonder".

220
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,180
Let's disappear for a few years too.

221
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,420
Let's go to the South.

222
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,980
When we return, we'll be appreciated.

223
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,820
Don't be jealous.

224
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,460
I'm really jealous.

225
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,740
What are you jealous of?

226
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,700
It's good for her to be back,

227
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,540
right?

228
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,980
Mom, sit down and rest for a bit.

229
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,440
Save your energy, okay?

230
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,420
Grandma is up, too.

231
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,460
Okay.

232
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,180
Sit and rest, Mom.

233
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,020
What's wrong?

234
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,220
Fan put the word out.

235
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,700
What did he say?

236
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,100
He'll marry nobody but you.

237
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,060
Stop nonsense.

238
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,580
Who will marry him?

239
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,580
He said it himself.

240
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,580
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

241
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,100
He will never miss it.

242
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,180
He's unwavering.

243
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,980
He knows so many words?

244
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,420
I'm just saying it.

245
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,220
The key is he works at the Power Plant,

246
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,180
with a stable job and secure income.

247
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,460
How's Fang doing lately?

248
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,500
Go out and check.

249
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,700
Okay. I'm going, Mom, don't worry.

250
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,580
Look, I'm jogging out right now.

251
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,580
Don't worry, I'll check it out.

252
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
I'll wait here.

253
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,120
Mom!

254
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,340
She's back!

255
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,980
Mom, I'm back now.

256
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,340
Why are you crying?

257
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,580
You rarely call us all years.

258
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,340
I never know if you're doing okay.

259
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
She did call us,

260
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,580
but only to borrow money.

261
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,580
Mom, I'm doing just fine.

262
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,500
- You've lost weight.
- You're back.

263
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
Jiali.

264
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,500
Don't stand here.

265
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,340
Hurry inside.

266
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,460
Grandma is inside.

267
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,900
Wait a moment.

268
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,340
Come on in.

269
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,860
(Huang)

270
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,980
Let me introduce you.

271
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,580
This is my boyfriend Huang.

272
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
I'm new here.

273
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,500
Nice to meet you!

274
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
Don't just stand there,

275
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,180
come in. Huang, right?

276
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,020
Please, come in.

277
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,940
Let's go.

278
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,820
Please come in.

279
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Let me introduce you.

280
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,020
This is my Grandma.

281
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Hello.

282
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,340
Shouldn't the elders offer red envelopes?

283
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,560
This is the tradition in his hometown.

284
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,300
Please keep it, Grandma.

285
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,020
This is my Mom.

286
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,460
Hello.

287
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,540
Thank you.

288
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,900
This is Jiali.

289
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,180
Jiali.

290
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,420
I don't need it.

291
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,300
Just give it to the elders.

292
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,340
- No need.
- If you don't take it,

293
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,420
I'll keep it for you.

294
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,700
This is Jiayi.

295
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,620
Hello,

296
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,460
Jiayi.

297
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,420
This is Jiawen.

298
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,580
Jiawen.

299
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,420
It's a tradition?

300
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,320
Thank you.

301
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,540
This is Jiahuan.

302
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,340
- Jiahuan.
- Thank you.

303
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
This is Jiaxi,

304
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,420
my sixth younger sister.

305
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,540
Jiaxi.

306
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,540
Thank you, Huang.

307
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,580
Huang, how old are you?

308
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,340
I'm 39.

309
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Where are you from?

310
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,940
I'm living in Shenzhen.

311
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,100
You went to Shenzhen?

312
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,400
Yes.

313
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,580
Where did you meet

314
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,700
Xiaoling?

315
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,900
At the…

316
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,100
We always met at work,

317
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,180
and got to know each other.

318
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,740
Jiali, Mom,

319
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,580
stop asking so much.

320
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,820
You're making him nervous.

321
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,220
They'll come back again.

322
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Yeah, exactly.

323
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,180
Look at Xiaoling's style,

324
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,820
she must have made big money.

325
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,300
I'll treat all of you to dinner tomorrow.

326
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
Where shall we go?

327
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,980
Banquet Hall of Guyuan International Hotel.

328
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,340
Jiayi, Xiaoling is really making a fortune?

329
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,180
Absolutely.

330
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,820
She's giving red envelopes to everyone.

331
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,060
How did she make her money?

332
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,180
Forget it, let's not talk about it.

333
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,620
I'm in a hurry.

334
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,500
Why are you rushing?

335
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,580
Why am I rushing?

336
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,220
I have no money for the water bill.

337
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420
It's wrong.

338
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,820
Let me calculate it again.

339
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,180
Life is full of

340
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,220
ups and downs.

341
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,860
If I had ventured out,

342
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,820
I'd be rich now.

343
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
I'd come back and show off.

344
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,980
You only see her success.

345
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,460
Who knows what struggles she faced?

346
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,580
Didn't Jiayi mention

347
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,340
that even Xiaoling had tough times?

348
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,980
Only those who endure the most

349
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,100
become the highest.

350
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,620
Anyway, this life of mine

351
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,980
was wasted by your family.

352
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,340
Haven't you opened a shop?

353
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,580
You're a boss now.

354
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,580
But people here don't recognize value.

355
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Forget it.

356
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,980
The more I think,
the more I should venture out.

357
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
I should try to

358
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,220
be a trendsetter.

359
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,500
I should be fashionable.

360
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,820
You're trendy enough. Come on.

361
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,020
Let's sleep.

362
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,110
Yan Hongyu!

363
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,820
Could you wash your feet?

364
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,900
The smell is giving me a headache.

365
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,180
Even the trendiest place stinks now.

366
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
Go now.

367
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,180
What do you think of Huang?

368
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,180
Seems alright.

369
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,580
He said he's thirty-nine.

370
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I think he looks like he's over forty.

371
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,820
We can't check his ID, right?

372
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,820
I wonder what his family is like.

373
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm worried Xiaoling might suffer.

374
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,580
When she's away from home,

375
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,980
we can't look after her.

376
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,220
Xiaoling has faced troubles before,

377
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,220
she should have learned lessons.

378
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,860
Haven't you noticed her belly?

379
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,220
She still calls him her boyfriend.

380
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,580
You see that, too?

381
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,580
I hope she doesn't end like a hen,

382
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,340
laying one egg here, another there.

383
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,460
Stop nonsense.

384
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,540
Today,

385
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,780
it's just the beginning.

386
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,980
Tomorrow, I think
we'll get down to business.

387
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,220
(Blessings)
You should drink more, Ouyang.

388
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,140
Ouyang should drink more.

389
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,980
Really?

390
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,820
Have some dishes.

391
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,400
- Cheers!
- Good.

392
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,300
Come on.

393
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,540
Mom, have one.

394
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,980
Feng, take care of your sister.

395
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Hey, aren't you finishing this, Ouyang?

396
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,900
I'll tell you.

397
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,980
I need to toast others.

398
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,460
Say something.

399
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,340
Come on.

400
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,220
Let me say something.

401
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,900
I'm particularly happy

402
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,980
to see all of you today.

403
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Xiaoling said she has five sisters.

404
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,980
I was really surprised,

405
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,780
and a bit intimidated.

406
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,980
But today, I feel so warm when meeting you.

407
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,980
All of you are so unique and impressive.

408
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,220
Unique and impressive?

409
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,610
Huang, welcome!

410
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,460
Welcome!

411
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,780
- Cheers!
- Welcome!

412
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,300
Welcome, Huang!

413
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,700
Welcome!

414
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,220
Bottom up?

415
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,220
Don't drink too much.

416
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,060
Good.

417
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,860
Don't drink too much.

418
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,780
Drink as much as you like.

419
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,220
Back then,

420
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,800
when Xiaoling went to the South,

421
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,740
I was really worried.

422
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,060
She's alone and far from home,

423
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,460
I always worried about her,

424
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,220
hoping she wouldn't be in danger.

425
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,980
When I thought about it,

426
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,620
I couldn't sleep all night.

427
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,020
Mom is happy today.

428
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
Grandma.

429
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,020
Dear Mother.

430
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,220
Dear Mother?

431
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,540
This time, Xiaoling and I came back

432
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,220
to settle things,

433
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,060
get married,

434
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,420
and grow old together.

435
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,060
Well,

436
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,620
Huang, this isn't trendy now.

437
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,980
Get up, quickly!

438
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,900
Help yourself.

439
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,860
Okay.

440
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,540
Jiali,

441
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,140
I toast to you.

442
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,460
Thank you.

443
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,620
Huang,

444
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,220
since you're here today,

445
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,140
I will speak what I should clearly.

446
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,780
In our hometown,

447
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,620
marriage follows rules and procedures.

448
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,740
I see.

449
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,460
Life is like business,

450
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,980
we have to follow the rules.

451
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,980
Take a seat here.

452
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,220
I'll have a word with you.

453
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,700
It's a business now.

454
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,980
Xiaoling has told me

455
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,700
your situation.

456
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,740
Both of you have been married before.

457
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,220
Today's gathering

458
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,900
can be considered the procedures.

459
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,460
We don't need extravagance.

460
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,740
Let's be practical.

461
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,620
You're right.

462
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,740
Since you've decided to be together,

463
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,260
you need a house.

464
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,780
I have a house in Longgang, Shenzhen.

465
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,900
Yes, in Shenzhen.

466
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,780
His hometown.

467
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,700
- Yes.
- It's in Shenzhen.

468
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,620
You need one here, too.

469
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,460
Right.

470
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,780
You mean…

471
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,220
It's our custom here.

472
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,020
So that when you return,

473
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,660
you have a place to stay.

474
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,660
All of us have our own houses,

475
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,700
except for Xiaoling.

476
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,020
It makes her feel a bit left out.

477
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,740
I understand.

478
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,420
I see there are many rooms at home.

479
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,980
The house

480
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,460
will be left to whoever
takes care of their Mom.

481
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,460
Grandma, I didn't say I wanted it.

482
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,420
If you want to take care of your Mom,
you can get it.

483
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,180
Jiali will take care of our Mom.

484
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,900
It's no rush to buy a house.

485
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,780
Think it over again.

486
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,780
But Xiaoling can't wait now.

487
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,980
- Well…
- She can wait.

488
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,420
After dinner, let's find Jianguo.

489
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
He's on duty today.

490
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,420
He can show us around to see houses.

491
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,660
Alright, let's eat first.

492
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,700
- Okay.
- Let's go.

493
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,220
Huang, don't leave.

494
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,580
Ouyang, cheers.

495
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,540
Welcome!

496
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,900
It's quite spacious.

497
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,380
This is the kitchen.

498
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,780
The kitchen is a bit small.

499
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,180
But it's well-equipped.

500
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,140
Three bedrooms.

501
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
One, two, three rooms.

502
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
If we had a place like this,

503
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,140
it would be nice,

504
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,460
right?

505
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,180
We could live with the kids.

506
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,700
Which kids want to live with you?

507
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,420
By the way, the owner of this house

508
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,940
is a friend of my comrade.

509
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,500
He went to the South for work,

510
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,780
and wanted to sell this house.

511
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,820
And it's on the first floor.

512
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,260
What do you think?

513
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,460
Three bedrooms, two living rooms.

514
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,980
Isn't it a bit too big?

515
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,500
Big or not, it's the same price.

516
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,940
In this area, you can get this house
at this price,

517
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,420
you're getting a great deal.

518
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,300
What do you think?

519
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,140
What about you?

520
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,220
I think it's great.

521
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,940
Great.

522
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,900
Let's take it.

523
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,540
(Tang Yangyang)

524
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,420
This is good now.

525
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,740
The house will have only your name.

526
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,260
If not for you, but for Yangyang.

527
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,300
Alright.

528
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,420
Jiali, I'm back.

529
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,340
Does the Tang family know it?

530
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
They should know.

531
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,180
I had a chat with Qiufang yesterday.

532
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,620
And then?

533
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,740
You know about last time.

534
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,060
You called home,

535
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,940
and the child ran off without a word.

536
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,740
We almost called the police.

537
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,380
I guess Qiufang and the others

538
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,140
are worried he'll get upset.

539
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,780
After all, Yangyang is very sensitive.

540
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,620
Yes.

541
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm just afraid once I leave…

542
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,700
I understand what you mean.

543
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,780
But it's a bit late today.

544
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,780
Let's do it tomorrow.

545
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,460
I'll try to arrange your meeting
with the child.

546
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,220
Alright.

547
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,540
But you need to be mentally prepared.

548
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,340
I understand.

549
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
I know Yangyang blames me,

550
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,940
but I'm just afraid that

551
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,420
once this baby is born,

552
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,640
he'll find it even harder to accept me.

553
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,780
I'll try to make you meet.

554
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,700
Jiali, don't wait until tomorrow.

555
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,540
Let's do it now.

556
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
Now?

557
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,980
Alright.

558
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,940
I'll head over and try.

559
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,940
Youmin, it's your turn.

560
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,700
- Hit.
- Wait a moment.

561
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,650
Three.

562
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,790
Three threes.

563
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,780
Three Ks.

564
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,980
Suppress.

565
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,920
Four twos.

566
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,900
Jiali.

567
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,460
Zhenmin, can I have a word with you?

568
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,340
He Jiali,

569
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,060
do you have something to hide?

570
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,940
Can't you say it in front of all of us?

571
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,780
Youmin!

572
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,980
Jiali,

573
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,980
just say it directly.

574
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,020
It's okay.

575
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,060
Xiaoling is back.

576
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,780
It's none of my business.

577
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,460
You were a couple before.

578
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,220
Even though it's over,

579
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,300
you're still friends, right?

580
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,540
Jiali,

581
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,940
did you come here just to say that?

582
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
She wants to see Yangyang.

583
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,820
No way.

584
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Why should you decide everything?

585
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,140
Weren't you the ones who abandoned him?

586
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,260
Speak properly.

587
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,220
No matter how unpleasant we were
in the past,

588
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,700
we should respect

589
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
one undeniable fact that

590
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,980
Xiaoling is Yangyang's biological mom.

591
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,740
Yangyang was born by Xiaoling.

592
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,500
What's the point of this?

593
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,940
Xiaoling had no choice but to leave,

594
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,260
but she didn't abandon the child.

595
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,220
Did she really care?

596
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,940
How did she care?

597
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,180
Did she offer help or money?

598
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,380
Lixia,

599
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,140
(Lixia)
take your husband inside.

600
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,860
Go inside.

601
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,970
Stop talking.

602
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,500
Why go inside?

603
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,900
I get annoyed just seeing their family.

604
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,220
Let's go home!

605
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,380
Are you crazy?

606
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,500
Ignore him.

607
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,780
Sit and talk.

608
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,140
Zhenmin,

609
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,780
have a good talk with Jiali.

610
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,580
Zhenmin.

611
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,540
No way.

612
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,500
Xiaoling hasn't neglected Yangyang.

613
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,660
Once her financial situation was better,

614
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,700
she sent money back every month.

615
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,820
Jiali,

616
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,060
it's not about the money.

617
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,700
I understand you.

618
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,500
It's difficult for you alone
to raise a child.

619
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,300
But Xiaoling wants to help too.

620
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,380
When you two broke up,

621
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,420
she didn't ask for anything,

622
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,460
except the child.

623
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,180
But over these years,

624
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,700
she's faced storms alone outside.

625
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,940
We can imagine her hardships.

626
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,460
But she was far away,

627
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
no one could help her,

628
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
take care of her.

629
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,940
She had to rely on herself.

630
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,500
Sometimes she even had no money
to buy food,

631
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,700
calling Jiayi for money.

632
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,620
She deserved it.

633
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,660
It wasn't easy for her
to come back this time.

634
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,700
She just wants to see the child.

635
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,620
She doesn't have any other intentions.

636
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
She told me that

637
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,940
she wants to make it up
to the child in the future.

638
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Zhenmin,

639
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,140
just see this as an act of kindness.

640
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,700
No woman wouldn't care for her child.

641
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,540
Xiaoling really had no other choice.

642
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,980
Just give her a few minutes.

643
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,820
Let her take a look.

644
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,900
Yangyang,

645
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,500
come with me. Let's go home.

646
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,700
Your Mom is back.

647
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Don't you miss your Mom?

648
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,780
I don't have a Mom.

649
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm really happy for Xiaoling.

650
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,420
It's not easy being alone outside.

651
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,900
It's good for her to find someone

652
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,740
and start a family.

653
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,180
This will be more secure.

654
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,700
Xiaoling even bought a house this time.

655
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,340
Right here?

656
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,620
She has a house outside,

657
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,460
but she needs one here, too.

658
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,780
In the future, this house will

659
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,900
be given to Yangyang.

660
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,740
Jiali,

661
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,700
I heard about what happened last night.

662
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,140
You can't entirely blame Zhenmin for it.

663
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,980
Yangyang didn't want to go.

664
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,740
You know what happened before.

665
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,940
You can't force anyone to do anything

666
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
they don't want to do.

667
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,420
Yangyang

668
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,460
seems quiet,

669
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,740
but he's stubborn.

670
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,140
A child at his age
should have his own ideas.

671
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,540
Yes.

672
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,460
I know, and I understand.

673
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,220
That's why I come to you
to find a solution.

674
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,980
What solution?

675
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,700
Xiaoling wants to see her son.

676
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,500
Let's arrange it for her.

677
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,140
I'm leaving.

678
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,300
You promised not to cry.

679
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,140
I'm not crying.

680
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
I'm not.

681
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,300
Things are getting better.

682
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,260
It won't be tougher than before.

683
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,060
When the baby is born,

684
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,700
call me,

685
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,700
and let us know.

686
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,900
Of course.

687
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,740
Get in the car.

688
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,700
I'll rent out your house.

689
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,220
The rent will be transferred
to your account.

690
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,740
Thank you, Jiali.

691
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,700
I trust you to handle it.

692
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,490
Huang,

693
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,060
is it safe for her

694
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,460
to fly?

695
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,300
Yes, it's safe.

696
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,380
Xiaoling is a priority now.

697
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,540
I'll take care of her.

698
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,380
Alright.

699
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,900
Take care of yourself.

700
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,980
Xiaoling,

701
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,700
be cautious out there.

702
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,500
Mr. Huang,

703
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,860
remember to invest in Huainan
when you can.

704
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,780
Sure.

705
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,900
Huang,

706
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,700
since our family isn't nearby,

707
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,460
if you ever bully Xiaoling,

708
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,220
we'll come over directly.

709
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,900
I'll follow your order.

710
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,900
Huang, she's counting on you.

711
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,980
Don't worry.

712
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,020
Xiaoling, let me know when the baby is born.

713
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,220
I'll come to visit you.

714
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,740
I've never been to Shenzhen.

715
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,700
Call me anytime.

716
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,140
Alright, let's go.

717
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,660
Alright, stop looking.

718
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,980
The airport is far in Hefei. Let's go.

719
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,500
Be careful.

720
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,140
Jiali, get in the car.

721
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,380
Safe travels.

722
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,700
Drive slowly, Hongyu.

723
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
(Hefei)

724
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,460
Passengers on Flight CZ5368 to Shenzhen,

725
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,500
(Security Check)
attention please,

726
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,260
those who have checked in

727
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
but haven't cleared security,

728
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,460
please proceed to security check quickly,

729
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,940
and wait in the departure lounge.

730
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,780
Thank you.

731
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,540
Let's go.

732
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,220
We're running out of time.

733
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,540
Xiaoling.

734
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Go now, don't miss the flight.

735
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,140
- Go now.
- Xiaoling.

736
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,180
I'm leaving, Jiali.

737
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Alright, go ahead.

738
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,300
Take care of yourself.

739
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,380
Goodbye, Jiali.

740
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,460
Take care of Xiaoling!

741
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,060
Yangyang.

742
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,340
Jiali!

743
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,300
- Qiufang!
- Jiali!

744
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,180
- Where is she?
- Missed her again.

745
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,380
Liu Xiaoling!

746
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,220
Xiaoling!

747
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,460
Liu Xiaoling!

748
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,300
Xiaoling!

749
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,540
Yangyang, call Mom!

750
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,380
Yangyang.

751
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,620
Mom!

752
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,140
(Welcome to Baoyi Bath)

753
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,380
No one is left now?

754
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,860
Yes. I'll change the water soon.

755
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,780
Let's take a break.

756
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
With this weather,

757
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,980
at this hour, no one's here.

758
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,540
The Dazaotou Bath does well.

759
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,780
We have different business styles.

760
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,500
(Open)
It offers a sauna.

761
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,820
We offer a regular bath.

762
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,340
What's wrong with a sauna?

763
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,500
Don't we have a sauna house?

764
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,940
It has female attendants

765
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,980
and performances.

766
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,780
We can't do that.

767
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,100
Let's keep steady and sustainable.

768
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,340
We might go bankrupt in six months.

769
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,580
I just don't understand

770
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,940
why Dazaotou

771
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,500
sounds like a restaurant,

772
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,900
but it's a bathhouse

773
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,140
and its business is well.

774
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,620
Honey,

775
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,660
how about we change our name?

776
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,780
- To what?
- Something catchy,

777
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,260
and popular.

778
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,740
Something catchy,

779
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,420
catchy,

780
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,140
and popular.

781
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,340
Baoyi Bath,

782
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,140
Dazaotou Bath,

783
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,500
I think

784
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,820
we'd better make an exotic name,

785
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,140
like Big Tycoon Bath?

786
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Is it exotic?

787
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,140
It sounds tacky.

788
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,580
Forget it, stop worrying.

789
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,460
Today is a great day.

790
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,300
I think

791
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,980
we should be happy.

792
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,820
What's so special today?

793
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,900
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

794
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,020
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

795
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,420
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

796
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,380
(Happy Birthday)
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

797
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,340
I forgot about it.

798
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,100
Yeah? I remember it. Come.

799
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,340
Candle.

800
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
One is enough.

801
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,340
Now, I'm afraid of birthdays.

802
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,580
Alright.

803
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,180
Let's just use one candle.

804
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,820
Come on.

805
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,460
Let's blow out the candle.

806
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,980
Make a wish first.

807
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,980
Once you're done, you can blow it out.

808
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,580
It doesn't cost much, all from work.

809
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,460
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

810
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,100
Mom, is dinner ready?

811
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,940
Guangming.

812
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,780
This is my son, Guangming.

813
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,980
Hello, Guangming,

814
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,340
I'm your mother's friend.

815
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,700
Uncle Fan.

816
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,980
I won't keep you for dinner.

817
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,020
Okay. I...

818
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,940
won't stay. Well,

819
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,940
He's tall.

820
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,980
- I…
- There,

821
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,940
- I'm leaving.
- Take care!

822
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,820
Why not greet him?

823
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,100
Are you hungry?

824
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,100
Wash your hands, and eat.

825
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
Mom,

826
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,620
did Jiali tell you?

827
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,460
Is Xiaoling's house settled?

828
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,860
It sounds so.

829
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,580
I heard it's all settled.

830
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,460
So, what's next?

831
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,300
Rent it out,

832
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,180
or leave it empty?

833
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,580
You should ask Jiali.

834
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,980
Why, do you have any ideas?

835
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,180
Mom, look,

836
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,580
I have to pay rent for my shop

837
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,420
and the house.

838
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,900
I have to pay rent to
whoever rents me a house.

839
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,660
Why not move into Xiaoling's house

840
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,060
and pay her rent.

841
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,780
I wonder if Xiaoling agrees.

842
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,420
Xiaoling lives so far away.

843
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,980
Is it all decided by Jiali?

844
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,980
Anyway, if I move in,

845
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,620
Mom, you can live with me.

846
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,780
I'll take care of you.

847
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,100
We live together,

848
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,420
lively and cheerful,

849
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,300
wouldn't that be great?

850
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,980
Haven't you had enough with Jiali?

851
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,980
Look at what she feeds you,

852
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,420
carrots and homemade pickles.

853
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,780
The rice porridge

854
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,900
hardly contains any rice.

855
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,260
And the sweet potatoes,

856
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,860
don't you feel bloated eating them?

857
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,300
How many days a week can you eat meat?

858
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,060
If I move out with you,

859
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,020
it's not appropriate.

860
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,660
Your Grandma is still here.

861
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,420
Jiali will take care of her.

862
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,660
The two of them

863
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,580
live here for such a long time

864
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,820
and don't pay rent,

865
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,030
shouldn't they contribute something?

866
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,140
Jiaxi, you are here.

867
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,660
Jiali, you're back.

868
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,740
Mom, I am leaving now.

869
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,660
The shop needs to open.

870
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,260
Have some watermelon before you go.

871
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,180
No, thanks, Jiali.

872
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,580
I want to ask you something.

873
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
What's that?

874
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,620
How's Xiaoling's house?

875
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,980
It's almost settled.

876
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,580
What are your plans for it?

877
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,420
Rent it out.

878
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,460
I'll rent it.

879
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,540
Why?

880
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,780
Well, I was thinking...

881
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,660
I've been staying here all the time,

882
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,380
I need a change of scenery.

883
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,660
Was it Jiaxi's idea?

884
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,420
Honestly speaking,

885
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,460
I planned to take Jiaxi in.

886
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,980
Are you taking her in,

887
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,180
or is she taking you in?

888
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,580
Or she wants to use your name,

889
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,540
and stay in Xiaoling's house?

890
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,540
I said it's rented. I'll pay the rent.

891
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,500
Xiaoling's rent

892
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,580
is her extra salary.

893
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,380
It's a subsidy for Yangyang.

894
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,580
No disputes allowed.

895
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,180
If Jiaxi lives there,

896
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,980
should I charge her rent?

897
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,820
Of course you should.

898
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,980
But what if she can't pay one day?

899
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,140
Can I kick her out?

900
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,460
Jiali,

901
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,860
Jiaxi

902
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,180
is really struggling right now.

903
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,660
Her store

904
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,300
loses money every month
and she still needs to pay rent.

905
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,380
Xiaoling's house is bigger.

906
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,460
If she pays rent,

907
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,020
she'll have to pay more.

908
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,540
Alright, you talk to Jiaxi later.

909
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,820
No problem. I'll talk to her.

910
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,020
Mom, please stay out of this.

911
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,140
Xiaoling is already struggling enough.

912
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,740
Don't try to take advantage of her.

913
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,820
No,

914
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,580
we worked hard to

915
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,420
help Liu Xiaoling get this house.

916
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,820
I, as her Mom, want to stay a few days.

917
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,820
Is that a problem?

918
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,580
No. You can stay,

919
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,780
but it's not suitable for Jiaxi.

920
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,820
Jiali,

921
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,420
it's been a week already,

922
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,540
we don't eat meat.

923
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,180
Grandma said she couldn't chew meat.

924
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,860
It gets stuck and is hard to digest.

925
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,580
Would you like some Pork Floss?

926
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,180
I want to eat Pork Belly.

927
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,980
Hello?

928
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,980
Hongyu, is Jiaxi there?

929
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,820
Yes, she's.

930
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,260
Jiaxi, it's a call for you.

931
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,020
Who is it?

932
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,900
Jiali.

933
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,900
Jiaxi,

934
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
what a coincidence,

935
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,860
Xiaoling's house was rented yesterday.

936
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,980
The contract was already signed.

937
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,940
No worries, Jiali.

938
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,340
I was just asking casually.

939
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,500
No worries.

940
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,580
