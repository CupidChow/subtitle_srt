00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,910
Hello.

17
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,630
He, someone's looking for you.

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,230
Are you He Changsheng?

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
I am.

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Hello.

21
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,630
We're here today to ask you something.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
Have a seat.

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,230
Someone reported Tang Dahu.

24
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,200
Tell us everything you know.

25
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,110
I'm close to Comrade Tang Dahu.

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
What's the matter?

28
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,320
He,

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
thank you.

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,440
No need.

31
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,040
I was just telling the truth.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,740
He.

Thank you.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,670
Dad.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
You're here.

37
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,550
Actually,

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,790
some things I did

39
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,880
went too far.

40
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,110
Even...

41
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,160
What's wrong with you today?

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,790
Every time I see your leg,

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
I feel especially bad inside.

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,760
It was my interference back then

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,350
that stopped you and Jiali,

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,390
which caused your leg...

47
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,670
Dad,

48
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,040
don't say that.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,390
Now,

50
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,450
I'm doing well with Qiufang.

51
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,350
And,

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,390
when I was younger,
I liked to cause trouble,

53
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,190
but now,

54
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,200
I just want to live a peaceful life.

55
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,790
Yes.

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,520
Let's look forward.

57
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,480
Just like the water of the Huai River,

58
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,480
flowing forward.

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,870
It can't flow backward.

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,920
Actually,

61
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,870
after going through these things,

62
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
I think the He Family

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,110
is quite a decent family.

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,190
When the organization
came to investigate me,

65
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,280
Mr. He didn't speak ill of me

66
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,280
but instead spoke many good things.

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Dad,

68
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,110
have you grown?

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,110
Yes, I've grown.

70
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,190
Aren't you grown too?

71
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
Alright.

72
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,400
You stay here.

73
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll go

74
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,670
and see my granddaughter.

75
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,790
1977 Guidelines

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,670
for College Admissions.

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,040
Workers, peasants, educated youth

78
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,430
who went to the countryside
and returned to their hometown,

79
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,400
demobilized soldiers, cadres,

80
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,520
and high school graduates

81
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,230
who meet the criteria can apply.

82
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
Jiawen, you can apply.

83
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,640
- Me?
- The Gaokao is finally back.

84
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,940
Jiawen, will you take it?

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,870
I haven't thought about it yet.

86
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,080
People need to be practical.

87
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,230
Just find a stable job, right?

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,430
After you pass the Gaokao

89
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,840
and finish school,

90
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,600
you'll still be looking for a job.

91
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,790
Ms. Liu said Qiufang has signed up.

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,940
Qiufang wants to take the exam?

93
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,790
How could she take it?

94
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,990
She has a family.

95
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,670
She can't just ignore

96
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,640
her family and daughter.

97
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,840
Ms. Liu said

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,920
she wants to study medicine,

99
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,790
so she can take care of Weimin.

100
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,990
Jiali, will you take it?

101
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,790
Are you joking?

102
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,550
I have to take care of my son,

103
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,790
and my sisters are still young.

104
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,080
Someone has to stay at home.

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,870
But Jiawen,

106
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,480
you can give it a try.

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,650
I...

108
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Gaokao

109
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,110
isn't something anyone can pass.

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,670
It's hard.

111
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Jiawen,

112
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,990
I saw Qiufang studying this,

113
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,040
so I found a way to get you a copy.

114
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,670
(Physics)
Jiali, I haven't made up my mind yet.

115
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,840
It's always good to learn more.

116
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,040
It'd be better to start working earlier

117
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,430
and lighten the family's burden.

118
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,190
I'm home with your brother-in-law.

119
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,920
Also, it's not as hard as before.

120
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,040
We're not waiting for you to make money.

121
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,080
While you're young,

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,870
the more you can learn, the better.

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,280
Now, the Gaokao
has finally been restored.

124
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,400
This is an opportunity.

125
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,080
Does Qiufang really want
to take the exam?

126
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
It seems like she's made up her mind.

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
You should do it too.

128
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,190
People should know their limits.

129
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,310
I'd be fine joining the army.

130
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,960
Forget about the Gaokao.

131
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,480
I won't be able to focus.

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,670
Besides, I have
a big family to look after.

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
You're different.

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,190
You're young with a sharp mind.

135
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,110
(Physics)
If you study hard,

136
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,140
you'll definitely make it.

137
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,840
Just remember one thing.

138
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,530
A wide range of skills will never hurt.

139
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
What's going on?

140
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,350
Did Dad talk to you?

141
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,510
No.

142
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,870
Then hurry up and make your move.

143
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,630
Jiali.

144
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,220
Come here.

145
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,180
(Physics)

146
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,720
Don't keep pushing Jiawen
to take the Gaokao.

147
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,070
Mom, you don't understand
the situation now.

148
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,190
What situation?

149
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,310
Zhang Qiufang is taking the exam,

150
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,830
so Jiawen has to take it too?

151
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,120
That's just following the crowd.

152
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,040
Have you considered how many people
are in Ms. Liu's family

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
and how many are in ours?

154
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,790
Jiawen should find a job

155
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,520
and start earning money.
That's the best choice.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,470
Mom, but this opportunity is too rare.

157
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,000
There hasn't been a Gaokao for years.

158
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Let me tell you.

159
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,590
This is basically
like the imperial exam.

160
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,550
If you pass,

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,040
it's like becoming a scholar.

162
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,480
A female scholar?

163
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,770
What's the use of that?

164
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,670
Mom, your thinking is outdated.

165
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,120
Men and women are equal now.

166
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,190
Then why don't you take the exam?

167
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,430
Because I didn't inherit Dad's high IQ.

168
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
I only inherited yours.

169
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,020
What do you mean?

170
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
Mom, just stay out of this.

171
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,590
I won't interfere, but your dad will.

172
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,790
What's he going to do?

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
He's helping Jiawen find a job.

174
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,640
We're just worried

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,790
that you'd be under too much pressure.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,160
Don't worry. I can handle it.

177
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,500
Even if there are difficulties,

178
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,670
we have to overcome them.

179
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,790
Mom,

180
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,470
I'm not just thinking about Jiawen.

181
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,790
I'm thinking about our whole family.

182
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,470
Think about it.

183
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,790
Some of us work,

184
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,190
some study,

185
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,360
and the younger ones
will each have their own path.

186
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,600
Make full use of everything,

187
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,190
and let everyone reach their potential,

188
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,550
so our family can grow stronger.

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,000
Then having six kids
won't be for nothing.

190
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,360
Having a college graduate
would be great. Just imagine.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
- I'm back.
- Dad.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Come here, come here.

193
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,190
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

194
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,030
Sit down.

195
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,010
Let me tell you.

196
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,080
What's going on?

197
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,040
Jiawen taking the Gaokao.

198
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,280
Who? Jiawen?

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
Wasn't she not taking it?

200
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,790
She's taking it. I've convinced her.

201
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,190
I went through all this trouble
to find someone

202
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,190
to arrange a job for her.
Everything was set,

203
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,590
and now she wants to take the exam?

204
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,830
Can she even pass?

205
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,790
She can try.

206
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,400
What if she actually passes?

207
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,000
If she passes, of course, she'll go.

208
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,530
Why wouldn't she go if she passes?

209
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,160
Let's just give it a try.
Let her pass first.

210
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,120
Dad.

211
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,190
You still don't get it?

212
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,830
This means he agrees.

213
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,000
Alright. If she passes,
she goes to college.

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,160
If she doesn't, she gets a job.

215
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,670
Fine.

216
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,910
Pinky promise.

217
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,700
You're an adult now.

218
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,070
- It's childish.
- Pinky promise.

219
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,910
Pinky promise.

220
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,280
You make a pinky promise;

221
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,790
you keep it all your life.

222
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,430
Or I'll throw you on the ice.

223
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,550
Look at your daughter.

224
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,830
If she's taking the exam,
she has to be serious.

225
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,760
Starting tomorrow,

226
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,490
don't make Jiawen do this or that.

227
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,070
The whole family should support her.

228
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,910
Let's go all in.

229
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,000
Why are you worried
about something good?

230
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,790
If she really passes,

231
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,040
she'll leave.

232
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
Dad,

233
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,070
broaden your perspective.

234
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,670
Ouyang Bao,

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,740
why are you here?

236
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,870
(Ouyang Bao)
Jiayi, we planned to go eat beef soup.

237
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,040
Shh, I want to cancel it.

238
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
Go away.

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,870
Why cancel it?

240
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,300
I just don't want to go.

241
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,670
- Didn't you want beef soup?
- Go.

242
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,860
I don't want it anymore. Go.

243
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,280
Hello, Mr. He.

244
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,160
Why are you bullying a girl?

245
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,240
I didn't.

246
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,550
Come on, eat.

247
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,150
I've eaten.

248
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,360
Have some more.

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
Alright.

250
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Where do you live?

251
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,550
South Market.

252
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,790
Not far.

253
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,670
What do your parents do?

254
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,520
My mom passed away.

255
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,040
My dad is a worker.

256
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,360
How many siblings do you have?

257
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
Ten brothers.

258
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,550
Ten? All brothers?

259
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,920
Are they all

260
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,950
from the same father and mother?

261
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,520
I guess so.

262
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,760
Dad, stop interrogating him.

263
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,040
Your dad is impressive.

264
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,280
Obey orders, and follow commands.

265
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,310
You just don't get it.

266
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,000
I didn't hear from you,

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
so I got a little anxious.

268
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,640
What am I to you?

269
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,830
And what are you to me?

270
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,670
Jiayi,

271
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
I'll listen to you anyway.

272
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,360
Don't ever come to my house
without my permission.

273
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,190
This must never happen again.

274
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,670
Understood.

275
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,220
(Welcome candidates
of the 1977 Gaokao to our school)

276
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,340
(Admission Ticket, Zhang Qiufang)

277
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,510
Jiawen.

278
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
Jiali.

279
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,400
How was it?

280
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,190
Not bad.

281
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,280
Did you answer everything?

282
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
More or less.

283
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,520
Let's go eat out.

284
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,830
Jiali, no need.

285
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,390
Let's go home.

286
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,260
(One month later)

287
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,040
Slow down.

288
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,190
Letter for Zhang Qiufang,
No. 13 Beitou Alley.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Here, your letter.

290
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,630
Thanks.

291
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,860
(To: Zhang Qiufang)

292
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,060
(Zhang Qiulin)

293
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,920
Mom, Mom!

294
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,670
- What?
- It's from the medical school!

295
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,020
A letter from the medical school?

296
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,260
(College Admission Notice)

297
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,190
Your sister got in!

298
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,880
She got in!

299
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,310
Jiawen, you barely answered
any of these questions.

300
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,520
You only read
the beginning of this book.

301
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,310
I didn't have time, Jiali.

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This isn't for others.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,190
It's for yourself.

304
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,710
Did you really give it your all?

305
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,120
I did my best.

306
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,160
Your best?
You were just 0.5 points short.

307
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,710
Next year, put in more effort,

308
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,710
and you'll make it.

309
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm not taking it again.

310
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,630
Why?

311
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,160
Dad already arranged a job

312
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,280
in the Grain Bureau's Starch Factory.

313
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
I'm just waiting to start.

314
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,120
But you're still so young.

315
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,760
Jiali, stop.

316
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,920
I know you mean well,

317
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,760
but I've experienced the Gaokao.

318
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,390
I don't regret it,

319
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,550
and I can accept this result.

320
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,310
Try harder

321
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,760
and take it again next year.

322
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,160
I'll support you.

323
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,710
I'm not taking it, Jiali.

324
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,920
I think

325
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,670
you've worked hard all these years.

326
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,710
It's time I start helping out.

327
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,320
Let's work together

328
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,270
and take good care of this family.

329
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,180
(April 1980)

330
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,660
(He Jiawe, He'second daughter)

331
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,380
(He Jiayi, He's third daughter)

332
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,270
Jiayi.

333
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,990
I have good news for you.

334
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,960
Go on.

335
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,910
(Ouyang Bao)
I officially started working.

336
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,370
What's that got to do with me?

337
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,190
Aren't you happy for me?

338
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,320
A formal employee at the cooperative

339
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,800
of the Foreign Trade Bureau.

340
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,120
I'll give you my salary next month.

341
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,310
Ouyang Bao.

342
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,430
You can say that to me,

343
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,950
but don't say it to others.

344
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,360
- OK.
- What am I to you?

345
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,120
And what are you to me?

346
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,990
Why would you give me your salary?

347
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
You have

348
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,950
a whole bunch of brothers to support.

349
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,670
Saying things like this
will ruin my reputation.

350
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,400
That's not what I meant.

351
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,230
I'm not good with words.

352
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,360
But you know what I mean.

353
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,880
Everything I have is yours,

354
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,360
and I'll give you anything you want.

355
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,120
If I wanted your life,
would you give me?

356
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,480
I would.

357
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,920
Even if so, I wouldn't take it.

358
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,540
I...

359
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,100
(Seek truth)
I'll give you it anyway.

360
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,920
Even though we have six daughters,

361
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,190
as long as you all stick together,

362
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,670
no one will dare to bully us.

363
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,750
Dad, times have changed.

364
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,990
No one bullies us anymore.

365
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,750
How many eras have you lived through?

366
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,120
You don't know about the old society.

367
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,510
Forget it, not worth mentioning.

368
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,470
Anyway, you all need to remember

369
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,890
your hardships
and appreciate what you have.

370
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,500
(He Jiahuan, He's fourth daughter)
You don't know how lucky you are.

371
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,120
(Liu Xiaolin, He's fifth daughter)

372
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,960
Right?

373
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,310
Dad,

374
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,190
I'm about to graduate too.

375
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,710
I don't plan to go to college.

376
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,710
You need to help me find a job.

377
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,990
Even if Dad doesn't help you,

378
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,990
Jianguo and I won't leave you hanging.

379
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,590
Jiali,

380
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,950
you said it.

381
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,360
I want to work somewhere artistic.

382
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,080
(He Jiawe, He's second daughter)

383
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,190
Then you should learn from Qiufang

384
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,710
and go to college.

385
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,160
Maybe

386
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
an art school.

387
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,320
It's too late.
I wasn't trained from a young age.

388
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,360
Singing? No good voice.

389
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,510
Acting? No good looks.

390
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,080
Dancing? No good posture.

391
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,710
At least you know yourself.

392
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,800
You scar-face.

393
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
Apologize.

394
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,080
- Sorry.
- Louder.

395
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,760
Jiahuan.

396
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,600
I said something wrong. I'm sorry.

397
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,750
Alright, she apologized. Let's eat.

398
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,000
Eat.

399
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
We're family.

400
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,360
No matter what,

401
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,710
you six sisters

402
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,710
must always remember

403
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,190
you share the same parents.

404
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,110
Right?

405
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,360
What's that saying?

406
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,710
A harmonious family prospers, right?

407
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,880
If you all stick together,

408
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
this family will thrive.

409
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Got it?

410
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,960
Jiawen,

411
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,270
you've been working for a while now.

412
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,120
Still not thinking about dating?

413
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,990
Haven't met the right person.

414
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,190
So many introductions.

415
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,990
Not a single one was right?

416
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,640
I don't believe it.

417
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,950
I think your standards are too high.

418
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,510
What exactly do you mean by that?

419
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,230
A good family background.

420
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,560
Handsome.

421
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,950
Capable.

422
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,800
Outstanding in every way.

423
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,710
What are your criteria?

424
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,560
Just someone decent.

425
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,750
Looks pleasant enough.

426
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,960
Reliable.

427
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,120
Most importantly,

428
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,160
someone who knows how to build a life.

429
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,540
I wouldn't approve of him,

430
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,470
let alone Jiawen.

431
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,950
How can they find these people for her?

432
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,270
Don't say that.

433
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,230
What if Jiawen likes one of them?

434
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,470
Impossible.

435
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,190
And those from the power plant,

436
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,030
the rubber factory...

437
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,800
So many came knocking.

438
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,840
She didn't like a single one.

439
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,640
You should talk to her.

440
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,640
Tell her not to aim so high.

441
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,920
It's not like the Jade Emperor's son

442
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,400
is going to show up at our door.

443
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,600
She needs to be realistic.

444
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,840
So many people coming with proposals.

445
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,800
What does that mean?

446
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
It means our daughter is outstanding,

447
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,030
and she has the right to choose.

448
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,990
Let her look around

449
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,840
and wait.

450
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,430
No more waiting.

451
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
She's not getting any younger.

452
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,600
In the end,

453
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,400
she might pick herself into a corner.

454
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,030
Alright, I'll talk to her.

455
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,030
She should pick

456
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,600
the best one among them

457
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,430
and start dating, right?

458
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,600
Give it a try.

459
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,190
He might turn out to be a great match.

460
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,230
Exactly.

461
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,670
Better than ending up with nothing.

462
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,510
Yes.

463
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,020
(1980 Grain Bureau Employee Sports Meet)

464
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,990
Hurry. Shoot!

465

466
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,270
We lost. Why are you clapping?

(Feed Company: 65)

469
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Ms. Guo, who was that guy
who just made the shot?

470
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,920
Chen Weiguo from the Feed Company.

471
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,430
I'm neighbors with his sister.

472
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,960
He's a good player.

473
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,120
Weiguo!

474
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,360
Weiguo!

475
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,190
What's up, Ms. Guo?

476
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,120
Why didn't you visit your sister?

477
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,950
I'm asking you.

478
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,360
I've been too busy to go.

479
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,800
This is our factory beauty, He Jiawen.

480
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm Chen Weiguo,

481
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,750
from the Feed Company, Grain Bureau.

482
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,430
I'm 26, single.

483
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,400
Hello, Chen Weiguo.

484
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,190
I'm He Jiawen

485
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
from the Starch Factory.

486
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,750
I'm single too.

487
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,680
That's good.

488
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,720
He,

489
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,750
you should

490
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,640
think this over.

491
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,950
Talk about it with your wife.

492
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,030
The guy is solid

493
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,460
and has a good family background.

494
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,350
- Sure.
- Right?

495
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,800
Settle this sooner,

496
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,190
- so you'll be at ease.
- Exactly.

497
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,710
But our Jiawen is still young.

498
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,710
We're not in a rush.

499
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,120
Young?

500
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,710
As the saying goes,

501
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,120
flowers don't bloom forever.

502
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,640
Marrying early means peace of mind.

503
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,270
But she has to agree.

504
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,320
We'll talk to her when she gets back.

505
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Alright, He.

506
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,360
I'll wait for your reply.

507
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,270
Alright.

508
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,710
Okay then, see you.

509
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,960
He Jiawen.

510
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,750
What's wrong?

511
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,470
I got two movie tickets.

512
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,840
Can you go with me?

513
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,080
When is it?

514
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,990
It's starting soon.

515
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,400
Let's go.

516
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,880
I can't.

517
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,640
I have to go home.

518
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,670
Then let me give you a ride.

519
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
No need, it's just past this street.

520
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,270
It's very close.

521
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,510
I'll walk with you then.

522
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,360
You're skipping the movie?

523
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,470
Movies are always playing.

524
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,030
You don't need to walk me.
I'm almost there.

525
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,950
It's fine. Let me keep you company.

526
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,160
Then

527
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,080
shall we go next weekend?

528
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,110
Sure.

529
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,560
I should've asked you earlier this time.

530
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,840
Move aside!

531
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Mom?

532
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,510
Mom!

533
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
Jiawen!

534
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,260
- I was about to buy soy sauce.
- Mrs. He.

535
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,400
Can you walk?

536
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,670
- Right.
- I don't think so.

537
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,000
No, no.

538
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,410
Don't walk. Let me carry you.

539
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,360
That's not appropriate.

540
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,400
- It's fine.
- It's okay.

541
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,240
Let him carry you.

542
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,950
- Slow down.
- Okay.

543
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,920
- My bike...
- Got it.

544
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
That way.

545
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,670
- Sorry about this.
- No problem, Mrs. He.

546
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,750
- Thank you.
- Here, slowly.

547
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Let's go inside.

548
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,590
Yes.

549
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,510
Just put me on the recliner.

550
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,430
- This one.
- Good.

551
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,620
Thank you.

552
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,380
I can use this leg.

553
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,360
- Alright.
- Slow down.

554
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,640
Mom, what happened?

555
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,160
Did you go to war

556
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,100
and come back wounded?

557
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,470
I'm fine. Thanks to this young man.

558
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,360
Or I really didn't know

559
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,570
how I would've made it home.

560
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,670
- It's nothing.
- Thanks.

561
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,030
- I'm Jiawen's friend.
- Jiawen.

562
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,750
- It's okay.
- Go get the saffflower oil.

563
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,590
Okay.

564
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Is your foot okay?

565
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,750
No broken bones.

566
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,670
Seems a bit swollen.

567
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,000
A little.

568
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,270
No more saffflower oil.

569
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,670
Let's go to the hospital.

570
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,230
No, no need. It's fine.

571
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,320
Do we have high-proof liquor at home?

572
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,200
Yes.

573
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,670
Jiawen, get me some matches.

574
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,920
Okay.

575
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
Matches are here.

576
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,880
- Matches.
- Feels a little swollen.

577
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,400
It's alright.

578
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,470
Jiali, Jiawen.

579
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,270
Come on.

580
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,600
Move aside.

581
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,130
Are you performing acrobatics?

582
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,840
Mrs. He, bear with it.

583
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,680
Alright.

584
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,670
What's going on?

585
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,510
Sir.

586
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
Who are you?

587
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,110
I...

588
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,670
Go do your homework.

589
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,640
Stop standing around.

590
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,760
Hurry.

591
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,430
Young man, what's your name?

592
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,880
Mrs. He, I'm Chen Weiguo.

593
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,190
Weiguo.

594
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,770
Do you work in the same factory

595
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,740
as Jiawen?

596
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,950
The Starch Factory?

597
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
No.

598
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,840
I'm with the Grain Bureau's
Feed Company.

599
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,840
That's a good job.

600
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,110
Not bad.

601
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,710
What do your parents do?

602
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,950
Any siblings?

603
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,560
Mom, does your foot still hurt?

604
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,360
It's much better now.

605
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,710
I have to give it a good rub.

606
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,230
- You're really kind.
- Mrs. He.

607
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,070
No, no, it's nothing.

608
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,030
Please don't mention it.

609
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,510
If Mom

610
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,510
sees two ducks in the water,

611
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,030
she'll turn them into mandarin ducks.

612
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,120
Right. She refused a handsome one

613
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,430
and picked this dark-skinned guy.

614
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,870
I just

615
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,470
don't understand Jiawen.

616
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,840
Are you sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

617
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,840
No need. The bone's fine.

618
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,160
- It's fine.
- Rest is enough.

619
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,470
Such a good guy.

620
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,160
Mom.

621
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,110
By the way...

622
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,560
- Well.
- Here she goes again.

623
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,120
We need to thank you properly.

624
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,960
How about this?

625
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,560
Come over for dinner in a few days.

626
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,160
How about that?

627
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,920
OK, I'll visit you another day.

628
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,760
Great.

629
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,270
Mom, everyone's here.

630
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,430
Go ahead.

631
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,030
What's the rush?

632
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,510
Sit down.

633
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,380
(Mrs. Chen)
Everyone, speak.

634
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
(Chen Kesi)
Mom,

635
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,270
I'll go first.

636
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,780
(Chen Chunhua)
We're not superstitious,

637
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,320
but historically speaking,

638
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,320
there's a saying
that beauties bring trouble.

639
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,470
(Chen Chunrong)
Like the Xia Dynasty's Mo Xi,

640
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,600
the Shang Dynasty's Daji,

641
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,800
and the Zhou Dynasty's Baosi.

642
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,000
(Tao Yimin)
There are also

643
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,230
Xi Shi and Diaochan.

644
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,270
Who asked you to give a history lesson?

645
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,320
Chunrong, what do you think?

646
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,190
I think

647
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,030
her look matters,

648
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,080
but her character
and whether she's sensible

649
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,320
matter too.

650
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,600
Chunhua.

651
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,190
Mom, I've thought this through.

652
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,320
This is my decision.

653
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,640
I'm determined to marry He Jiawen.

654
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,640
I think you should

655
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,920
go to her house and propose for me

656
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,600
before it's too late.

657
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,080
Weiguo, let me ask you.

658
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,800
Are you really set on this?

659
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,120
I won't marry anyone else.

660
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,120
I understand now.

661
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,500
(No. 14 Beitou Alley)

662
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,560
Anyone home?

663
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,840
Hello.

664
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,840
Who are you looking for?

665
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,530
I'm here

666
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,030
to propose a marriage

667
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,120
for my son.

668
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,670
Who is your son?

669
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,510
My son is...

670
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,750
- Chen Weiguo?
- Yes.

671
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,190
Weiguo is my son.

672
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,430
- Please sit.
- You've met him?

673
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,430
Yes, I've met him.

674
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,360
- Please sit.
- OK.

675
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,640
That's great.

676
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,230
Have some tea.

677
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,130
No need to be so formal.

678
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,270
The two kids know each other,

679
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,920
they've interacted,

680
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,230
and there's a foundation.

681
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,030
My eldest son teaches
at the Party School.

682
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,310
My two daughters have stable jobs.

683
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,360
I don't work,

684
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,710
but my children are filial.

685
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,950
They give me money every month.

686
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
Thank you.

687
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Now, the only thing left

688
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,750
is Weiguo's marriage.

689
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,510
This is a big deal.

690
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,430
Weiguo works in the Grain Bureau.

691
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,270
He's a cadre.

692
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,510
If these two kids can be together,

693
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,160
they'll support each other.

694
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,560
That would be great.

695
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,270
Weiguo is a good kid.

696
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,110
Yes, yes.

697
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,120
I've met him.

698
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
But no matter how willing we are,

699
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,190
it's up to the two kids.

700
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,400
You're right.

701
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
We won't force them.

702
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,670
When Jiawen gets back,
please let her know.

703
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,080
I'd appreciate it if you could
put in a good word for us.

704
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,040
Let's see if they're truly meant to be.

705
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,750
Fate decides everything.

706
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,880
It's our first meeting,

707
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,670
and I wasn't sure what to bring.

708
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,560
These two bracelets

709
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,990
are a small gift for you.

710
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,990
Look

711
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,600
at how fine the jade is.

712
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,510
It's said they're
from the late Qing Dynasty.

713
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,640
It's rumored
to have come from the Palace.

714
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,160
Please, keep them.

715
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,030
No, no, I can't.

716
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,800
These are far too valuable.

717
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,000
Too valuable.

718
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,190
- I really can't.
- Please, no pressure.

719
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,110
Whether we become in-laws

720
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,200
depends on fate.

721
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,240
Whether we become friends

722
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,360
depends on you and me.

723
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
I'm just a simple woman

724
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
born to work.

725
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,950
I don't deserve such precious things.

726
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,630
I was looking

727
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,990
for someone who truly deserves them.

728
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,550
Please, keep them.

729
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,040
This...

730
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,590
Why did you accept her bracelets?

731
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,880
She came to propose.

732
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,990
This is a meeting gift.

733
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,790
Which is exactly why
you shouldn't take them.

734
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,990
I didn't want to.

735
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,880
I refused several times.

736
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,280
But she insisted I keep them.

737
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,430
And you just took them?

738
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,270
Then I...

739
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,630
So many people have come to propose,

740
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,070
and Jiawen didn't like any of them.

741
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,830
And now,
just because she brought bracelets,

742
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,030
you went ahead and kept them?

743
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,200
What were you thinking?

744
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,680
What was I thinking?

745
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
I think Jiawen

746
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,240
and Weiguo

747
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,800
like each other.

748
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,280
They really like each other.

749
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,200
How do you know?

750
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,880
I can tell.

751
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,400
That's why I accepted them.

752
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
What were you thinking?

753
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,770
Weiguo is a really good guy.

754
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,280
He looks nice,

755
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,590
has a good job,

756
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,760
and even is a cadre.

757
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,280
That's just your opinion.

758
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,200
You have to ask Jiawen

759
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,470
if she feels the same.

760
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Ask her.

761
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,070
If she doesn't,

762
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,400
return the bracelets immediately.

763
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,640
Got it?

764
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,550
Of course.

765
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,630
If it doesn't work out,
I'll give them back.

766
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,760
Why are you yelling at me?

767
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,040
I really don't know
what you're thinking.

768
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,360
Look at their family.

769
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,030
They've got some wealth.

770
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,800
They say these bracelets

771
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,720
came from the Palace

772
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,320
during the late Qing Dynasty.

773
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,800
The jade does look nice.

774
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,990
Who knows if it's real or not?

775
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,780
He Changsheng, when I married you,

776
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,840
your family didn't give me

777
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,800
any gold or silver.

778
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,550
Not even a meeting gift.

779
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,760
Does your family
have any heirlooms at all?

780
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,630
Of course.

781
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,540
My family's been generations
of poor peasants.

782
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,190
The only heirloom is

783
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,240
poverty.

784
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,720
No stable job,

785
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,630
and no stable relationship.

786
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,800
Can you not bring up bad memories?

787
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
If worst comes to worst,

788
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,240
just pick someone

789
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,110
from Jiawen's admirers

790
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,240
and develop feelings.

791
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,430
Enough.

792
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,880
Always talking about Jiawen.

793
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,230
I can't live without her, huh?

794
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,510
I have to up after her leftovers?

795
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,590
We're raised by the same parents.

796
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,110
Jiahuan, we have to live for ourselves.

797
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,990
Of course.

798
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,470
Of course, we will.

799
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,150
Growing up is such a hassle.

800
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,070
Jiayi,

801
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,940
I got tickets for an internal movie.

802
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,830
Do you want to go?

803
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,470
It's an American movie,

804
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,920
Waterloo Bridge.

805
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,630
No doubts?

806
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,490
No.

807
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,350
No reservations?

808
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,300
No.

809
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,470
No defeatism?

810
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,040
No.

811
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,920
Oh, life's been hard for you.

812
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,760
I know that.

813
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,430
You've had to struggle
and endure privation,

814
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
but that's all over now.

815
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,080
I love you.

816
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,920
Oh, Roy, you're so good.

817
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,910
You're so...

818
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,470
Jiahuan.

819
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,110
Wake up. The movie's over.

820
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,520
Let's go, Jiayi.

821
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,550
Jiayi, the movie's over.

822
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,110
Time to go home.

823
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,080
My bag.

824
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
Thank you.

825
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,840
Jiawen, what do you think of me?

826
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,280
You're great.

827
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,320
Then let's make it official.

828
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
- I swear...
- Stop.

829
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,630
It's so late.

830
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,030
Even the heavens are asleep.

831
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,430
No one's listening to your oaths.

832
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,400
Anyway, I'm saying

833
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,070
I've set my heart on you,

834
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,630
and I'll never change.

835
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,400
Don't say it like that.

836
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,840
Even if I agree,

837
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,430
this is just the first step
of a long journey.

838
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,280
As long as you take that first step,

839
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,630
I'll walk with you till the last.

840
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,030
In this lifetime,

841
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,720
it's just you and me, Jiawen.

842
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,400
My thoughts are simple.

843
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,110
I just want us to live

844
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,630
a good, steady life together.

845
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,820
Oh.

846
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,990
Oh as in yes, or oh as in no?

847
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,110
Oh means let's take it
one step at a time.

848
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,880
Then I'll take that as a yes.

849
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm home.

850
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,990
Dad, Mom, Jiali.

851
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,070
I've decided
to officially date Chen Weiguo.

852
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Good.

853
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,040
Agreed.

854
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,240
Observe first.

855
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,840
Don't rush to conclusions.

856
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,800
Yeah.

857
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,630
Take your time to get to know him.

858
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,280
So this is free love, huh?

859
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,470
The Grain Bureau is a decent workplace,

860
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,030
but the most important thing
is character.

861
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,800
He has to be steady and reliable.

862
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,630
He has to treat you well.

863
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,320
How about this?

864
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,070
Bring him home this Sunday

865
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,030
for dinner

866
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,950
so we can all meet him.

867
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,470
Dad, don't scare him off.

868
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,550
I'm always warm and welcoming.

869
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,630
When Jianguo first came over,

870
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,840
I was thrilled

871
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,680
and enthusiastic.

872
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,430
Why bring gifts, Weiguo?

873
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,470
It's only right.

874
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,590
Here, kiddo, have an orange.

875
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,990
- These are expensive.
- Thank him.

876
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,430
Thank you, Uncle.

877
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,430
You're welcome.

878
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,480
We both have "Guo" in our names.

879
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,630
That's right. You build it,

880
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,470
and I protect it.

881
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,510
A strong nation means a stable home.

882
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,950
Exactly.

883
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,720
Mr. He, are you working with leather?

884
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,030
Do you want to help me?

885
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:36,910
Sure.

886
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,030
- OK.
- Let's go.

887
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,680
- Dad, let me.
- No need.

888
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,630
Let him try. Let's go.

889
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,630
This is called tanning leather.

890
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,830
I'll warn you.

891
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,030
It's dirty, tiring work.
Are you up for it?

892
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,870
I don't mind.

893
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,400
This step here...

894
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,430
See this?

895
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,390
You have

896
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,840
to scrape off the fat layer.

897
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,870
Watch closely.

898
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,720
See?

899
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,240
Try it.

900
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,120
Alright.

901
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,070
Not in those clothes.

902
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,280
You'll ruin them.

903
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,520
Hold this for me.

904
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,040
I'll take it off.

905
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,990
Dad.

906
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,360
He has to adjust to the work.

907
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,200
That's right.

908
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,270
No problem.

909
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
Xiaonian, here.

910
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,590
I'll take it for you.

911
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,680
- Thanks.
- Let's go eat oranges.

912
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,680
Weiguo's got a solid build.

913
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,920
I've been fed well.

914
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,070
You're strong and sturdy.

915
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,280
Don't you think it's too hard for him?

916
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,400
He's looking for a successor.

917
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,680
Of course, he's being strict.

918
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,470
He wanted to pass this on to Jianguo,

919
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,720
but Jianguo never had the time.

920
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,070
Now, it's good.

921
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,680
He's found someone even better.

922
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,620
Dad's craftsmanship

923
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,680
finally has someone to carry it on.

924
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,790
Jiawen,

925
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,550
good choice.
