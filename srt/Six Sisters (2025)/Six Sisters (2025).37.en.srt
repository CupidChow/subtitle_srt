What's going on here?

16
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,190
Mom, you're back.

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,670
Mom, sit down.

18
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,640
Sit down.

19
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,910
What are you doing?

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,670
I'm just cleaning, Mom.

21
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,890
Sit.

22
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,550
Why did it turn into such a mess?

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Jiaxi.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,670
Are you looking for something?

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,160
What could I possibly be looking for?

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,150
Look, Mom's fine, right?

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,270
Why don't you guys go home first?

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,150
I'll take care of Mom.

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,430
Ok.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,390
Mom, take a rest.

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,800
We'll come visit you again.

32
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,390
We'll leave Mom to you.

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,240
Rest assured.

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,650
Take care.

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Mom.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,760
What's wrong with you?

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,670
You were fine before I left with Jiayi.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,270
Why did you leave home?

39
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,830
I'm not comfortable living here alone.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,390
I could have asked Xiaoman to stay with you.

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,550
If there's anything bothering you,

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,590
just tell me. How could I ignore you?

43
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,200
I resent it so much.

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,390
I didn't raise a good daughter.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
What's there to resent, Mom?

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,990
You resent...

47
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,870
Are you blaming me?

48
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,270
I don't blame you.

49
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,590
I can only blame myself.

50
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,200
- Alright.
- It's my destiny.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,870
Alright, don't be mad.

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,960
Don't blame anyone, okay?

53
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,230
Mom,

54
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,800
where did you put the pickle recipe?

55
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,430
Did you ransack the room to find the recipe?

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Yes.

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,390
I'm eager to learn.

58
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,670
I want to find the recipe

59
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,270
and figure out how to inherit it.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,640
You can't

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,590
inherit it.

62
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,960
I've given you the house.

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,830
I'm not giving you the recipe.

64
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,670
Mom, I'll tell you what.

65
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,270
Mom, can I make a deal with you?

66
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,830
I'll give you back the house.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,150
You give me the recipe, ok?

68
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,640
He Jiaxi,

69
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,150
I've favored you

70
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,760
since you were little.

71
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,920
How could I have raised

72
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
such an ungrateful wretch?

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,590
How am I ungrateful?

74
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,390
Why are you so stuck in your ways, Mom?

75
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,590
Think about it.

76
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,670
Sell that recipe,

77
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,590
and take the money.

78
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,200
If you think my care isn't good enough,

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,360
hire a nurse!

80
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,670
You'll still live comfortably.

81
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,870
Money, money, money!

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,640
All you think about is money!

83
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,430
Are you abandoning your ancestors' legacy?

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Mom, that's a lot of money.

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,870
Why can't I get through to you, Mom?

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,920
It's all my fault.

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,390
- Why can't I get through to you?
- Where

88
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,000
did I go wrong raising this child?

89
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,350
It's all my fault.

90
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,470
Where did I go wrong?

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
Why are you taking it off?

92
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,080
Do you see this?

93
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,390
This recipe

94
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,790
is the one and only in this world.

95
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,080
Mom, Mom!

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,830
- Mom!
- I burned it. Look!

97
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,000
- What are you doing?
- I burned it.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,590
- Burned, burned.
- Mom!

99
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,520
Are you insane?

100
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,350
No recipe.

101
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,000
There's no recipe now.

102
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,760
Are you still looking?

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
Are you crazy?

104
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,320
You are crazy, He Jiaxi!

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,680
I think you're crazy

106
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,830
about money!

107
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Mom.

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,120
It's money.

109
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,430
Meixin.

110
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
- Hurry.
- Ms. Liu.

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,350
You go first.

112
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,190
I'll cover you.

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,520
You bad person!

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,680
- Spy! Traitor!
- Yes.

115
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
- Meixin, go home.
- Bad person!

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
Alright, alright. I'll take you home.

117
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,800
Don't come any closer.

118
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Come on. Let's go.

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,830
- Meixin. Bad person!
- Let's go.

120
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,710
Yes, bad person.

121
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,960
Crazy women.

122
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,230
They're crazy!

Xiaoman?

Yes, Grandma. It's me.

Grandma.

146
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,550
It's cold outside.

147
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,270
Why did you come alone?

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,790
I told Mom and Dad

149
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,230
that I'd ring in the New Year by your side.

150
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,150
Where are they?

151
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,710
They are at home.

152
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
Sit.

153
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Have you eaten?

154
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes, I have.

155
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,790
Can I get you anything else?

156
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,710
No, thanks.

157
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,350
The house used to be abuzz.

158
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Now, they don't come to see you. It's quiet.

159
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,200
I'll do it, Grandma.

161
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,590
My mom's having a baby too.

162
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,470
They won't have time to visit you often.

163
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,280
There's less chance I'll come back.

164
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,950
Thanks, Grandma.

165
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,080
You mustn't think like that, Xiaoman.

166
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,080
I can take care of myself.

167
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,350
You know,

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,560
it's not bad to have a few siblings.

169
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,870
When you grow up,

170
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,920
you can help each other

171
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,040
when you're in any trouble.

172
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,470
My aunts and my mom

173
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
don't help each other.

174
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,230
It's not their fault.

175
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,870
It's Grandma's.

176
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,750
Grandma didn't

177
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,440
raise them right.

178
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,710
Are you ringing in the New Year with me?

179
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,750
Yes, I am.

180
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm afraid I'll snore before then.

181
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,550
Hello.

182
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,670
Mom.

183
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,230
Hello, Guangming.

184
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,830
I got in.

185
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
Did you get into graduate school?

186
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,220
Yes.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,610
Tomorrow is the second day of the New Year.

188
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,750
I've made a reservation at the hotel.

189
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,110
Do you want to call your sisters?

190
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
I just did.

191
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,830
None of them can come.

192
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,520
What does that mean?

193
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,280
Cancel the reservation.

194
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
It was made a month ago.

195
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,110
We can't make it again after canceling it.

196
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,680
But Mom's not coming.

197
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,320
What is left for us to even talk about?

198
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,960
Jiaxi completely disregarded our feelings.

199
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,230
She just said she's not coming.

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,280
She's probably feeling guilty

201
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,560
and afraid we'll bring up the house deed.

202
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,960
What's done

203
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,830
cannot be undone.

204
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,470
Even if it was undone,

205
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,750
it couldn't go back to what it was.

206
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,270
Have an orange.

207
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,280
Mom.

208
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,680
We've just bought an apartment,

209
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,320
and there's a baby on the way.

210
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,440
You've got your money's worth.

211
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,870
Sure, It's worth it!

212
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,560
Jiaxi,

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,230
when Hongyu said you were seriously sick,

214
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,830
I was so heartbroken.

215
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,940
In the end,

216
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,160
who'd have thought

217
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,280
you'd have a happy illness?

218
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
Isn't it great?

219
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,440
Mom, think about my name.

220
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,870
Jiaxi, happiness.

221
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,920
I was born to bring happiness.

222
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,990
Exactly.

223
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,230
This time, listen to Mom.

224
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,200
Take good care of your health.

225
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,510
Make sure to eat nourishing foods.

226
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,990
- I'll buy you...
- Mom.

227
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,440
I don't like sweets lately.

228
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,040
I like sour food.

229
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,950
Really?

230
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,830
Did you hear that?

231
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,200
She loves sour food.

232
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,750
Have an apple.

233
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,470
Open the door!

234
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,830
Open up.

235
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,680
Come out! Open the door!

236
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,640
Come out!

237
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,230
Open up!

238
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,690
Sir, Ma'am, happy New Year.

239
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,510
Can you at least pay back some money?

240
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,990
It's the New Year.

241
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,870
Don't push us to the brink.

242
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,830
Leave us the broth after your feast.

243
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,920
Seems we came for nothing.

244
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,680
Shall we head back for the New Year?

245
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,630
Alright, let's go back.

246
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
Go to hell!

247
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,630
Yes.

248
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,750
I know.

249
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,510
Yes, don't worry.

250
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,040
I'll give you an answer

251
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,630
in a few days.

252
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,160
I understand.

253
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,680
Industrialization is definitely a trend

254
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,870
with huge profit potential.

255
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,830
Ok, don't worry.

256
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,710
Wait for my reply.

257
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,510
Ok, that's it then.

258
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,470
Bye. You hang up first.

259
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,830
Keep it away.

260
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,520
Mom.

261
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,200
If you don't open the door,

262
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,630
I'm gonna sit here and stay.

263
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,830
I'll break down the door,

264
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
believe it or not.

265
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,080
Mom!

266
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,040
Didn't you see it?

267
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,230
I burned the recipe already.

268
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,230
I don't have it.

269
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,040
Don't give me a hard time.

270
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Mom,

271
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,990
even if you don't think of me,

272
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,830
think of Xiaoman.

273
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,830
After I die,

274
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,670
Xiaoman

275
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,920
- will get her share.
- Mom, I'm begging you.

276
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
Open the door!

277
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,140
I was wrong, ok?

278
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,230
I'll get down on my knees.

279
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll kowtow to you.

280
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,400
Mom!

281
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,440
I know you...

282
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,710
I know you're mad at me

283
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,800
for buying the apartment, right?

284
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,590
How about this?

285
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,110
You move in with me.

286
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
I've reserved a room for you.

287
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,670
Mom.

288
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,440
Mom, Mom!

289
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,200
What's wrong with you, Mom?

290
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,920
You were fine when I left

291
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,470
to attend the funeral.

292
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,710
What's with the attitude now?

293
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,630
Mom, I'm Jiaxi.

294
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,830
We're the closest.

295
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,870
What do you want?

296
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,630
Mom, whatever you're thinking,

297
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,630
let me know. You know I'll support you.

298
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,920
Mom, Mom!

299
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,560
Don't think

300
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,590
I want this house for my own good.

301
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,230
I'm doing it for you, Mom.

302
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,470
When the money comes in,

303
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,730
I'll put it all in your account, ok?

304
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,280
Liu Meixin,

305
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,830
you're determined, aren't you?

306
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,040
Don't make me do this

307
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
the hard way.

308
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,880
Liu Meixin!

309
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,990
Just scare her.

310
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,270
Don't hurt her.

311
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,270
Don't worry. You pay us.

312
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,310
We take care of it.

313
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,400
No worries.

314
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,960
Old lady, hand the recipe over.

315
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,060
Hand it over!

316
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,480
Who is it?

317
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,900
(Leave the recipe in the milk carton)

318
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,700
(and there's no trouble. Or you'll suffer.)

319
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,640
Where are you going so late?

320
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,120
- To the hospital.
- Hospital?

321
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,790
I'll go with you.

322
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,600
No, I'll go alone.

323
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,590
What's wrong?

324
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,030
Mom is ill.

325
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Pickle recipe.

326
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,230
Come on, stop looking.

327
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Jiaxi, I heard Mom is in the hospital.

328
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,000
Shall we go visit her?

329
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,720
Mom.

330
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,990
Mom probably doesn't want to see us.

331
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,960
And Jiali and the others must be there.

332
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,990
What's the point of asking for trouble?

333
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,870
Jiaxi,

334
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,600
tell me the truth.

335
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,750
How did you get the recipe?

336
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,520
What...

337
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,710
What...

338
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,790
What do you mean?

339
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,270
I got it legally and reasonably.

340
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
This recipe

341
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,550
is worth 600,000 yuan.

342
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,400
600,000.

343
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,070
Jiali.

344
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,910
What's wrong?

345
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,440
No worries. Her heart rate spiked briefly,

346
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,750
but it's stabilized now.

347
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,550
Thank you, Qiufang.

348
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,840
Don't worry. It's nothing serious.

349
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,240
Meixin,

350
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,360
how are you feeling?

351
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,470
Better.

352
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,790
When the IV drip finishes,

353
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,990
stay for a while for observation.

354
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,990
If all checks out, you're good to go home.

355
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,550
Thank you, Qiufang.

356
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,200
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

357
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,480
Jiali, I have to go home now.

358
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,680
I was in a hurry

359
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
and locked my mom in the house.

360
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm sorry for the trouble. Go home.

361
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,400
Meixin, I'm leaving.

362
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,440
Thank you, Qiufang.

363
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,310
No problem.

364
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,390
Mom.

365
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,180
(Outpatient)

366
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,270
I'll call Jiaxi.

367
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,880
She has to show up,

368
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,230
right now, immediately.

369
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,030
She is my daughter.

370
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,200
Does that make you any less of one?

371
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,960
You're the one disowning me.

372
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,600
Do you still think I'm your mom?

373
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm not going home.

374
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
If you don't go home,

375
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
you should stay in the hospital.

376
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,070
Then I'll stay in the hospital

377
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,470
and let others laugh at me.

378
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
Mom, don't make trouble.

379
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
You have to go home.

380
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,200
I can't sleep at home.

381
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,030
Then where can you sleep?

382
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,240
Jiali.

383
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,750
I told you not to come. Why did you come?

384
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,440
It's the hospital. Tone it down.

385
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,990
Jianguo.

386
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,830
Mom.

387
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,990
I'm here to take you home.

388
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,510
If you don't have a place to sleep,

389
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,790
sleep at our place.

390
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,990
Don't we have a spare room?

391
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't think so.

392
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,070
Jiali.

393
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,110
Mom,

394
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,680
don't be mad at her.

395
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,480
Come.

396
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,120
Give me a hand.

397
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,710
Jianguo, walk slowly.

398
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,630
I know.

399
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,750
Watch out for the steps.

400
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,800
Ok.

401
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Jianguo,

402
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,790
go get a taxi.

403
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,510
I came by tricycle. Wait a minute.

404
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,840
It's right here.

405
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Where did you get it?

406
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,840
I was afraid it was hard to take a taxi here,

407
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,470
so I borrowed a tricycle.

408
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,990
- Ok.
- You're kidding me.

409
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,070
At your age,

410
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,440
still pedaling this tricycle?

411
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,750
- No problem.
- Are you sure you can manage?

412
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,790
Mom, I can.

413
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,200
It's just hard on you.

414
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,550
I feel at ease with you riding it.

415
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,310
Be careful.

416
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,710
Ok. I'll sit here.

417
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,550
I've got a good seat.

418
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,470
- Ok, now.
- Jiali, hop on.

419
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,750
Take it easy.

420
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,830
Seated, huh?

421
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,680
Are we too heavy, Jianguo?

422
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,920
No, it's fine. I...

423
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,840
- I'll give you a push.
- No, no, no.

- Sure.
- Thanks.

427

No problem.

428
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,040
Sit tight.

Let me help.

430
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,640
- Thank you, young man.
- No problem.

431

Ok, thanks.

- Thanks.

Yes, noodles are fine.

Jianguo,

461
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,400
I'll pay for the food.

Mom, are you kidding?

463
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,270
- You don't have to pay.
- You don't.

464
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,200

It's not enough to have the recipe.

469
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,790
They demand full production process details

470
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,840
and hands-on training from the owner

471
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,230

this is my house.

Get out!

Go!

546
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,840
Jiaxi behaves

547
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,270
as if she was possessed.

548
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,400
She'd abandon family for petty cash.

549
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,840
We should hand her over to the government.

550
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,310
It's none of the government's business.

551
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,920
It's my fault.

552
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,550
I shouldn't have had so many daughters.

553
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,640
What a sin.

554
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Mom, don't say that.

Even a brood has bad eggs.

Do you think

559
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,070
I don't know each daughter's

560
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,030
vision and character?

561
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,290
I keep a clear account.

562
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,230
But in my heart, every child is precious.

563
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,440
Yet some are more precious.

564
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,270
Even your five fingers

565
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,400
aren't equal,

566
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
right?

567
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,990
But they all pulse from the same heart.

568
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,310
I've given her the recipe.

569
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,510
What else does she want?

570
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,900
She's pissing me off.

571
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,030
She must be in some trouble

572
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,270
and needs your help.

573
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,270
Mom, from now on,

574
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,070
stay within the yard and you'll be safe.

575
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,640
Mom's become the Tang Monk?

576
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,790
Trapped in this circle?

577
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,270
Mom's basically our family's Tang Monk.

578
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,200
We must protect her

579
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,470
from being eaten by demons,

580
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,070
right, Pigsy?

581
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm Monkey King.

582
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,440
I'll draw a protective circle

583
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
with my Golden Cudgel.

584
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,040
Have some water.

585
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
I don't want water.

586
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,790
Get me an ice pop.

587
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,510
Can you eat that?

588
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,990
Get me one quickly!

589
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,510
Now, I badly need an ice pop

590
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,640
to cool me down.

591
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,030
It even makes my head ache.

592
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,520
Here.

593
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,240
Your nose...

594
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,440
Come on, raise your right hand.

595
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,600
It's ok. Don't make a fuss.

596
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,920
I have a weak nose that bleeds easily.

597
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,440
Still bleeding?

598
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,880
Why do you bleed from both nostrils?

599
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,070
Wipe it.

600
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,310
Hurry up.

601
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,070
Tilt your head back.

602
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,270
Press your nose with your hands.

603
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,830
Look up.

604
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,230
I'm ok.

605
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,960
Look up.

606
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,030
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

607
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,400
Will it affect the baby?

608
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,990
According to the test results,

609
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,400
we can't rule out

610
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,270
leukemia at this stage.

611
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,600
Doctor, are you mistaken?

612
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,840
My wife is in good health.

613
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,990
If you have concerns about the diagnosis,

614
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,880
seek a second opinion at a major hospital.

615
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,510
I suggest a prompt treatment

616
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,470
and there's still hope.

617
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,680
What you need to do now

618
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,510
is to terminate her pregnancy.

619
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,300
(Ward 04)

620
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,120
What's wrong with you guys?

621
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,310
What did the doctor say?

622
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,440
Nothing.

623
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,960
The doctor said you should stay here.

624
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,070
With proper care, you'll be fine.

625
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,720
Yan Hongyu, don't lie to me.

626
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,670
Why would I stay here if nothing is wrong?

627
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,880
Nothing, really.

628
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,510
Say it! No big deal. I can handle it.

629
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,280
There's nothing to say.

630
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,440
Xiaoman, you tell Mom.

631
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,240
You're fine, Mom.

632
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,760
Just listen to the doctor. Be good.

633
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,600
Xiaoman,

634
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,190
I can tell when you're lying to me.

635
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,470
I'm not lying, really.

636
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,630
Have I got an incurable disease?

637
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,680
No.

638
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,920
(Yibao Hotel)
Hope to see you again.

639
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,870
Jiayi.

640
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,240
Hongyu, Xiaoman?

641
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,400
Why are you here?

642
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,880
Aunt, my mom has a terminal illness.

643
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,680
What?

644
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes.

645
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,110
What's wrong?

646
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,760
Jiayi,

647
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,440
Jiaxi has got leukemia.

648
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,510
Ward 4.

649
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,760
It's up ahead.

650
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,870
Jiaxi.

651
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Hi.

652
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,110
Did Xiaoling come?

653
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,400
I didn't tell her.

654
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,590
Don't tell Jiali or Jiawen either.

655
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,720
How can you hide something like this?

656
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,190
Jiayi,

657
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,280
don't tell Mom.

658
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,440
Jiayi, Jiahuan.

659
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,080
Get ready.

660
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,680
We'll abort the baby first.

661
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,630
Too many people here.

662
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,510
Only one person stays.

663
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,670
The rest wait outside.

664
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,560
Jiaxi,

665
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,670
focus on your treatment, ok?

666
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,240
He Jiaxi, right?

667
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,280
Yes.

668
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,920
She's in such a critical condition.

669
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,190
It isn't appropriate to keep this

670
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,320
from Jiali and Mom.

671
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,720
I'm going to tell Jiali.

672
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,830
Call Jiawen

673
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,510
and ask her to tell Jiali.

674
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,510
I'll call her.

675
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,640
Mom.

676
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,510
I'm so sorry.

677
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,510
How come you became like this

678
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,030
in such a short time?

679
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,800
Don't worry.

680
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,110
Get some rest.

681
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,470
You'll be fine.

682
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,030
Get some rest.

683
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,800
Hongyu, I don't mean to blame you,

684
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,190
but why didn't you tell us earlier?

685
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,670
- Take this.
- Mom...

686
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,470
Take it.

687
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
(Bankbook)
I don't need it recently.

688
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,670
You're going to face

689
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,590
a lot of expenses.

690
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,720
Take it.

691
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,280
The password

692
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,150
is Jiaxi's birthday.

693
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,680
Mom,

694
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,840
I want to apologize for Jiaxi.

695
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,440
She is a jerk. I'm a jerk too.

696
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,720
Stop it. Stop it,

697
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,560
Hongyu.

698
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,470
How did this happen?

699
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,590
Hongyu,

700
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,190
open the window quickly.

701
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,030
The smell is choking me.

702
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,920
No hurry.

703
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,550
This apartment is like a gas chamber,

704
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,390
you know?

705
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,900
I warned you

706
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,720
repeatedly when the renovation ended,

707
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,990
"Don't rush the move-in,"

708
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,240
"Don't rush the move-in."

709
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,330
You wouldn't listen.

710
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,840
Otherwise,

711
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,880
Jiaxi wouldn't have got an incurable disease.

712
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,720
It's curable.

713
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,280
Definitely.

714
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,470
The doctor said it's curable.

715
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,630
Yes, it's curable.

716
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,920
Listen to me,

717
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,030
Hongyu. Sell the house

718
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,630
immediately if you can,

719
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,470
you hear me?

720
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,400
Don't hold out for a higher price.

721
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,440
Jiaxi's treatment can't wait.

722
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,470
I know.

723
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,190
Hand me that bag.

724
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,630
Given the current situation,

725
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,670
a bone marrow transplant may be required

726
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,440
for optimal treatment outcomes.

727
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,280
HLA matching is crucial.

728
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,880
Siblings have

729
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,190
higher compatibility rates.

730
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,030
What did the doctor say?

731
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,030
What's the treatment plan?

732
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,560
Jiali,

733
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Jiaxi's condition could go either way,

734
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,030
depending on the circumstances.

735
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,070
Cut the crap. Get to the point.

736
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,720
Jiali,

737
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,110
Jiaxi needs

738
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,280
a bone marrow transplant.

739
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,030
The doctor said siblings have

740
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,280
the highest HLA match probability.

741
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,800
I'm begging you to save her life.
