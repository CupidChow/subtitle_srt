00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,100
I'm going to have a baby.

What did you say?

17
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,260
I'm pregnant.

18
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,620
You stupid girl.

19
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,100
This baby...

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,930
I must have this baby.

21
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,060
Have you thought it through?

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,220
I have.

23
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,260
It's not too late to change your mind.

24
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,220
Go to the hospital

25
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,500
and ask Qiufang for help.

26
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,660
No one will know.

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,100
- Yes.
- We'll keep your secret.

28
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,940
No need.

29
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,500
I've thought it over.

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,850
I'm going to have this baby.

31
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,610
You'll suffer.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,610
Jiali,

33
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,660
just give me the household register.

34
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,570
Ok.

35
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,340
The family can't stand what you've done.

36
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,500
This is all your dowry.

37
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,540
Take it and leave.

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,380
Jiali.

39
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,570
Dad's mourning period isn't over yet.

40
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,130
We won't give you a wedding.

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,850
I'll send the household register to you.

42
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,290
Jiayi.

43
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,380
Jiali.

44
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,220
Jiayi.

45
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,850
What happened?

46
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,730
Didn't they agree?

47
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,660
Jiali, don't do this.

48
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,730
Jiali.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,940
Let's go. Come on.

50
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,780
Go.

51
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,500
- What happened?
- Ouyang Bao!

52
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,820
Come here.

53
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,500
Wait for me.

54
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,570
I'm coming.

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,050
Jiali, don't be mad.

56
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,850
I didn't do it on purpose.

57
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,460
I'll be good to Jiayi.

58
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,020
That's how you are good to her?

59
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,460
I'll be good to her!

60
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,810
I'm in love with her!

61
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,930
You remember,

62
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,850
Jiayi is not alone.

63
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,900
If you dare to bully her,

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,540
my whole family won't let you off!

65
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,580
Jiali,

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,020
I swear,

67
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,700
if I'm not good to her,

68
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,900
I will die a horrible death!

69
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,650
Leave.

70
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,460
Go!

71
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,090
Jiayi, let's go.

72
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,450
Come.

73
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,890
Come.

74
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
Don't cry.

75
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,450
Dad.

76
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,330
Dad.

77
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,100
Ms. Liu, are you home?

78
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,410
Yes.

79
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,290
Here's a letter for you.

80
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,140
Hefei University of Technology (HFUT).

81
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,810
He got in!

82
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,650
Congratulations!

83
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,730
Qiulin, you got in.

84
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,570
Thanks.

85
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,610
Meixin.

86
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,540
Congratulations.

87
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,420
Meixin,

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,850
they both got in.

89
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Jiahuan?

90
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,900
Qinlin got into HFUT.

91
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,930
Jiahuan did well, too.

92
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,050
College of Finance and Trade (CFT).

93
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,580
They are both college students.

94
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,610
Ms. Liu, is that true?

95
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,730
That's true.

96
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,100
The colleges have published the lists.

97
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,020
Their acceptance letters are in the mail.

98
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,220
Haven't you received it?

99
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,930
- No.
- You'll get it soon.

100
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,850
We have a college student in the family.

101
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,170
What great news!

102
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,410
Jiahuan.

103
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,940
Jiahuan.

104
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,490
Did you get in?

105
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,930
Yes, I got into a junior college.

106
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,980
Come out.

107
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,100
Come out quickly!

108
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,170
It's in Bengbu!

109
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
Isn't Bengbu nice?

110
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,250
- Bengbu is near.
- That's right.

111
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,290
I thought it was in Hefei.

112
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,250
But it was moved to Bengbu in 1961.

113
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,850
Still, it's a college,

114
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,700
right?

115
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,460
College classrooms are big.

116
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,850
You need glasses.

117
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,980
How do you like it?

118
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,130
Isn't it

119
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,410
a bit old-fashioned?

120
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,970
When will you get enrolled?

121
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,050
- Next week. You?
- What about this?

122
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,900
Soon.

123
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,540
Jiahuan?

124
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,300
Jiali.

125
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,900
Are you also here to get glasses?

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,460
You did great, Qiulin.

127
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,850
You got into HFUT.

128
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,700
Jiahuan did great, too.

129
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,770
Let's go.

130
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,410
No more picking?

131
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,250
None of them look good.

132
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,740
See you.

133
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,340
(Wu's Grocery)

134
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,770
Here.

135
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,380
Ok.

136
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,250
I was looking for you.

137
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,050
He Jiahuan.

138
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,410
Did I offend you?

139
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,850
No. Move.

140
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,980
I won't.

141
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,810
If there's a problem, let's solve it.

142
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,340
Your attitude is unacceptable.

143
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,940
You did it on purpose.

144
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,700
What did I do?

145
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,730
You didn't tell me the college was moved.

146
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,490
I didn't know.

147
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,690
Besides,

148
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,250
isn't that a good place?

149
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,660
No!

150
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,490
No?

151
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,060
I think it's good.

152
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,020
(Blessings come to the whole family)

153
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,940
(Marriage Certificate)

154
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,980
22.

155
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,820
What's so great about it?

156
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,730
It makes me happy.

157
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,660
Jiayi,

158
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,180
you're all the reason

159
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,730
I'm fighting.

160
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,260
Rest assured.

161
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,650
I'll give you the best life.

162
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
That's not why I married you.

163
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,900
Yes.

164
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,650
You married me because of who I am.

165
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,220
Because you love me.

166
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,650
It's moving.

167
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,580
It's little.

168
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,650
How can it move?

169
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,900
Let me hear it.

170
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,530
It's talking to me.

171
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,530
I know.

172
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,340
Dad is good, right?

173
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,100
Mom is good, too.

174
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,490
- I'll pay for it.
- No, Jiali.

175
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,330
Let me pay.

176
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,420
I've got the money.

177
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,730
Then take this.

178
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,820
Jiali.

179
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,490
- Keep it.
- Jiali.

180
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,140
Thanks.

181
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,700
What's this?

182
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
It's not for you.

183
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,940
It's for Jiayi.

184
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,770
When you're free, go visit her.

185
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,980
She didn't get anything when she got married,

186
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,300
but it doesn't mean we don't care about her.

187
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,010
She has to figure this out for herself.

188
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,890
She's old enough

189
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,220
to know right from wrong.

190
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,180
Yeah, I guess she knows she was wrong.

191
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,100
Don't tell her it's from me.

192
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,730
What should I say?

193
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,890
Don't mention anyone in particular.

194
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,730
Just say

195
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,370
it's from the family.

196
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,420
Got it. Not Jiali,

197
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,490
the family.

198
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,820
Don't be upset.

199
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,610
It's not good for your baby.

200
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,100
They were mad that day.

201
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,010
What they said was an angry outburst.

202
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,610
In a month

203
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,010
or so,

204
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,730
when they calm down, everything will be fine.

205
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,580
They were angry,

206
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,060
but I was telling the truth.

207
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,180
I don't owe them anything.

208
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,610
I must show them

209
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,580
what I'm made of.

210
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,890
Once I got out of that door,

211
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,100
I didn't have a family.

212
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,220
Jiayi, you can't

213
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,100
be so sure about that.

214
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,450
Jiawen,

215
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,010
what did you get when you got married?

216
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,460
I just

217
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,610
got a quilt.

218
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,370
I was kicked out of the house.

219
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,610
Let's talk about something good.

220
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,540
Take this.

221
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,850
It's from the family.

222
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,140
Look,

223
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,890
you're family.

224
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Your family

225
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,300
will always care about you.

226
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,180
There are things

227
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,420
you have to figure out

228
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,490
for yourself.

229
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,980
When you're given an out,

230
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,820
you should take the chance.

231
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,580
Good advice

232
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,250
jars on the ear.

233
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,130
But don't think too much.

234
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,370
Take care of yourself.

235
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,730
Let's talk

236
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,340
about family matters

237
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,010
when you're settled.

238
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,060
Jiawen, you're here.

239
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,420
Ouyang,

240
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,890
you're back.

241
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,370
I have to go now.

242
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,610
Why don't you join us for dinner?

243
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,850
No, thanks.

244
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,610
Take care of Jiayi.

245
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,660
Rest assured.

246
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,580
Jiawen, about the family...

247
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,420
Don't worry.

248
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,060
Ok, thank you.

249
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,370
Goodbye, Jiawen.

250
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,300
What's wrong, honey?

251
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,420
We've got a windfall.

252
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,610
I found it at the door.

253
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,450
Check it out.

254
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,250
I bought peanuts and melon seeds.

255
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,300
Mom loves such notes.

256
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,900
Mom.

257
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,130
Was Mom here?

258
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,540
Look.

259
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,140
Honey,

260
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,060
there's something

261
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,370
I've wanted to tell you.

262
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,490
She is your own mom,

263
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
and you're her own daughter.

264
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,420
I think that's about it.

265
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,220
Let's forgive each other where we can.

266
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,850
The whole family is watching.

267
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,220
You don't want to go into a dead end.

268
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,250
Isn't it your fault?

269
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,610
- If it wasn't for you...
- Yes.

270
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,060
It's my fault. Don't be angry.

271
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,250
Stay calm for the baby's sake.

272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,060
Honey, your first priority

273
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,610
is to take good care of yourself,

274
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,650
keep a good mood,

275
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,460
and give birth to the baby safely.

276
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,890
Jiahuan, this is for you.

277
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,260
Thanks, Jiawen.

278
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,820
Money's your favorite.

279
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,730
This is for you.

280
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,460
Didn't you give it to her already?

281
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,460
It's from Jianyi,

282
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,610
an expression of her good will.

283
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,490
How's she doing?

284
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,580
She's doing well.

285
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,420
She is

286
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,850
smart

287
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,220
and flexible. Don't worry about her.

288
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,370
Times have changed.

289
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,220
Blessings or suffers,

290
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,420
you'll have to take them yourselves.

291
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,820
It's out of our hands.

292
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,940
It's finally done.

293
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,710
There's nothing to worry about.

294
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,440
What's Kyoko doing?

295
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,730
She's taking a bath.

296
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,820
Why are you up so late?

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,890
There is something.

298
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,520
- You took the job from me.
- Don't be angry.

299
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,580
Aren't you going to do it tomorrow?

300
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,640
What's it?

301
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,980
Don't scold her.

302
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,010
I won't. Tell me.

303
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,820
Enough.

304
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,010
She went to Haneda Airport.

305
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,010
When I'm gone,

306
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,000
you'll get the bottom bunk.

307
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,030
I saw her.

308
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,410
But I was on the phone then.

309
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,650
I just heard about the accident.

310
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,190
So you missed each other?

311
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,450
What?

312
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,130
My gift to you.

313
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,580
Take it back. Are you kidding?

314
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,130
I'm your elder sister.

315
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,060
Anyway,

316
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,100
you're noble.

317
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,010
You're great.

318
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,180
Silly Xiaoling,

319
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,180
you're not silly if you can think of this.

320
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,540
Take it back.

321
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,460
Jiahuan,

322
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,140
can I wear your glasses?

323
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,170
Let me try them on.

324
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,530
You know what,

325
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,490
it's so clear.

326
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,530
You can see from far away.

327
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,570
See if it looks good on me.

328
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,010
What do you think?

329
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,860
Ghost!

330
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,220
Be quiet.

331
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,290
It's me.

332
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,820
It's me.

333
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,770
We're leaving tomorrow.

334
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,940
I don't want any misunderstanding.

335
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,010
Do you have to sneak around at night?

336
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,330
I came here to explain to you.

337
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,570
I swear

338
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,940
I didn't know your college is in Bengbu.

339
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,300
Besides,

340
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,050
why didn't you take a look

341
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,660
when you filled out your application?

342
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,940
If I'd known, I'd have checked it for you.

343
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,980
Don't be mad.

344
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,330
We're best friends.

345
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,730
Remember to write to me.

346
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,140
I don't know your address.

347
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,530
I know yours.

348
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,980
I'll write to you first.

349
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,570
Remember to write me back.

350
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,370
Don't forget.

351
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,060
(Wishing you good health)

352
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,050
This is from me.

353
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,490
This is from Jiali.

354
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,140
I don't want it.

355
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,940
Just a little gift from your elder sisters.

356
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,050
Forget about the younger ones.

357
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,460
I'll take yours.

358
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,460
But I won't accept Jiali's.

359
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,180
Why?

360
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,660
Do you have to treat us differently?

361
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,810
I haven't made up with her yet.

362
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,490
It's not right to take her gifts.

363
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,420
Besides,

364
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,810
she's struggling to make ends meet.

365
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,420
I can't take her money.

366
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,250
You're quite considerate.

367
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,780
Did Jiali

368
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,980
say anything?

369
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,050
She told you to live a good life.

370
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,330
What about Mom?

371
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,180
She is happy for you.

372
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,140
And Grandma?

373
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,570
How's she doing?

374
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,050
Is she well?

375
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,810
She is well.

376
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,220
She misses you every day.

377
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,700
She asks when you're coming home.

378
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,420
Still, I won't go home.

379
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,180
Never say never.

380
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,700
Don't think about it now.

381
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,460
Take care of yourself.

382
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,050
Let's take it one step at a time, ok?

383
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,220
Sun Wukong, Great Sage Equaling Heaven.

384
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,060
Xiaobao, here.

385
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,620
Don't call him Xiaobao.

386
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,090
Your name is Bao.

387
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,460
There are several Baos in your family.

388
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,220
Then what should we call him?

389
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,050
When I was in the hospital,

390
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,860
I saw a red maple tree

391
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,290
on the screen wall,

392
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,460
which was festive.

393
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,420
Why don't we call him Ouyang Feng,

394
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,660
referring to maple trees?

395
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,940
Good name. Ok.

396
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,290
Feng.

397
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,540
- Feng.
- Feng.

398
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,530
Daddy.

399
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,730
Feng, you have a name now.

400
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,770
Daddy wants to kiss you.

401
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,470
It's all good.

402
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,140
The baby is over eight jin.

403
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,290
Her father-in-law is very happy.

404
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,600
Over eight jin?

405
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,290
Jiayi is lucky.

406
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,980
What else did she say?

407
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,810
She sent her regards.

408
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,170
That's all?

409
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
So she's not repentant at all?

410
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,060
Enough.

411
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,220
What's done is done.

412
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,660
Why do you want her to repent?

413
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,980
Are you saying we were wrong

414
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,860
and she was right?

415
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,490
What she did was wrong.

416
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,290
But she has to make the best of her mistake.

417
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,180
Alright,

418
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,860
if she can make a good living,

419
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,090
I'll give her my blessing.

420
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,920
Where do they live now?

421
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,250
In the rented house.

422
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,420
See, that's what I was afraid of.

423
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,180
She didn't ask her husband for anything.

424
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,290
Instead, she fought with us.

425
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,050
She should ask them for what she wanted.

426
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,220
Forget it.

427
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,380
She's on her own.

428
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,220
I can't help her.

429
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,380
The congee is overflowing.

430
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,060
Meixin.

431
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,650
What's this?

432
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,090
She turned it down.

433
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,180
The door is open.

434
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,220
If you don't get me the wonton now,

435
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,860
I'll lose my appetite.

436
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,860
I'm here to see He Jiayi.

437
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,460
Jiali.

438
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,180
You have a family now.

439
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,490
If you can't do much housework,

440
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,290
ask Ouyang to do more.

441
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,420
Keep the house clean

442
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,860
and you'll feel good.

443
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,010
How's your postnatal recovery?

444
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,890
Not bad.

445
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,250
Grandma's getting old.

446
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,530
Mom isn't well, either.

447
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,250
Like me,

448
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,330
you don't have in-laws.

449
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,620
If you can, find a nanny.

450
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,460
Ouyang said that too.

451
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,940
But the house is too small.

452
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,620
There's no place for a nanny.

453
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,860
Let me see the baby.

454
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,250
He looks just like you.

455
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,300
I don't want it.

456
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,860
You accepted others' money.

457
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,220
Why don't you accept mine?

458
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,940
It won't burn you.

459
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,050
We didn't approve of you marrying Ouyang

460
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,050
because we were afraid you'd be fooled.

461
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,940
You're a mom now.

462
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,860
You've been through so much.

463
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,660
You should know better.

464
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,460
When you have time and get well,

465
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,140
remember to come home.

466
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,660
Mom and Grandma miss you.

467
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,860
They don't miss me.

468
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,730
And you

469
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,010
tried to sweep me out like rubbish.

470
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,410
Ok.

471
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,860
Say whatever you want.

472
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,660
I just wished you could be better.

473
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,290
You got pregnant

474
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,660
before you got married.

475
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,060
Is that right?

476
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,860
Sisters don't have overnight grudges.

477
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,050
Let bygones be bygones.

478
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,220
Let's look ahead.

479
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,890
Honey,

480
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,090
here comes the chicken soup wonton!

481
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,380
Chicken soup wonton!

482
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,540
Jiali?

483
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,330
Ouyang,

484
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,620
when I entrusted you with Jiayi,

485
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,660
what did you say?

486
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,460
Jiali,

487
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,090
I didn't let her suffer at all.

488
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,980
Look,

489
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,250
I bought her chicken soup wonton.

490
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,620
Then why is she crying?

491
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,090
I'm not crying because of him.

492
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,940
What are you waiting for?

493
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,010
Bring it over.

494
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,050
What took you so long?

495
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,660
She has lost her appetite.

496
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,700
It's popular. I had to wait in line.

497
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,090
I'm only doing this once.

498
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,050
Enjoy it.

499
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,850
Enough.

500
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,010
I'll eat it myself.

501
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,020
Alright,

502
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,940
don't cry.

503
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,010
It's bad for your recovery.

504
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,730
Don't cry.

505
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,940
Did I make you cry?

506
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,220
Or do you think it's me?

507
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,490
No, of course not.

508
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,900
It's me, definitely.

509
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,890
Ouyang,

510
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,460
you don't have a helper around here.

511
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,750
I think you should find her a nanny.

512
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,460
We're going to hire one.

513
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,340
I'll get one

514
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,090
from the north of the Huai River.

515
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,820
(Best price for duck and goose feathers)

516
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,090
Duck feathers.

517
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,820
How much?

518
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,700
Seven jin and two liang.

519
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,090
Ok.

520
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,500
Here.

521
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,530
Don't you think it's a little risky?

522
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,700
Can you sell all the stock?

523
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,770
It isn't risky.

524
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,660
It's going to be a cold winter this year.

525
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,460
The factories have a high demand.

526
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,420
Be sure to sell it out.

527
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,770
Of course, honey.

528
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,460
We're going to be rich.

529
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,540
Ok.

530
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,780
Eight jin and four liang.

531
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,700
(January, 1986)

532
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,340
(Liu Xiaoling, He's fifth daughter)

533
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,540
Jiahuan!

534
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,130
You're back.

535
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,180
What are you doing here?

536
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,290
To pick you up.

537
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,220
Mom said

538
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,980
the only college student in our family

539
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,250
must be picked up

540
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,660
or she won't be happy.

541
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,740
Sweet Mom.

542
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Is Qiulin back yet?

543
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,180
Yes.

544
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,250
No, I don't think so.

545
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,900
Is he back or not?

546
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,900
How do I know?

547
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,980
All you know is eating!

548
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,380
Jianguo is trying you help you out.

549
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,770
But you have to pass

550
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,730
the basic recruitment exams.

551
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,380
(He Jiaxi, He's sixth daughter)
I'm tried.

552
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,090
But the exams were too hard.

553
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,330
- Four.
- Very hard.

554
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,610
Six.

555
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,730
Why don't you do a rush job

556
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,490
of studying for the exams?

557
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,530
You have to do this on your own.

558
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,460
Jiaxi, you should try harder.

559
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,900
Mom, I'm trying hard enough.

560
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,180
I've given it my best shot.

561
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,010
Then keep up the good work

562
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,900
and you'll jump over the Dragon Gate.

563
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,780
Dragon Gate?

564
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,940
She'll be lucky if she doesn't fall.

565
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,900
Pass.

566
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,220
You're home, Jiaxi.

567
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,420
- What's wrong?
- Jiaxi

568
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,770
is usually smart,

569
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,220
but she can't pass any exams.

570
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,220
She didn't get into the glass factory.

571
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,180
She came second to last.

572
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,010
She's lucky she didn't come in last.

573
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,620
Grandma, are you in the mood to laugh?

574
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,570
That Silly Xie came in last.

575
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,700
What was on the exam?

576
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,250
Just what's in the middle school textbooks.

577
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,250
Then how could she fail it?

578
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,010
I'm sure when she was sitting there

579
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:52,980
during the exam,

580
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,050
her mind was somewhere else.

581
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,220
The dragon's nine sons are all different.

582
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,420
It was easy for Jiahuan to get into college.

583
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,050
Jiahuan is at home now.

584
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,770
Let her tutor Jiaxi.

585
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,620
I hear the school-run factory

586
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,770
of No. 14 Elementary School is still hiring.

587
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,980
Jiaxi, you still have opportunities.

588
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,860
(Recruitment Exam)

589
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,700
Look what you have done.

590
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,010
They're making it difficult on purpose.

591
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,290
I just want to be a worker,

592
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,180
producing glass

593
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,020
or doing printing.

594
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,620
What's the point of such exams?

595
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,810
Can I get someone to take them for me?

596
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,000
Don't even think of it.

597
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,810
Rework the paper.

598
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,650
Qiulin,

599
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,490
your writing brings you to life.

600
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,420
I didn't get to see you last summer.

601
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,770
In the blink of an eye,

602
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,220
it's...

603
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,900
Letter for No. 28, Yanhuai Road.

604
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,260
Thanks.

605
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,860
- Nothing else?
- No.

606
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,260
(To Hejiali)

607
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,460
(Pastry and Cookie)
Do you think

608
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,220
they'll give us more money for big boxes?

609
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,300
They won't.

610
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,730
What's the difference?

611
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,280
Big or small, we'll paste them the same.

612
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,660
We're lucky to earn a little money.

613
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,090
Yeah. Besides,

614
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,140
if it weren't for Jiayi,

615
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,860
we couldn't have made any extra money.

616
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,460
Who is it?

617
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,010
- Coming.
- Who is it?

618
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,610
- Mrs. Zhu?
- Jiaxi,

619
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,660
is your mom home?

620
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,090
My mom.

621
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,410
Meixin.

622
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,530
What's wrong now?

623
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:32,890
Big Tang

624
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,170
is gone.

625
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,250
It hasn't

626
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,700
snowed like this in years.

627
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,010
It's colder than ever this year.

628
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,860
Unusual.

629
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,860
They were called back to heaven.

630
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,530
One by one, our last generation has gone.

631
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,300
We used to fight like hell.

632
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,820
Looking back now, it was nothing.

633
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,130
It was just a farce.

634
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,130
We're all losers

635
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,900
in the face of time.

636
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,690
Every generation

637
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,610
has its own task and mission.

638
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,530
Like a soldier,

639
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,490
as long as he's in the army,

640
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,010
he must stand guard well.

641
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,490
That's true.

642
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,450
Watch out.

643
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,650
With our predecessors gone,

644
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,530
the baton is in our hands.

645
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,980
We can only do better

646
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,860
and be more united.

647
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,130
Are you thinking of Jiayi?

648
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,900
Sisters should be open with each other.

649
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,860
At the Spring Festival,

650
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,610
let's give her an out.

651
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,140
It looks good on you.

652
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,790
I want to give you a nickname.

653
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,260
Do I have to take a nickname for this vest?

654
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,260
Because it's good on you.

655
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,090
You should change your name

656
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,330
to He Chang'e.

657
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,260
Is it too early to wear it?

658
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,420
It's not cold enough.

659
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,420
Then wear it when it's cold enough.

660
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,990
Spring Festival.

661
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,940
Wear it for the Spring Festival.

662
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,940
When you go home in this vest,

663
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,460
they'll definitely be stunned.

664
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,130
Fortune's wheel never stands still.

665
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,130
You, He Jiayi,

666
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,340
now have the best life

667
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,900
of your sisters.

668
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,860
Even a blind sparrow won't starve.

669
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,050
After 20 years, it's about time I got lucky.

670
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,890
Yeah.

671
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,010
It's about time we got lucky.

672
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,100
Honey,

673
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,380
I think

674
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,090
it's time for us

675
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,850
to change this house.

676
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,010
- Really?
- Really.

677
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,490
A new house.

678
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,180
Take your pick.

679
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,090
A fowling piece for a big gun!

680
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,490
Big gun!

681
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,460
You can start with a collective enterprise

682
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,050
or a temporary job for transition.

683
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,210
There is always a way.

684
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,690
I hear that the Vegetable Company

685
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,050
and the Soy Sauce Factory

686
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,820
are joining forces to open a shopping mall.

687
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,460
It's the former Huai River Store.

688
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,820
It'll be renamed the May Day Shopping Mall.

689
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,940
But it's still a collective business.

690
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
When it's open, they'll need saleswomen.

691
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,890
After the Spring Festival,

692
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,380
I'll sign you up

693
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,650
and get you in line.

694
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,820
I'm just afraid

695
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,170
that Jiaxi won't be able to do it.

696
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,610
I can do it.

697
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,690
If you can,

698
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,700
how did you end up like this?

699
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,900
But there's no rush.

700
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,860
The earliest will be after the next May Day.

701
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,380
Next year? It takes so long.

702
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,650
If you don't want to stay unemployed,

703
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,530
ask Jiayi

704
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,260
if there's anything you can do

705
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,940
at her Arts and Crafts Factory.

706
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,210
Speaking of Jiayi,

707
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,940
do you want her back for the Festival?

708
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,300
I'll ask Jiawen to visit her.

709
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,860
She's suffered enough

710
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,690
and gone through enough.

711
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,940
We can't let her stay out there.

712
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,890
Jiali,

713
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,050
you should ask her yourself.

714
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,610
Tell her I told her

715
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,300
to bring her son and husband back

716
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,090
on the second day of Chinese New Year.

717
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,260
It's a deal, then.

718
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,530
Come on, guys.

719
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,460
Let's go to the first floor.

720
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,050
The living room, dining room,

721
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,210
and kitchen are on the first floor.

722
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,380
Have a seat. I'll make some tea.

723
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,340
This is the kitchen.

724
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,380
Take a break, Jiayi.

725
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,300
Sit down.

726
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,260
Sit down.

727
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,650
We're relieved

728
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,090
to see you're doing well.

729
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,090
It was hard in the past.

730
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,050
You don't know how much I've suffered.

731
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,700
Now I've finally

732
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,340
got over it.

733
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,090
Who would have

734
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,980
believed it in the past?

735
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,860
I didn't believe I could live a good life.

736
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,260
Now it's all come true.

737
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,900
We all want you back for the Festival.

738
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,650
I'd like to,

739
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,610
but I'm busy.

740
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,820
We've just moved.

741
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,740
Also, Ouyang

742
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,050
has a big family.

743
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,650
Are you still mad at us?

744
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,050
No, not at all.

745
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,420
Anyway, I'll try.

746
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,860
I'll try to go back, ok?

747
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,690
Don't just sit there. Have some tea.

748
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,650
This is good tea imported from Britain.

749
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,970
Here.

750
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,900
(Bankbook)

751
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,740
Jiahuan,

752
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,940
help me figure out how much interest

753
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,610
I can get on this fixed term.

754
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,130
8.32 yuan.

755
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,140
So little?

756
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Many a little

757
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,300
make a mickle.

758
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,860
By the way, Jiahuan,

759
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,260
are you seeing someone in college?

760
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,260
Is that all you think about every day?

761
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,300
It's not my fault.

762
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,610
We're getting to the age.

763
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,460
Jiayi had a baby already.

764
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,940
It will be our turn soon.

765
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,780
Not our,

766
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:12,930
my.

767
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,690
Are you already seeing someone?

768
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,050
I don't like any of my admirers.

769
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,650
You can brag all you want.

770
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,780
It's true.

771
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,650
I don't care.

772
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,490
Anyway, you can't get in front of me.

773
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,210
What do you mean?

774
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,690
I'm your elder sister.

775
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,260
If you're so inactive, it'll be difficult.

776
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,460
Do you want a beating?

777
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,300
Jiahuan, I think

778
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,050
you should put on some make-up.

779
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,860
Jiayi always wears make-up.

780
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,010
Her husband is very charmed by her.

781
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,940
How do you know?

782
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,570
You're away, so you don't know.

783
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,460
But everyone at home

784
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
knows that Ouyang Bao loves his wife.

785
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,210
Many of the things she eats and uses

786
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,530
are from Shanghai.

787
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,050
So rich?

788
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,130
She is wealthy now.

789
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,340
Jiahuan, look.

790
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,260
Pick a color. I'll do your make-up.

791
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,140
No.

792
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,100
Get lost.

793
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,260
Jiahuan, you're in college now.

794
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,460
When Qiulin comes back and sees you,

795
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,300
he'll think you haven't improved at all.

796
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,100
Really?

797
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,690
Jiahuan, you're so fashionable!

798
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,260
Mom, Grandma, does Jiahuan look good?

799
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,820
I'm dim-sighted.

800
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,900
She seems to wear a salted fish on her head.

801
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,300
More like salted meat.

802
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,940
Don't you know what's fashionable?

803
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,010
It's called "wave and stop",

804
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,740
the most popular hairstyle
in China Hong Kong.

805
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,260
Take odd things for granted,

806
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,050
and they are no longer odd.

807
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,210
Jiahuan, don't wear glasses.

808
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,100
They will ruin

809
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,090
the look of your hairstyle.

810
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,820
Do I have to stay like this?

811
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,260
At least a week until the Festival.

812
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,490
Or you'll have wasted your money.

813
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,860
Be careful when you sleep.

814
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,820
What should I do?

815
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,860
You should sleep standing.

816
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,580
(Blessings)

817
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,050
Grandma.

818
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,580
You're back.

819
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,340
Great-grandma, happy New Year!

820
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,210
Happy New Year, Xiaonian.

821
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,170
- Call me.
- Grandma.

822
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,650
I'll get you some candy.

823
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,490
We'll help you.

824
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,370
No need.

825
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,780
Jiali, Jianguo, you're here.

826
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,410
Xiannian.

827
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,890
Come.

828
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,860
Aunts, happy New Year!

829
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Good boy.

830
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,700
Don't move.

831
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,570
I'll put a little makeup on you.

832
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,960
Pretty boy.
