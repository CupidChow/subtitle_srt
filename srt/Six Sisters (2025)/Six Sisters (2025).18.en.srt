Who is it?

16
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,020
Fang Tao. It's Lina.

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,340
What's up?

18
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,820
Open the door.

19
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,980
Let me in and we'll talk.

20
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,100
Fang Tao.

21
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,420
What's the matter?

22
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,100
Let me in.

23
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,380
Say it here.

24
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,620
What else could it be?

25
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,980
It's about us.

26
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,660
What could it be between us?

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,420
Fine, if you think it's ok,

28
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,820
I'll say it here.

29
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,740
- Come in.
- That's more like it.

30
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,900
Anything to eat?

31
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,420
I'm hungry after a long walk.

32
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,020
Who is it?

33
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,260
Me.

34
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,260
What do you mean?

35
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,700
You want me to go to your room

36
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,540
and throw myself at you?

37
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,180
In your dreams!

38
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,420
Jiahuan, I didn't mean that.

39
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,620
My workplace is allocating housing

40
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,700
and I've applied for a unit.

41
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,220
It's a bit small,

42
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,300
but it's furnished.

43
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,260
If you're annoyed with me,

44
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,780
you can move in there.

45
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,740
Who wants to live there?

46
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,700
What Ouyang Bao said is not true.

47
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,780
We have a misunderstanding.

48
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,020
Then let's adopt to it.

49
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,800
What are you doing?

50
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,060
Aren't you afraid that people will know?

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,500
I don't care!

52
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,900
Jiahuan,

53
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,060
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,100
I think the main problem

55
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260
is that we're too different.

56
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,020
I don't think I deserve you.

57
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,780
It's not your call.

58
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,020
It's my call!

59
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,020
Fang Tao, can you be a little confident?

60
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,100
You're not that bad!

61
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,220
I don't think you don't deserve me.

62
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,700
But you must tell me

63
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,060
why your ex-wife came to you again.

64
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,020
- She...
- Is she here to make up with you?

65
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,800
So you were like

66
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,820
a dry faggot on a blazing fire.

67
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,780
When you were in the room,

68
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,700
was your love rekindled?

69
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,540
No!

70
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,420
She just covets my house.

71
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,180
I made it clear to her.

72
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,220
I told her it was never going to happen!

73
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,660
Jiahuan,

74
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,100
if you really accept me,

75
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,860
I'll cook for you for the rest of my life.

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,060
I'm willing to take care of you.

77
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,060
Look what I just ate.

78
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,900
From now on,

79
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,580
I'll never let you eat pickles again.

80
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,780
It's all your fault.

81
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,820
Fang, I'm sorry about last time.

82
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,020
I had a few drinks

83
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,780
and said something wrong.

84
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,780
You've got a great personality.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,180
Let's look out for each other.

86
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,700
We can spend more time together.

87
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,020
- Ok.
- Come.

88
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,220
Bro.

89
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,540
Welcome to join us.

90
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,220
Here comes the fish.

91
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,260
- Here.
- The food is all ready.

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,180
Let's eat, Xiaoling. Time to eat.

93
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,020
Let's eat.

94
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,420
Won't you drink up?

95
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,620
I will.

96
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,180
It's the Lantern Festival today.

97
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,260
Let's welcome Fang Tao to join us.

98
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,860
- Come.
- From now on, you're family.

99
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,380
- Thanks, Jiali, everyone.
- Welcome.

100
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,220
Where is Jianguo?

101
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,140
He's working overtime.

102
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,020
Welcome.

103
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,780
Fang,

104
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,260
you really did a good thing.

105
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,860
Jiahuan

106
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,180
is a bully in the family.

107
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,020
Once you marry her and tame her,

108
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,180
the world will be at peace.

109
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,780
Ouyang, what are you talking about?

110
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,980
You're talking nonsense after a few drinks.

111
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,620
No, no. I've just started drinking.

112
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,580
Fang Tao, I'll drink to you.

113
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,260
- I'll join you.
- Zhenmin.

114
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,860
Only Jiawen is absent.

115
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,580
Why didn't she come?

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,740
Well, Weiguo

117
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,820
and Guangming didn't come either.

118
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,380
Weiguo is also working overtime.

119
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,060
Jiawen went to her mother-in-law's.

120
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,660
Yeah.

121
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,580
Though she didn't come, her care arrived.

122
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,980
She sent a monetary gift, right?

123
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,820
Fang Tao,

124
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,020
it's the holiday. Make a toast.

125
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,980
Grandma, Mom,

126
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,780
thanks for raising a great daughter.

127
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,820
I'd like to recite a poem

128
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,220
to express my feelings right now.

129
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,260
A poem, wow.

130
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,420
Her smile is like a flower

131
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,620
lighting up the road ahead of me.

132
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,540
I will cherish her forever

133
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,220
with all my passion and persistence.

134
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,260
Great!

135
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,100
Good.

136
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,580
Good poem.

137
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,220
- What a poet.
- Come on!

138
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
Happy Lantern Festival!

139
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,900
Welcome!

140
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,180
So talented.

141
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,580
You're good.

142
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,980
You must have read a lot.

143
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,820
I didn't write it.

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,020
Fang Tao, please

145
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,020
take care of Jiahuan from now on.

146
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,980
- Rest assured, Mom.
- Mom.

147
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,340
I'll have to take care of him.

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,660
You take care of each other.

149
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,540
Who cooks filefish for whom?

150
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,420
Jiali!

151
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
By the way, Fang Tao,

152
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,740
I was too harsh last time.

153
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,380
I'll toast you with juice.

154
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,820
No worries. It was a misunderstanding.

155
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm glad I didn't hurt you.

156
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,580
It's ok.

157
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,140
- Come on, Jiahuan.
- I'll drink up.

158
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,980
I'll drink to you, too.

159
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,180
I'll join you.

160
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,620
Xiaoling, I think you'll have a boy.

161
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,780
I think so, too.

162
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,340
Look, the girls in our family

163
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,180
all had boys.

164
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,620
Mom gave birth to all the girls.

165
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,020
It's time for us to have boys.

166
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,180
Hey, you,

167
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,180
do you have to rub it in?

168
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,140
Xiaoling, I've got it.

169
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,420
What took you so long?

170
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,820
Honey,

171
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,540
you wanted breakfast.

172
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,580
It's afternoon.

173
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,980
Where am I supposed to get it?

174
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,740
It shouldn't have taken you so long, though.

175
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Where have you been?

176
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,380
I've been looking all over the alley.

177
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Really. You wanted breakfast.

178
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,340
Where can I get it in the afternoon?

179
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,180
Chicken Soup Porridge?

180
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,420
I couldn't get it.

181
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,540
I only got you fried pies.

182
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,580
I bought them all.

183
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,740
Give me.

184
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,940
Eat while they are hot.

185
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,180
Eat.

186
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,140
Here.

187
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,380
It's ok for me to wait.

188
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,220
The point is,

189
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,300
can our baby wait?

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,420
Sure.

191
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,020
What's the smell?

192
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,500
Did I stain myself with oil?

193
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,220
No, it's perfume.

194
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,060
How can you smell perfume?

195
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Where exactly have you been?

196
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,180
I went to get you food.

197
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,380
No wonder it took you three hours.

198
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,700
Were you dancing in the park?

199
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,620
Absolutely not.

200
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,600
I went to get you food.

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,700
The breakfast spot was closed.

202
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,900
So I checked every place I could find.

203
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,620
Tell me the truth.

204
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,380
I am telling the truth.

205
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
I'm going to my mom's.

206
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,340
Be careful.

207
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,500
Why are you going there?

208
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
To get some food.

209
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,220
There's no food or drink. I'm starving.

210
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,660
Isn't this food?

211
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,340
Liu Xiaoling.

212
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,300
Don't follow me.

213
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,220
Watch your belly.

214
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,420
- Get lost.
- Well.

215
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,980
Mom,

216
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm staying at home tonight.

217
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,140
What's wrong?

218
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,580
He's gone too far.

219
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,220
I put on so much weight

220
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,580
to give him a baby.

221
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,740
I've been suffering every day,

222
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,300
and he's out having fun.

223
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,140
I wanted some Chicken Soup Porridge.

224
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,100
I asked him to get it.

225
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,300
But he kept me waiting for three hours.

226
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,340
You were out for three hours.

227
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,180
What did you do?

228
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,380
Did you go dancing again?

229
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,920
- I'm starving.
- Mom, let me explain.

230
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,220
Chicken Soup Porridge, breakfast, right?

231
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,300
- Where could I get it?
- Alright.

232
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
- I got several Fried Pies.
- Enough.

233
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,620
Then she got mad at me.

234
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,540
Ok, get inside.

235
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,740
You're nothing like an adult.

236
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,140
Liu Xiaoling.

237
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
Alright, Zhenmin.

238
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,940
Go home.

239
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,700
Let her stay here today.

240
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,140
- No.
- Go home.

241
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,180
Come and pick her up tomorrow.

242
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,340
Ok, I'll do as you say.

243
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,380
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

244
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,980
Close the door.

245
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,140
Mom, talk to her.

246
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,420
(Pickles)

247
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,620
Do you think we don't have enough trouble?

248
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,380
Mom, I'm the victim.

249
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,260
You should've beaten him up.

250
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
You can stay here today.

251
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,780
Go home with him tomorrow.

252
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,780
Every little thing happens,

253
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,420
you dash back here.

254
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,220
You've got a family now.

255
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,620
Don't be so impulsive.

256
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,020
What's in it for you

257
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,620
if you piss off your husband?

258
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,020
Liu Xiaoling,

259
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,220
you bear my surname,

260
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,180
but why isn't your temper like mine?

261
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,500
You can't cope with anything.

262
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,460
Well, Mom,

263
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm carrying his baby

264
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
and he's doing this to me.

265
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,580
After I give birth,

266
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,620
who knows how he'll ignore me?

267
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,980
Who is to blame?

268
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,500
Who insisted on marrying him?

269
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,140
It's too late now.

270
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,860
You must follow your husband no matter what.

271
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
I can get a divorce, then.

272
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,900
Liu Xiaoling, do whatever you want

273
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,820
and act unreasonably.

274
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,980
You're going to suffer.

275
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,020
I'm just saying.

276
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,020
You can't say it.

277
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,900
You can't think about it.

278
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,260
Not even a single thought.

279
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,420
Now you are pregnant.

280
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,380
You must be responsible

281
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,260
for everything you say,

282
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,100
understand?

283
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,020
Is it that serious?

284
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,220
Go home tomorrow.

285
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,860
Mom,

286
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,710
I want to eat Chicken Soup Porridge.

287
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,100
I want it so much.

288
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,740
No Chicken Soup Porridge.

289
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,980
I'll make you Egg Drop Soup.

290
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,860
Zhenmin,

291
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,820
apologize to Xiaoling.

292
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,220
Honey,

293
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,820
I apologize to you.

294
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,020
Don't be mad.

295
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,980
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

296
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,100
Xiaoling, he apologized.

297
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,900
Don't be angry.

298
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,500
You have problems, too.

299
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,300
You're a hothead.

300
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,780
She doesn't have any problem.

301
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,860
At this time,

302
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,900
Zhenmin should take good care of her.

303
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,260
Zhenmin is careless

304
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,900
and doesn't think things through.

305
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,020
But, Xiaoling,

306
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,420
I can assure you,

307
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,460
he cares about you.

308
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,340
Do you think

309
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,020
this will work?

310
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,820
I asked Lixia

311
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,420
to take care of you

312
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,060
until you give birth.

313
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,860
There will be no problem.

314
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,060
As for Zhenmin,

315
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,220
I will keep an eye on him.

316
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,940
Are you happy?

317
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,660
You're lucky to have

318
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,780
such a good sister-in-law.

319
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,100
Exactly.

320
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,220
I'm flattered.

321
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,220
Xiaoling may make

322
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,100
a great contribution to our family soon.

323
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,220
Have you checked?

324
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,820
Not really.

325
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,060
But a boy or a girl is equally good.

326
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,620
What about Youmin?

327
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,900
They haven't had a baby.

328
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,700
Mom, Grandma,

329
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,620
I'll take good care of Xiaoling.

330
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,580
Honey,

331
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,170
concentrate on your pregnancy wellness.

332
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,540
Don't be mad at me.

333
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,540
I promise I'll never

334
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,340
go dancing behind your back again.

335
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,340
Dad is also here. Dad,

336
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,300
I won't dance behind Xiaoling's back again.

337
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,700
Honey, don't be mad at me.

338
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,220
- You promise?
- I promise.

339
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,620
Be good to me.

340
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,460
Of course.

341
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,460
(True Love for Life, Blessings)

342
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,940
(Blessings)

343
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,620
Why can't I see anything?

344
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,540
Is the contact lenses' prescription right?

345
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,740
It's right.

346
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,620
They're genuine from Hendry Optical.

347
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,700
Can't you see? Did you wear it backwards?

348
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,700
Did you?

349
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,140
- How about now?
- Ok.

350
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,860
Ok.

351
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,980
You're all married.

352
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,180
I'm getting old.

353
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,020
Jiali.

354
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,660
They're coming.

355
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,420
The groom!

356
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,300
Come on.

357
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,260
The groom is here.

358
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,660
He is coming.

359
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,220
Fang Tao.

360
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,860
- Red packets first!
- Red packets.

361
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,500
Sure, I've got them prepared.

362
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,340
You each have one.

363
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,260
Two.

364
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,500
Give me, Fang Tao.

365
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,340
I'll hand them out for you.

366
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,460
Come in, please.

367
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,780
Come on in.

368
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,900
- Grandma, Mom.
- He's here.

369
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,940
Get in.

370
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
She's waiting for you.

371
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,140
Jiali.

372
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,260
You look sharp.

373
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,140
Jiahuan,

374
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
let's go home.

375
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,300
Slow down.

376
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,020
Come on.

377
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,580
The first car.

378
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,860
Feng.

379
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,500
Watch out.

380
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,980
- Feng, come here.
- Get in the car.

381
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,860
Sit tight.

382
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,660
Which car do I get in?

383
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,940
Be patient.

384
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,140
There's a lot to do. You stay with me.

385
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,300
- Come.
- Jiawen, you guys go first.

386
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,140
Ok.

387
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,180
We'll be there soon.

388
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,020
Ok.

389
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,940
Go ahead.

390
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,460
You didn't cry at Xiaoling's wedding.

391
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,540
What's wrong with you today?

392
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
They got married one by one.

393
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,900
Only the youngest is left with me.

394
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,100
That's the way it should be.

395
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,980
Phone.

396
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,660
Hello.

397
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,620
Mom, is Jiali home with you?

398
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,300
Xiaoling is in labor.

399
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,380
Come to the hospital.

400
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
She did it on purpose.

401
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,980
She always tries to get ahead of me.

402
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,380
She fought with me, like always.

403
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,580
She did it on purpose.

404
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,780
Today is my big day.

405
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,220
I told her not to come,

406
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,060
but she had to.

407
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,580
Now what? She's got us in a big mess.

408
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,500
All our guests

409
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,220
went to watch her give birth.

410
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,900
Not many people went.

411
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,620
Wasn't our wedding lively?

412
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,660
Not at all!

413
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,060
Without the leading role,

414
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,380
what's the point of supporting roles?

415
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,500
You're the leading role.

416
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,780
If it upsets you so much,

417
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,180
we can have one too.

418
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,620
Get out.

419
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,860
It's not that easy to have a baby.

420
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,020
It can be hard

421
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,260
and easy.

422
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,620
If it's so easy,

423
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,660
why haven't you had one

424
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,620
over so many years?

425
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,260
It was my ex-wife's problem.

426
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,060
Who knows if you're lying?

427
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,700
Then I can only

428
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,420
prove it with my strength.

429
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,180
I haven't taken off my contact lenses!

430
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,380
He's asleep.

431
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,460
What's the point?

432
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,220
Getting married, having kids, raising kids,

433
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
getting old, and dying.

434
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,700
That's the whole point of being a woman.

435
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,100
It's so much easier to be a man.

436
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,220
They don't give birth or feed babies.

437
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,210
They don't care about anything.

438
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,220
I'm sure Zhenmin is dancing now.

439
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,100
l don't think he is that kind of man.

440
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,820
He cares about you.

441
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,900
Are you kidding?

442
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,460
I asked him to name our son,

443
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,900
but he hasn't done it yet.

444
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,380
Jiayi, I've realized now

445
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,900
that getting married was a mistake.

446
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,260
Why don't you

447
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,620
give him a name?

448
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,460
I?

449
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,980
I'm not very educated.

450
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,180
As long as it sounds good.

451
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,820
Jiayi,

452
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,020
bring me the music score.

453
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,420
Music score? Which one?

454
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,580
The one on the left.

455
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,220
Will it work?

456
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,740
I'll call him whatever I read.

457
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,420
This one is good.

458
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,860
The sun is shining.

459
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,260
Yangyang, referring to shining.

460
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,340
Ok.

461
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,020
Tang Yangyang.

462
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
Good name.

463
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,780
Xiaoling, I'm home.

464
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,860
You're here, Jiayi.

465
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,060
Your wife needs you to take care of her.

466
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,380
Don't run around.

467
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,580
Stay with her.

468
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,420
Did you hear her?

469
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,620
Yes, I know. You're wrong about me.

470
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,660
I went to get Xiaoling good food.

471
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
What did you buy? Let me see.

472
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,660
Fried Glutinous Rice Bar and Dough Twist.

473
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Luckily I was quick.

474
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,900
This is all that's left.

475
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,380
Xiaoling, take a rest.

476
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,420
I have to go.

477
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,220
Zhenmin,

478
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,460
take care of Xiaoling.

479
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,420
Rest assured, Jiayi.

480
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm leaving.

481
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,660
Tie this up.

482
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,900
Ok.

483
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,220
What are you doing?

484
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
What do you think?

485
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,820
Whose car is this? It's kind of sharp.

486
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,860
It's ours, of course.

487
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,660
- Come.
- Really?

488
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,060
Get in the car.

489
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,700
Do we have a car?

490
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,660
Let's go home.

491
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,460
How do you like it?

492
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,220
Honey, how much is it?

493
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,500
180,000 yuan.

494
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,500
So expensive!

495
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,300
(May Day Shopping Mall)

496
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,300
Give them to your mom.

497
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,700
I don't wear fancy clothes.

498
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,220
Grandma, elderly people

499
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
should wear something colorful.

500
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,860
This is yours.

501
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,660
No, no.

502
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,220
- I'll look like a weirdo in it.
- It's nice!

503
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,660
Summer purchase of winter apparel.

504
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,020
It's a gift from your granddaughter.

505
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,060
Keep it.

506
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Mom, this is yours.

507
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,020
Leather jacket?

508
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,060
Yes.

509
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,420
The leather is good.

510
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,300
And the price is high.

511
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,580
How much?

512
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,380
200?

513
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,740
One more zero.

514
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,900
2000?

515
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,540
- Return it.
- Why?

516
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,060
- I don't want it.
- Too expensive.

517
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,260
I paid for it with my money, not yours.

518
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,580
Still, I don't want to cost you so much.

519
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,780
You've worked hard all your life.

520
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
Why don't you reward yourself?

521
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,660
It's nice. Look!

522
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,180
Return it. Do you have the receipt?

523
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,660
Why do you have to return it?

524
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,820
There are more.

525
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,780
Jiayi,

526
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,980
don't be extravagant

527
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,460
when you are rich.

528
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,940
Always prepare for the worst.

529
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,060
Grandma,

530
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,260
how many good days can you have in life?

531
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,660
If you don't please yourself on good days,

532
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,580
it will be too late for regrets on bad days.

533
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,020
Put on a show when you're given a stage.

534
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,260
Life is art.

535
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,780
Art is life.

536
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,820
Good!

537
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,380
They are all yours.

538
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,540
All of these.

539
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,260
Let me grab a bite. I'm starving.

540
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,940
Where did you learn that? Look at her.

541
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,260
No one listens to us anymore.

542
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,620
We're getting old.

543
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,340
How can you say that in front of me?

544
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,420
I am the old one.

545
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,540
Those who shouldn't be dead were gone,

546
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,020
leaving only us behind,

547
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,980
the ones who should be dead.

548
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Look, here you go again.

549
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,260
Why don't you say something nice?

550
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,980
You're alive for a good reason.

551
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,660
When will Jiahuan give birth?

552
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,340
In two or three months, probably.

553
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,700
You know what,

554
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,060
last night I dreamed

555
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,220
that she had a son.

556
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,660
Really?

557
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,140
Another son?

558
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,580
From your mouth to God's ear.

559
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,340
(Two months later)

560
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,140
(Huainan AH Trust Investment Corporation)

561
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,460
(Time is money.)
Be careful.

562
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,060
(Efficiency is life.)

563
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,340
What would you like to eat today?

564
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,420
Something light.

565
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,660
You're tired of my cooking.

566
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,580
We've been to every restaurant in town.

567
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,180
I don't know what you would like.

568
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,060
- Slowly.
- That's why

569
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,580
I got so heavy.

570
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,060
All women gain weight during pregnancy.

571
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,580
You're much better than others.

572
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,260
Putting on weight hasn't affected your face.

573
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,780
You'll be back in shape after giving birth.

574
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,380
That's why it's hard for women.

575
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,480
Jiahuan,

576
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,060
I know it's hard for you.

577
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,540
You only have to give birth to the baby.

578
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
I'll take care of it.

579
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,460
Hang in there.

580
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,260
You don't know

581
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,980
that some people are trying

582
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,860
to take over my job

583
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,380
while I'm pregnant.

584
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,260
I don't think you'll give it to them.

585
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,580
Even if I give it to them,

586
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,980
are they capable of doing it?

587
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,900
The same job

588
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,340
done by different people

589
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,940
can lead to different results.

590
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,780
Yes.

591
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,500
But don't work so hard.

592
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,900
The company can function without anyone.

593
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,660
Slow down.

594
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,780
You got the point.

595
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,580
It can't function

596
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
without me.

597
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,500
So

598
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,180
I can't let them

599
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,980
take advantage

600
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,020
of my pregnancy.

601
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,900
Sure.

602
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,780
I absolutely support your decision.

603
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,420
So I take you to and from work every day.

604
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,580
Today at the meeting,

605
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,180
Wu pulled a long face.

606
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,380
I'm going to prove to them

607
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,060
that a woman

608
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,140
can take care of both work and family

609
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,580
and can do it well.

610
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,420
Well, well, well.

611
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,140
You're the Iron Lady of our family.

612
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,340
Alright, let's stop talking about work.

613
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,540
Think about what you'd like to eat.

614
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,940
Don't ask me everything, everyday.

615
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,980
You're in charge of our family.

616
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,840
Who else can I ask but you?

617
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,690
Be careful.

618
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,820
Light.

619
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,540
What light food can I get you?

620
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,500
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

621
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,340
Where are you hurt?

622
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,660
- Belly.
- Belly...

623
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,900
Hospital.

624
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,020
You're like your sisters.

625
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,980
None of you gave us any warning.

626
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,620
Jiahuan, hang in there.

627
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,620
Hang in there.

628
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,740
(Huainan AH Trust Investment Corporation)

629
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,580
(Huainan No.1 People's Hospital, Outpatient)

630
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,660
Look.

631
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,180
He looks just like you when you were little.

632
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,980
Thick eyebrows and big eyes.

633
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,020
Mom,

634
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,020
who says that about a little girl?

635
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,060
You looked like a boy when you were little.

636
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,340
Where's Grandma?

637
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,420
Her legs were weak,

638
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,820
so I didn't let her come.

639
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,260
Jiawen isn't well.

640
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,660
Xiaoling has to take care of the baby.

641
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,740
Jiaxi is at work.

642
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,060
After your recovery period

643
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,380
and the baby's first month,

644
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,980
we'll celebrate together.

645
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,540
Jianguo and I will

646
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,300
organize a banquet for you.

647
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,820
Our family is getting bigger

648
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,860
and busier.

649
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,820
Leave these things to us.

650
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,740
We'll pay for Jiahuan's

651
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
celebration banquet.

652
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,420
Nobody's competing with me.

653
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,260
Jinman Restaurant.

654
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,100
Thanks, Jiayi, Ouyang.

655
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,820
After your recovery period,

656
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,860
you should cook once in a while.

657
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,340
You're a mom now.

658
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,980
Don't let Fang do all the housework.

659
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,580
Jiali, cooking is no big deal.

660
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,940
I'm just worried

661
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,420
about Jiahuan's recovery.

662
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,340
I don't have parents

663
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,540
or female relatives.

664
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,860
I know nothing about postnatal recovery.

665
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,980
Jiahuan, I'd like to help you,

666
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,980
but I can't do much.

667
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,140
I'm a light sleeper at night.

668
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,460
Aren't you busy selling pickles?

669
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,380
My daughter and grandson are more important.

670
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,420
It's ok, Jiahuan.

671
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,220
After I gave birth,

672
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,860
there was no one around.

673
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,070
Ouyang was the only one

674
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,620
taking care of me. You'll be fine.

675
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,780
If there's no other way,

676
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,380
I'll ask Qiufang

677
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,580
to see if she can

678
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,220
find someone in Dahebo.

679
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,420
Why do you ask for trouble?

680
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
You can borrow Ms. Liao for a month.

681
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,620
Jiayi,

682
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,940
can you manage without her?

683
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,420
Of course.

684
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,780
I'll pay her salary.

685
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,340
Have you named him?

686
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,580
Yes, before he was born.

687
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
What is it?

688
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,020
Zhicheng.

689
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,220
It means where there's a will, there's a way.

690
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,140
- Be careful.
- Ok.

691
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,220
Give me your hand.

692
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,540
- I'll go up first. It's slippery.
- Ok.

693
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,500
Come.

694
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,100
- Slowly.
- Ok.

695
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,780
Oh, my.

696
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,100
It's here.

697
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,180
Let's sit here.

698
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,860
- Here.
- Ok.

699
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,780
Well, what are we looking at?

700
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,380
There's no sign of the moon.

701
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,340
Be patient.

702
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,740
The forecast calls

703
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,380
for cloudy turning to clear tonight.

704
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,340
Alright.

705
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,700
I miss you.

706
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,460
Seriously?

707
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,980
It wasn't long after we met.

708
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,100
But I feel like it's been a long time.

709
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,340
You wouldn't let me go to your house.

710
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,380
I've waited from day to night.

711
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,900
I didn't make you wait.

712
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,180
Jiaxi.

713
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,140
May I kiss you?

714
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,380
The moon's coming out.

715
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,100
Look, hurry up. Make a wish.

716
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,340
Ok.

717
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Thank you, moon.

718
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,700
Hongyu, do you know what I wished for?

719
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,380
Hongyu.

720
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,820
Hongyu?

721
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,700
Don't scare me.

722
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,220
Yan Hongyu!

723
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,140
Wang.

724
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,940
- Hello.
- What happened?

725
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,100
Did Jiaxi hit him?

726
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,380
Come with me.

727
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,900
She didn't.

728
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,660
When they were dating,

729
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,500
he fell.

730
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,980
Fell?

731
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,580
Where is Jiaxi?

732
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,740
She went to work.

733
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,580
Then why did you ask me to come?

734
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,460
You've seen

735
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,900
what's happening here.

736
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,900
What's happening here?

737
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,700
The kids.

738
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,940
What about them?

739
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,580
A good thing is happening.

740
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,100
Can't you tell?

741
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,180
Hongyu and Jiaxi.

742
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,900
A seed is dropped

743
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
and a sprout grows.

744
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,940
They've fallen in love.

745
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,340
Wang,

746
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,740
I asked Jiaxi to be your apprentice,

747
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,500
not your daughter-in-law.

748
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,220
Jiali, I'll tell you what,

749
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,060
you shouldn't blame me for this.

750
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,460
I tried to stop them,

751
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,260
but they are in free love.

752
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,740
There's nothing I could do.

753
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,180
No, definitely not.

754
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,460
Don't be so authoritarian,

755
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,300
I'm telling you.

756
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
We must not

757
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,980
break them up.

758
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,940
Ok.

759
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,460
Thanks.

760
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540
Here's your change.

761
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,380
Ok.

762
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,540
Mom, you knew about this already.

763
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,900
Why didn't you tell me?

764
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,700
I forgot.

765
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,540
There's so much going on in the family.

766
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,260
I have to worry about Xiaoling,

767
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,100
Jiahuan,

768
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,180
and Jiawen.

769
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,660
I've got a lot on my mind.

770
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,380
Besides, Jiaxi is still young.

771
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,260
It's not going that fast.

772
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,420
I warned her.

773
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,260
Not that fast?

774
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,580
You know what,

775
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,900
they're on their last leg.

776
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,300
Wang Huaimin is a mean woman.

777
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,100
How can you marry Jiaxi to her son?

778
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,700
She's like a hornet's nest.

779
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,300
You'll get stung if you get close to her.

780
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,180
We're even in-laws with the Tangs.

781
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,540
Why are we afraid of her?

782
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,900
Don't oppose it so fiercely this time.

783
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,340
Like the last two times,

784
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,620
the more you opposed it,

785
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
the more you pushed them together.

786
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,380
Did Jiaxi tell you anything?

787
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,580
No.

788
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,740
No one told me anything.

789
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,340
Didn't you just tell me that?

790
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,300
Let's talk about it at home, ok?

791
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,620
I've got business to do.

792
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,460
In the final analysis,

793
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,140
it's your and Jianguo's fault.

794
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,540
Why don't you care about her?

795
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,140
It's time to date once she has a job.

796
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,460
You know many young officers.

797
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,780
Set her up with them.

798
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,580
Mom, I set her up with them.

799
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,500
But she wouldn't see them.

800
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,620
An elder sister is like a mom.

801
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,180
But you're her mom!

802
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,340
Go home.

803
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,740
You've pissed off the God of Wealth.

804
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,900
Hello, Mrs. He.

805
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,460
You're...

806
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,860
I'm Jiali's colleague

807
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,380
from the Commerce Bureau.

808
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,540
Jiali's colleague?

809
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,340
Sit down, please.

810
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,540
I've known Meixin

811
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,660
for a long time.

812
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,780
We came to Huainan together.

813
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,060
Mrs. He, it's me.

814
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,700
Don't you recognize me?

815
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,500
I tend to be a bit forgetful.

816
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,020
I don't recall.

817
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,620
Xinhuai Village, Wang Huaimin.

818
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,500
I kind of remember.

819
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,020
Remember, huh?

820
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,340
Are you here to see Jiali

821
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,260
or Meixin?

822
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I came to see you.

823
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,300
I'm here for something big,

824
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,180
something happy.

825
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,740
Something happy?

826
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,140
Mrs. He, congratulations.

827
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,020
Why?

828
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,140
As an old woman,

829
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,340
what happy thing can I have?

830
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,660
Look,

831
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,260
your youngest granddaughter,

832
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,300
Jiaxi, has a happy thing.

833
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,500
It's just like you have a happy thing.

834
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,900
Jiaxi and

835
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,460
Hongyu, my son,

836
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,540
fell for each other at first sight.

837
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,660
They're in free love.

838
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,860
They're just fooling around.

839
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,100
Don't take it seriously.

840
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,340
No.

841
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,540
They are taking it seriously,

842
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
not fooling around.

843
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,340
I'm here

844
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,340
to propose to Jiaxi.

845
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,740
As Hongyu's mom,

846
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,340
I heartily agree.

847
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,340
If that's the case,

848
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,540
you're not the only one

849
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,340
who has to agree to it,

850
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,660
right?

851
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,820
Yeah, of course.

852
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,100
It only works out if both families

853
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,500
are happy with it, right?

854
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,500
I see.

855
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,100
When they get back,

856
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,620
I'll tell them.

857
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,500
We will

858
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,460
discuss it and have a meeting.

859
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,620
Have a meeting?

860
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,900
It's like an underground organization.

861
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,780
What did you say?

862
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,260
Mrs. He, look.

863
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,660
It's my first time to visit you

864
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,940
and I don't know what to buy.

865
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,020
This is a small token of my regard.

866
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,940
Please take it.

867
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,460
I can't take the money.

868
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,100
I'm not in charge of the family.

869
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,140
Take it.

870
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,660
- No.
- Do take it.

871
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,740
If you keep this up,

872
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,140
I won't let you in again.

873
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,700
Well...

874
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,140
Bye.

875
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,420
Get me some pickles.

876
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,700
Wang!

877
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,980
Eight Pickled Vegetables, huh?

878
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,540
- This.
- Ok.

879
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,860
Ok.

880
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,020
- Anything else?
- Pepper.

881
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,260
Ok. Ok.

882
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,220
Come on.

883
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,300
Done.

884
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,780
Ok.

885
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,140
Here you are. Free of charge.

886
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,860
Meixin, don't do this.

887
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
It's a horse of another color.

888
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,820
If you do this...

889
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,300
No, if you do this, I won't come again.

890
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,020
- Take it.
- Ok.

891
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,260
I'll take your money.

892
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,140
Thanks.

893
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,780
Meixin.

894
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,780
Do you remember,

895
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,980
when we came to Huainan together,

896
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,500
Hu, the blind guy, told us our fortunes.

897
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,980
Hu said we were sisters

898
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,300
in our last life,

899
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
and we could become relatives in this life.

900
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,260
The blind guy, the fortune teller?

901
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,380
You can't believe what he said.

902
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,220
I'm telling you,

903
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,820
it's true.

904
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,780
You have to believe it.

905
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,980
We will

906
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,340
become relatives.

907
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,420
What do you mean?

908
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,980
Don't you know?

909
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,500
Hongyu, my son,

910
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,100
is dating Jiaxi, your daughter.

911
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,060
I'm telling you,

912
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,220
as their moms, we must be supportive.

913
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,700
You must take the money.

914
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
Consider it a deposit.

915
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,820
- No.
- It's a deposit.

916
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,260
- No, no.
- Take it.

917
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,140
You know what,

918
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,380
it's settled.

919
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,220
No, no.

920
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
- It's settled.
- It's not right.

921
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,620
- Settled. It's settled.
- Wang!

922
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,180
- Don't change your mind.
- Wang!

923
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,700
- Wang.
- Settled.
