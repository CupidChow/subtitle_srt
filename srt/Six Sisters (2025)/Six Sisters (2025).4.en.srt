Hit it! Hit it!

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,710
It's going down.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
What's wrong?

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,120
A rat.

20
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,360
What's so scary about a rat?

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,600
It's not just any rat.
It's big, like a little piglet.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,380
Even if it's a pig, I'll take it down.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Where is it?

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,760
Over there.

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,500
Give me the basin.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,710
Be careful.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
Run!

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Run!

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Caught it.

30
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,990
Caught it?

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Nice!

32
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,870
Really?

33
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,280
She really caught it.

34
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,740
This land should be
about five to six mu.

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,810
(Growing in the vast land)

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,160
We were even planning to go
to the orchard this afternoon.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
Can we finish it before that?

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,870
Probably not.

39
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,560
This is too challenging.

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
Well, don't rest now.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Let's get to work.

42
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,430
Do as much as we can.

43
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,270
How about

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,590
we form teams?

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Two to three people per team.

46
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,590
One team will hoe the land here,

47
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,120
and the other will go to the orchard.

48
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,680
Then we'll switch.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,980
This way, we can avoid
doing the same work for too long.

50
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Good idea.

51
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
But

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,470
how do we divide the teams?

53
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,470
Well, how about the three of us girls

54
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,910
form one team to go to the orchard?

55
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,820
I think

56
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,590
it should be a mix of men and women,

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,660
so it's not too tiring.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
How about the two of us as a team?

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,150
Then I'll team up with He Jiali.

60
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,470
We'll stay to hoe the land first.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,680
Alright. Then let's team up.

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
We'll go pick fruit first.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Okay, we'll switch later.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,190
- Okay, see you later.
- Bye.

65
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,030
Okay.

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,870
I didn't agree to team up with you.

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,000
Do we need that?

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,520
We're naturally a team (couple).

69
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,080
Don't talk nonsense.

70
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm talking about the working team.

71
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,430
So am I.

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,750
As my teammate, you can't slack off.

73
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,990
Mom,

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,470
it's windy.

75
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,150
I'll sit with you
for a few more minutes.

76
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,080
Then let's go inside.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280
Since Jiali left,

78
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,430
I've felt empty inside.

79
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,990
Meixin,

80
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,270
I want to visit my hometown.

81
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,560
Why the sudden urge to visit?

82
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,720
It's been so many years.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,750
I should go back and take a look.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
When I left back then,

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,390
I handed everything over

86
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,680
to my younger sister.

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,360
I don't even know
how she's been these years.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,190
Back when I was running

89
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,160
around Beijing and Shanghai
with your father,

90
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,060
Changsheng was looked after

91
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,310
by my younger sister for many years.

92
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,750
She's not in good health.

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,480
I want to go back and see her.

94
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,560
Alright, Mom.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,360
If you want to go back, go ahead.

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,270
Everything is stable now,

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,310
so it's the perfect time to relax.

98
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,720
Look.

99
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,720
I want to go back,
but I'm still worried about the kids.

100
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,560
It's fine.

101
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,260
Ms. Liu and the others
can help with that.

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Don't worry.

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,510
Just go back.

104
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,120
You can come back soon

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,070
in two or three months.

106
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,310
Don't worry. Just go.

107
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,870
It's so itchy.

108
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,270
I'm back.

109
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't move.
Didn't I tell you not to scratch?

110
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,910
I didn't scratch.

111
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,370
You even nicked yourself.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,560
What's this?

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
A folk remedy.

114
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,680
Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,520
Don't move.

116
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,790
It hurts.

117
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,600
It stings a little.

118
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,190
This is wild mint.

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
It'll heal soon.

120
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,870
You know quite a lot.

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:20,420
(January 1970)

122
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,680
No. 14 Beitou Alley.

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,950
You have a letter, No. 14 Beitou Alley.

124
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,940
(He Jiayi, He's third daughter)

125
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,860
(Fortune)

126
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,510
Dad, a letter.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
Whose letter?

128
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Jiali's.

129
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,720
Let's see if she mentioned

130
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,310
when she plans to come back.

131
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,680
It's almost the Chinese New Year.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,630
She won't be back for the Chinese New Year.

133
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,120
Jiawen, read the letter.

134
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,180
(He Jiawen, He's second daughter)

135
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,430
Dear Dad, Mom,

136
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,120
and my sisters,

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,390
I'm doing fine in Feixi.

138
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,800
(Don't worry.)

139
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,630
(I work during the day
to earn work points)

140
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,360
(and help the locals at night.)

141
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,160
(I've basically adapted to rural life.)

142
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,950
(I won't be back for the Chinese New Year,)

143
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,430
(but I'll find a chance
to visit you next year.)

144
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,560
(He Jiahuan, He's fourth daughter)
(From Jiali, January 1970.)

145
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,350
Jiali.

146
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,600
Why are you here?

147
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Here.

148
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,390
Let me help you wear it.

149
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,630
How is it? Does it fit?

150
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,230
It fits quite well.

151
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Good.

152
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,520
You didn't go to pay New Year visits?

153
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
My family sent some things.

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
I thought you might like them.

155
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,360
Look.

156
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,500
There are even soybean cakes.

157
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,030
Wow, there are so many.

158
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,200
Mrs. Tang really cares about you.

159
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,440
Then I won't be polite.

160
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,790
Of course.

161
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,600
Why didn't you go
to the villager's house?

162
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
I had something to do.

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
What's that?

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,840
I'm weaving something.

165
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,270
But you're bad at that.

166
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,630
What are you weaving? Let me see.

167
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
No.

168
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,910
It's too ugly to show me?

169
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,910
Tang Weimin.

170
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,840
Come here.

171
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,200
Take a look. Is it ugly?

172
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,630
This is for me?

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,440
I opened the gloves sent from home

174
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,870
and added some more yarn.

175
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,790
I've been knitting
for such a long time

176
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,840
that my hands are sore.

177
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,840
Let me rub them for you.

178
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
No need.

179
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,220
Try it on.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,160
Alright.

181
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,870
How does it look?

182
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,670
It seems a bit short.

183
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,240
Will it keep the wind out?

184
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,870
It's warm.

185
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,240
It warms my heart.

186
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,670
But this color makes you
look a bit dark.

187
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,240
It's not the scarf's fault.

188
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm glad you like it.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,370
Are you talking about the scarf?

190
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm talking about me.

191
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,910
Who likes you?

192
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,180
(Wishing you good health)

193
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,180
(Ward)

194
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Meixin.

195
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,710
Ms. Liu.

196
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,240
You're here! Come on.

197
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't move.

198
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,270
- Don't move.
- It's fine.

199
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,440
Have a seat.

200
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Sit.

201
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,720
Have an orange.

202
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,200
How's it going?

203
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,790
It comes and goes.

204
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm used to it.

205
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,510
You know,

206
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,270
if that boy had survived back then...

207
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't think too much.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,510
It was fate, right?

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes.

210
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,840
Heaven doesn't disappoint
those who try hard.

211
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,080
Let me do it. Let me.

212
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,120
Here, try it.

213
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,510
How's it?

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,560
It's sweet.

215
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,510
Try another one.

216
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,600
Something's off.

217
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,150
Alright, I'll go.

218
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,790
Doctor, doctor!

219
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,670
(Operating)
Liu Meixin's family.

220
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,590
The baby's head is too large,

221
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,960
and the mother is weak now.

222
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
What?

223
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,320
What do you mean?

224
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,650
The baby's head is too large.

225
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,630
Even forceps can't help get it out.

226
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,980
How's the mother now?

227
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,080
She's lost too much blood.

228
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,150
We need to be quick.

229
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,220
She needs a C-section.

230
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,600
- OK.
- You should discuss it.

231
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Hurry and decide.

232
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,510
C-section?

233
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,390
Just sign it.

234
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,270
Will this work?

235
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,960
What do you mean? It has to work.

236
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,390
If you don't sign, she could die. Hurry!

237
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,510
I'll sign.

238
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,510
Hurry up.

239
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,980
(Informed Consent for C-section)

240
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,360
Doctor, please help her.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,150
Alright, alright.

242
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,960
(Operating)

243
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,150
Sit there and wait.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Don't worry.

245
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,710
Changsheng,

246
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,550
a C-section sounds scary,

247
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,600
but it's not that bad.

248
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,000
Listen, a lot of people
get C-sections now.

249
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,840
That accountant at our workplace

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,960
had one.

251
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,320
She recovered really quickly.

252
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
When this is over,

253
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,000
let her eat some northern snakehead,

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
and the wound will heal fast.

255
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,410
You haven't eaten yet, right?

256
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,630
Here.

257
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,350
Have an egg.

258
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,320
What was the baby in its former life?

259
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,320
Does it want to kill its mother?

260
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,600
Don't talk nonsense.

261
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,910
Meixin is a lucky person.
She'll be fine.

262
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,100
Just eat and don't talk.

263
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,040
Hurry up.

264
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,300
(Labor Ward)

265
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,440
What if

266
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,320
the surgery doesn't succeed?

267
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,510
What if something happens to Meixin?

268
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,320
Look at yourself.

269
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,840
Do you even look like a man now?

270
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,510
You're even crying now.

271
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,550
What if...

272
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,480
Nothing will happen.

273
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,030
Stop talking.

274
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
(Operating)

275
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,200
Liu Meixin's family.

276
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,590
It's a girl.

277
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,790
How's the mother?

278
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,150
The mother and daughter are safe.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,320
I knew Meixin would be fine.

280
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,650
The mother and daughter are safe.
Did you hear that?

281
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,200
What did she say she gave birth to?

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,840
Come on.

283
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,180
(For the people; Cafeteria)

284
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,630
He, congratulations.

285
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,200
You have five daughters now.

286
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,910
Changsheng will be blessed
when he grows old.

287
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,320
What do you mean?

288
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,160
What does that mean?

289
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
His sons-in-law

290
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,320
will fight to take care of him.

291
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,290
Right.

292
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Right.

293
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,080
The more sons-in-law,

294
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,920
the more blessings.

295
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,140
(For the people; Cafeteria)

296
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,000
Talk properly at home.

297
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,480
With Dad's mindset

298
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,200
and Mom's personality,

299
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,550
whenever a new sister is born,

300
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,990
it feels like there's an earthquake.

301
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,030
Your family can't do without you.

302
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,510
Your family too,

303
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,000
especially your dad.

304
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,440
He keeps making things worse.
So annoying.

305
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,200
My dad's opinion is outdated.

306
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,270
Besides,

307
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,240
what's there to resolve

308
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,840
between our two families?

309
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,730
There's nothing to resolve, huh?

310
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,660
Give me my bag.
I don't want you to carry it.

311
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,750
Fine. I'll resolve it.

312
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,840
I'll think of something.

313
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,440
You have to.

314
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,080
I really don't know

315
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,030
how to talk to my family about us.

316
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,630
The future is bright,

317
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,670
but the road is winding.

318
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,710
We'll find a way.

319
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,910
You're quite optimistic.

320
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,750
Captain, thank you.

321
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,000
- You're here.
- Captain.

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,910
You're welcome.

323
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,240
Well, I'm leaving now.

324
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,630
Safe travels.

325
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,830
Sit tight.

326
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,310
- Be careful.
- Okay, slowly.

327
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,380
Are you cold?

328
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,450
Do you need the scarf?

329
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,110
I have gloves.

330
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,920
I'll pick you up when you're back.

331
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,480
Jiali,

332
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,510
is farm work tiring?

333
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,880
Is there anything fun to do?

334
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,070
That's farm work.

335
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,590
What's fun about working?

336
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Dad, Jiali's back.

337
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,030
Dad's back.

338
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,040
Jiali.

339
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,830
Why did you come back?

340
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,440
I just came to have a look.

341
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Grandma said I should help more at home.

342
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,240
You're cooking now?

343
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,320
Yes.

344
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,400
You've learned to cook?

345
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,640
Good for you.

346
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,790
Wait to eat the meal I make.

347
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,680
Do you need any help?

348
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,830
No need.

349
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Good girl.

350
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
Dad,

351
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,880
my little sister looks so much like you.

352
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,030
Look at her eyes and nose.

353
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,480
Hold her.

354
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,480
I won't.

355
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,320
I...

356
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
If I do, she'll cry.

357
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,200
Just hold her.

358
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,830
She's not crying.

359
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,590
How nice. I'll go wash her diaper.

360
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,240
Look at her big head.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,640
Look, it's not squashed at all.

362
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,640
Yes, she looks great.

363
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,040
Dad,

364
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,310
she doesn't have a name yet.

365
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,240
Give her one.

366
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,510
I can't think of one.

367
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,480
What do you mean?

368
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
Can't think of one?

369
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,920
Can't think of one, huh?

370
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,410
Then let her take my surname.

371
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,940
She can take your surname if you want.

372
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,810
What's the big deal?

373
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,720
She'll take my surname.

374
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,560
She'll be a Liu.

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,840
She's Liu Xiaoling.

376
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,640
Mom, if she's Liu Xiaoling,

377
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,310
does that still count as my sister?

378
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,640
Remember:

379
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,480
Liu Xiaoling is your real sister.

380
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,670
Got it?

381
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,510
I'll sleep with Jiali tonight.

382
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,030
I'll sleep in the middle.

383
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,110
Alright, alright.

384
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,270
Don't make a fuss.

385
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,030
Jiali will sleep here.

386
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,110
Dad,

387
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,480
I want to buy some pork ribs
tomorrow morning

388
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
and make soup for Mom

389
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,320
to help her recover.

390
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,310
Did you go to work or to learn to cook

391
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,830
in the countryside?

392
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,030
You can even make soup now?

393
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,510
I wouldn't say I can make it.

394
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,720
I just learned a little.

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,510
Jiali, I heard that.

396
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,720
There will be meat tomorrow.

397
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,400
We'll have to ask Dad
if there are any extra meat coupons.

398
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,030
Only then can I buy more meat.

399
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Dad, just buy some meat.

400
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
I don't want lean meat.

401
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,920
Fat meat is better.

402
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,030
You're not stupid.

403
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,720
Who doesn't know fat meat smells good?

404
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,920
The coupons are with your mom.

405
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,980
You can ask her for them.

406
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,830
Alright.

407
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,680
Is this blanket enough to warm you?

408
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,000
I won't get cold,

409
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,510
but isn't this your blanket?

410
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,640
What will you use?

411
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,270
I'm going to work the night shift.

412
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
You should go to sleep.

413
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,590
- Okay.
- Tidy up and sleep.

414
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,310
What time is it?

415
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,750
You didn't even call me.

416
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,510
Jiali, your snoring is so loud.

417
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,400
How could we call you?

418
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,640
I don't snore.

419
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,640
We were too noisy last night,

420
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,260
so I wanted you to rest a little longer.

421
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,160
Where's Mom? I need to get meat coupons.

422
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,680
I wonder if the market

423
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,110
still has meat at this hour.

424
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,640
Mom seems

425
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,330
to have left early.

426
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,550
Why do I feel so uneasy?

427
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720
Jiali, what are you worried about?

428
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,000
Where's Jiahuan?

429
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,270
She usually runs to eat the fastest.

430
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,590
Jiahuan.

431
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,240
Where did you go?

432
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,960
What's that?

433
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Why throw it around?

434
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
Where did this paper come from?

435
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,160
It's from Mom's pillow.

436
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,960
Meixin, hello.

437
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,310
I heard you recently had another girl.

438
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,960
I've been married here for several years

439
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,240
but still haven't had children.

440
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,550
If it's allowed,
could you take the child to Nanjing?

441
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
Let's discuss it.

442
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,400
Just give her away.

443
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,030
Oh, no.

444
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,960
Jiali, where are you going?

445
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,270
Jiawen, take care of them.

446
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,540
(Nanjing)

447
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,700
(Exit)

448
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,200
Take out the ticket.

449
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,040
Take out the ticket!

450
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,920
Ticket, ticket!

451
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,560
Meixin,

452
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,640
your child is so beautiful.

453
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,670
Ticket.

454
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,110
Take out your ticket.

455
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,540
(Long live the great
Communist Party of China)

456
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,500
(Long live the unity
of the world's people)

457
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,350
(Long live
the People's Republic of China)

458
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,510
My child's head

459
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,350
is a bit flat here.

460
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
When she sleeps, turn her head often.

461
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,600
Don't let her head shape turn out badly.

462
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,750
Meixin, don't worry.

463
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,240
We're relatives.

464
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll take good care of her.

465
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,440
Besides, I've been
married here for years,

466
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,160
but I just couldn't get pregnant.

467
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
If I don't find a child to raise,

468
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,960
I won't have a place here.

469
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,310
How about I hold her for a bit?

470
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,160
Alright.

471
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,750
Make sure to give her

472
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,030
lots of rice soup

473
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
and milk.

474
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,200
- Alright.
- She can be a bit fussy at night.

475
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,310
Oh, I know. Let me try.

476
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,400
Be careful.

477
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,000
So cute.

478
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,780
When you're holding her,

479
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,760
make sure to support her.

480
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,550
- Let me soothe her.
- She feels a bit heavy.

481
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,480
Your hand needs to support her here.

482
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,830
You have to remember that.

483
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,790
Gently sway her,

484
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,400
like swaying a small boat.

485
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,750
Meixin, let me try again.

486
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,110
Let me try again.

487
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,550
Come on.

488
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,870
Little darling.

489
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,200
Meixin, it suddenly occurs to me
I have to go now.

490
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,550
I'll leave now. Okay.

491
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,830
Don't let her catch a cold.

492
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,750
Alright, you can relax.

493
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,670
- Relax.
- Be careful.

494
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,200
Alright, don't worry.

495
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,160
Take it slow.

496
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,870
Mom.

497
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,840
Wait.

498
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,560
I'm sorry,

499
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,200
but I'll have to take care

500
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,110
of this child myself.

501
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,190
Sorry.

502
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,110
- Meixin...
- I'll write to you later.

503
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,510
Haven't we agreed to this?

504
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,830
Does Dad know?

505
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,160
He doesn't want her anyway.

506
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,790
Dad's just playing tough.

507
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,200
Isn't a girl also human?

508
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,750
Isn't she a life?

509
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,920
Don't say that.

510
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,590
I know it's my fault.

511
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,350
Luckily, you stopped in time.

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,070
In the end,

514
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,640
I couldn't bear to part with you.

515
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,040
Mom,

516
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,280
don't worry.

517
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,680
I won't tell anyone

518
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
about this.

519
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,510
It'll be our secret.

520
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,310
But you have to promise me one thing:

521
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,790
If we have...

522
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,680
I mean if.

523
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,000
If we have another sister in the future,

524
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,180
you can't send her away.

525
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,350
You can't abandon her.

526
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,200
If you don't want to raise her,

527
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,200
I will.

528
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,440
You're making me sound
like a bad person,

529
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,590
unfit to be a mother.

530
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,350
Mom,

531
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,200
you're really great.

532
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,110
Am I?

533
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,400
Your dad doesn't think so.

534
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,920
That's because he doesn't see it.

535
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,720
You've created

536
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,070
several successors for socialism.

537
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,440
What use is that?

538
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,240
The He family will die out.

539
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,160
There won't even be anyone
to visit the tomb.

540
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,030
How can the family die out?

541
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
Well,

542
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,590
the kids I have in the future

543
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,310
will carry the He surname.

544
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,750
No matter if it's a boy or a girl.

545
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,030
You can't control that.

546
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,160
Who knows who you'll marry?

547
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,040
Right?

548
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,010
Mom,

549
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,550
Dad doesn't like Xiaoling

550
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,110
not just because she's a girl.

551
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,310
He feels bad for you.

552
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,790
You had a C-section for Xiaoling.

553
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,200
You were nearly gone.

554
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,430
He feels bad.

555
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,350
I told you.

556
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,720
Don't work right after the confinement.

557
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
With all the smoke,

558
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,960
it might damage your eyes.

559
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,930
Why does a man like you know this?

560
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,030
After having so many kids,

561
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,160
I've learned.

562
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,510
Go, go, go.

563
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,160
You should rest over there.

564
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,750
You're stir-frying potatoes, right?

565
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,590
Are you not mad at me?

566
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,350
When the couple is united,

567
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,030
nothing is impossible.

568
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,270
That's too exaggerated.

569
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,590
This is how it is for life.

570
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,310
Anyway, I'm the eternal sinner
in your family.

571
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,510
Who dares say that?

572
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,960
You're our family's hero.

573
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,790
Let's change Xiaoling's surname
back to He

574
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,510
to ease your mind.

575
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,480
No.

576
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Liu Xiaoling

577
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,830
sounds pretty good.

578
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,750
Having a child with your surname

579
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,040
sounds nice.

580
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,310
This time I really have to thank Jiali.

581
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,030
She's grown up

582
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,740
and become a big girl now.

583
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,590
Since she came back,

584
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,640
has she told you anything?

585
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,400
She didn't talk much
about the countryside.

586
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,070
But she did say

587
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,160
if she has kids in the future,

588
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,960
whether it's a girl or a boy,

589
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,020
they'll carry the He surname.

590
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,510
She said that?

591
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,070
Your mom is really great.

592
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,340
How many girls
do you have in your family?

593
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,680
Including me, we have five.

594
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,640
Which one are you?

595
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,790
I'm the eldest, of course.

596
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,070
The eldest worries the most.

597
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,000
Captain, thank you.

598
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,840
It's okay.

599
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,420
- Weimin's here.
- Thanks, Captain.

600
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,030
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

601
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,880
- Bye.
- Thanks.

602
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,000
- Bye.
- Bye, Ms. Cuiying.

603
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,000
What are you doing here?

604
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,560
I've been waiting for you.
I thought you wouldn't come back.

605
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,160
If so, someone will take care of me.

606
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,210
No need for you to manage.

607
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,050
Give it to me.

608
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,110
No need. I'm not some pampered lady,

609
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,950
I can handle it.

610
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,790
I know you're a revolutionary woman,

611
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,000
but you've had a hard journey.

612
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,510
So, how's everything at home?

613
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,390
It's going fine.

614
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,420
(A few months later)

615
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,510
This opportunity is rare.

616
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,870
I have to go with the publicity team
to Shou County and Feixi

617
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,430
for struggle-criticism-transformation.

618
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,720
If you want to go, just go.

619
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,960
What about the kids?

620
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,310
Xiaoling is still so small.

621
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,450
It'll take only a few days.

622
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,510
It's just in Feixi.

623
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,550
I thought I could take the chance

624
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,640
to visit Jiali.

625
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,720
Her birthday is coming up.

626
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
She's alone in the countryside.

627
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,750
I don't know
how to celebrate her birthday.

628
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,240
Don't always come
to the girls' dormitory.

629
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,590
It's not appropriate.

630
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,550
Tomorrow is a special day.

631
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,800
What's going on?

632
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,350
Wait a minute.

633
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,350
Comrade He, happy birthday.

634
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,400
What do you mean?

635
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,310
Why give me a rabbit?

636
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,350
The rabbit's tail doesn't grow long.

637
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,000
That's not what I meant.

638
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,640
It's your birthday,

639
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,310
so I'm giving you a Moon rabbit.

640
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,720
I'm not Chang'e.

641
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,440
Besides, it's a gray rabbit.

642
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,750
There aren't any white rabbits
in the fields.

643
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,350
Well, let's cook it later.

644
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,350
How can you eat rabbits?

645
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,650
What's wrong with rabbits?

646
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,750
It's healthy and hygienic,
much better than rats.

647
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,350
You should be more virtuous.

648
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'll release it later.

649
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,350
What about your birthday then?

650
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,190
I'll skip it.

651
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,240
That won't do.

652
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,190
This year is special.

653
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,550
What's special about it?

654
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,590
It's your first birthday
I'm spending with you.

655
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,800
If you like, we can also do that.

656
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,150
Do that? With who?

657
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,840
I can cooperate.

658
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,190
Annoying.

659
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,630
Are you serious?

660
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,870
Go away.

661
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,190
Tang Weimin, are you okay?

662
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,710
Something's wrong.

663
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
Something's wrong.

664
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,760
Something's wrong? Cut it out.

665
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,020
See you in the fields tomorrow.

666
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,920
You're really leaving?
Leaving me behind?

667
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,070
Jiali.

668
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,320
Comrade, where is
the educated youth office?

669
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,610
Turn right at the intersection.

670
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,450
Turn right?

671
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,030
Comrade.

672
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,510
Excuse me.

673
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm looking for He Jiali.

674
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,240
Is she here?

675
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
She went to the fields.

676
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
She'll be back soon.

677
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,800
Who are you?

678
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,880
I'm her mother.

679
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,200
Hello, Mrs. He.

680
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,320
Come on.

681
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,390
Please, sit down.

682
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,320
Sure. Is the field far away?

683
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,190
It's not far. Please rest.

684
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,280
She'll be back soon.

685
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,480
- Okay.
- Come on.

686
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,350
Thank you. I'll do it myself.

687
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,550
You hurt your foot?

688
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,710
It's sprained,
so I can't go to the fields.

689
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,840
What's your name?

690
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,860
You can call me Huang.
I'm an educated youth.

691
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,190
Is there any water?
I'm a bit thirsty after walking.

692
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,430
Yes, yes.

693
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,000
Your hairpin is lovely.

694
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,590
Yes.

695
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,590
Jiali's birthday is coming up,

696
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,670
so I bought her a hairpin

697
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,440
as a birthday gift.

698
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,840
I'll get the water for you.

699
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,960
Thank you.

700
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,670
Mrs. He, sorry, we're out of water.

701
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,590
I'll go get some more.

702
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,840
No, no, no need.

703
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,150
Huang, no need.

704
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,590
I'll go myself.

705
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,400
- It's okay.
- It's inconvenient for you.

706
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,960
Just tell me where it is.

707
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,190
It's by the haystack.

708
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,960
I'll go. You rest here.

709
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,800
Thank you, Mrs. He.

710
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,840
Huang.

711
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
Well...

712
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,190
Sorry, sorry.

713
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,720
Thanks.

714
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,370
You're really not
celebrating your birthday?

715
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,440
No, I'm not.

716
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,360
How about

717
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,760
I go to Ms. Cuiying's house

718
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,840
and get her chicken...

719
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,150
Don't steal her chicken.

720
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,430
Is it cold?

721
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,070
Yes.

722
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,430
What's wrong?

723
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,800
I think someone's here.

724
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,190
I don't think so.

725
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,280
It could be a rabbit.

726
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,880
The one I gave you yesterday?

727
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,110
I already let that one go.

728
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,840
Who dropped this hairpin?

729
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,820
It's quite nice.

730
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,680
I'll ask around.

731
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,350
Jiali, your mom's here.

732
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,480
She even helped us get water.

733
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,320
My mom?

734
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,590
Mom, why are you here?

735
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,730
Is something wrong at home?

736
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,980
There's nothing wrong at home.

737
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,230
Sit down. Let's talk.

738
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,690
Did you just get back from the fields?

739
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,470
Alone?

740
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,760
I had company.

741
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,280
Where is he?

742
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,740
He went to the commune.

743
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,190
Are you getting used to being here?

744
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes.

745
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,840
You know, educated youth are here

746
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,000
to learn from the working people

747
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,960
and become friends
with the poor peasants.

748
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,030
Tell me. How many close friends

749
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,110
have you made here?

750
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,630
We're all revolutionary comrades.

751
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,870
Jiali,

752
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,280
you're a big girl now.

753
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,630
Mom, are you thirsty?

754
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,150
You're 18 now.

755
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,880
You can't be called a girl anymore.

756
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,360
You're a woman.

757
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,870
Do you know

758
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,630
what's most important

759
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,030
for a woman?

760
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,190
Reputation.

761
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,280
Once a woman's reputation is ruined,

762
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,070
it's ruined for life.

763
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,510
I don't want people to say

764
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,230
that our family
has no proper upbringing

765
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,190
and that your parents
didn't teach you well.

766
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,880
Mom, did you come all this way

767
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,640
just to say this to me?

768
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,490
Yes.

769
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,590
I'm your mom.

770
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,440
My responsibility is to warn you.

771
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,960
It's for your own good.

772
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,670
I know, Mom.

773
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,070
I'm not stupid.

774
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,190
This is a remote countryside,

775
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,760
and your parents aren't here
to keep an eye on you,

776
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,030
so it's easy to make mistakes.

777
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,710
One misstep could lead
to regret for a lifetime.

778
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,550
I understand.

779
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,230
You're in your teenage years,

780
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,840
experiencing your first crush,

781
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,480
and it's easy to act impulsively.

782
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,800
You're the eldest sister,

783
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,550
and you have several younger sisters.

784
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,190
You need to set an example.

785
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,840
Okay, I understand, Mom.

786
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,800
If it's fine with you,

787
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,680
I'll go to the fields,

788
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,000
or they'll deduct my work points.

789
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,230
I walked all the way here.

790
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,880
Is that how you treat me?

791
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,760
You misunderstood.

792
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,800
I just think you're tired.

793
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,880
I'll ask the captain to send you
in a tractor.

794
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,290
I'll have some villagers
bring you some things.

795
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,650
Mom,

796
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,670
there is plain boiled water,

797
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,880
eggs, and bread slices.

798
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,400
Eat it on the road.

799
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,230
And this hat.

800
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,510
You should wear it
to protect from the sun.

801
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,230
- What about you?
- I still have some.

802
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,360
Eat more. You've lost weight.

803
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Take care of yourself.

804
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Captain, go.

805
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,960
Go back. Don't worry.

806
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,510
Thank you.

807
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,440
I'm leaving now.

808
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,640
He Jiali,

809
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,070
happy birthday!

810
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,680
I just came to check on you.

811
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,440
Go back now.
