15
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,530
Your master was here just now.

16
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,730
Why did she come?

17
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,730
To propose to you.

18
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,090
Seriously?

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,730
Come on, tell Mom

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,810
how far you've got

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,220
with Hongyu.

22
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,780
We're not there yet.

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,220
Then why did she propose to you?

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,010
I told her not to come.

25
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,940
Did he take advantage of you?

26
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,900
Mom, what are you thinking?

27
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,500
Listen to me.

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,850
If you only want to date him,

29
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,620
not marry him,

30
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,780
don't cross the line.

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,530
We've learned a lesson.

32
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,410
Mom,

33
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,940
stop being conservative, ok?

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,810
He took advantage of me?

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,570
I may take advantage of him.

36
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,690
Don't you know?

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,500
Your mom is afraid that you'll suffer.

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,500
Mom, look.

39
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,340
They're such a worry.

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,500
In only a few years,

41
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,620
my daughters were taken away one by one.

42
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,940
Mom, Hongyu is good to me.

43
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,130
What does he do?

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,220
He gives me all his paycheck.

45
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,130
You're taking his paycheck?

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,620
Gifts can blind your eyes

47
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,940
and cloud your mind.

48
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,940
Doesn't she know that?

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,810
Grandma, why are you so angry?

50
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,530
Mom, don't be angry.

51
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,740
I'll talk to her.

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,650
Take a break in your room.

53
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,650
Did Hongyu

54
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,090
give you all his money?

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,740
I have all his money.

56
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,020
What do you mean?

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,370
It's like stocks.

58
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,570
Look, if he wants to be with me,

59
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,780
he has to invest money.

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,940
If we get married in the future,

61
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,090
what's mine is his.

62
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,940
He won't lose anything.

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,340
He'll have to invest more.

64
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,810
If we don't get married,

65
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,130
I won't return the money anyway.

66
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,780
I'll take it as compensation.

67
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,130
You're quite calculating.

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,740
I take after you.

69
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,410
You're good at doing business.

70
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,810
Ok, then.

71
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,300
In a few days, I'll ask Jiali...

72
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,900
Mom, Mom,

73
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,740
don't.

74
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,620
Everything becomes complicated

75
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,970
when she gets involved.

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,620
I'm getting married, not her.

77
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,500
Does it matter if she agrees or not?

78
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,570
If we really go that far,

79
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,500
can't I marry Hongyu if she doesn't agree?

80
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,220
But you don't know Wang Huaimin...

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,340
Mom,

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,130
in this family,

83
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,180
I don't trust anyone but you.

84
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,890
I'm closest to Mom.

85
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,130
I was raised by Mom herself.

86
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,420
If they want me,

87
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,980
they'll have to compensate you.

88
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,810
When they give you money again,

89
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,130
do keep it.

90
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,300
Don't be embarrassed.

91
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,890
It's just the beginning.

92
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,980
They'll have to pay the bride-price,

93
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,420
not a penny less.

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,600
(Jinman Restaurant)

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,860
(Fang Zhicheng's One-Month-Old Feast)

96
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,770
What a pretty boy.

97
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,980
He's got the best of our family.

98
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,570
Luckily, he looks more like Jiahuan.

99
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,130
He looks like you.

100
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,970
Where is Jiahuan?

101
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,740
Something came up at work.

102
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
She went to work.

103
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,570
Has she finished her maternity leave?

104
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,810
Not yet.

105
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,450
Let me hold you.

106
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,130
Let Grandma hold you.

107
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,210
Zhicheng.

108
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,050
Let me hold you.

109
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,180
A red envelope from Aunt.

110
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,210
Happy one month old.

111
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,540
Thanks, Jiali.

112
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,380
Don't mention it.

113
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,700
His eyes are so wide open.

114
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,690
Yes.

115
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,780
- Ouyang.
- Come on.

116
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,940
Have some candy.

117
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,500
And melon seeds.

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,340
Jiayi,

119
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,740
I'm grateful.

120
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,650
Really.

121
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,300
Thanks for sending Ms. Liao.

122
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,130
I'm too busy

123
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,330
to do it all by myself.

124
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,500
It was Jiayi's wise decision.

125
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,340
Yes.

126
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,010
Ms. Liao complained to me.

127
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,500
She said Jiahuan went missing

128
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,370
during her postnatal recovery.

129
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,330
She asked where she went.

130
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,500
She said she went to work.

131
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,420
We've been busy these days.

132
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,690
We'll thank you later.

133
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,690
It's ok.

134
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,980
Have some candy.

135
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,420
Fang Tao,

136
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,540
when is Jiahuan coming?

137
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,570
She has to work overtime.

138
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,770
She should be here soon.

139
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,500
(He Xiangdong)
Aunt, are you going to...

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,210
He Xiangdong, I...

141
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,810
I've got to fix you.

142
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,690
- Jiawen.
- Hi.

143
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,810
Jiawen, Weiguo.

144
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,100
- Guangming.
- I'll order first.

145
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,450
- Ok.
- Mom, let me hold him.

146
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,290
- Jiali.
- Hi.

147
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,580
How are you doing?

148
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,500
Good boy. Have some more later.

149
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,340
Where is Jianguo?

150
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,860
He took the militia to training.

151
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,300
- Take a seat.
- I'll say hi to Mom first.

152
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,010
- Ok. Go ahead.
- You've grown again.

153
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,500
- Mom.
- Jiawen.

154
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,620
Go play with them.

155
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,890
- Go ahead.
- Mom.

156
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,850
Guangming.

157
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,810
You've both lost weight.

158
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,620
No, only Jiawen lost weight.

159
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,420
No, not at all.

160
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,660
As long as you're healthy,

161
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,910
(Banquet)
it's ok to lose a little weight.

162
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,210
You've recovered well.

163
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,810
- Are you hungry?
- A little.

164
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,180
I'm hungry.

165
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,570
Shall we eat?

166
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,010
Come on, sit down.

167
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,500
I'll call Jiahuan.

168
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,890
Jiahuan's number.

169
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,890
You talk to her.

170
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,210
Talk to Jiahuan.

171
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,540
Hello, Jiahuan.

172
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,450
Everyone is here except you.

173
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,330
When are you coming?

174
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,460
Ok.

175
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,060
She still has a meeting.

176
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,010
Let's get started.

177
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,100
Ok, take your seats, guys.

178
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,500
- Come on.
- Take your seats.

179
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,180
Come on, Xiaoling.

180
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,130
- Let's eat.
- Sit wherever you want.

181
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,540
Come on.

182
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,940
Jiaxi.

183
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,100
Where to sit?

184
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,940
Let Fang Tao sit here.

185
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
Ok.

186
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,010
Don't leave after dinner.

187
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,370
I have a few words with you.

188
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,620
(Cash Desk)
Thanks for the imported medicine.

189
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,810
Don't mention it. We're family.

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,530
Guangming,

191
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,010
stay with us when you're on vacation.

192
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,660
Help your cousin with his lessons.

193
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,060
He can't keep up with his studies.

194
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,100
He's just a kid. He'll do better.

195
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,180
Wait until he gets the hang of it.

196
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,500
Gets the hang of it?

197
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,740
Is there such a thing?

198
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,250
Have you forgotten?

199
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,420
You couldn't do math when you were little.

200
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,130
But you knew it right away in third grade.

201
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,060
Jiawen!

202
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,890
I heard your factory is also closing down.

203
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,130
Why don't you work with Ouyang?

204
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,860
I don't know much about business.

205
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,890
You can learn by doing.

206
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,250
Jiahuan,

207
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,420
you're finally here.

208
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,890
Who are we celebrating for?

209
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,300
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,860
My boss suddenly came.

211
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,890
I had no choice.

212
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,060
Ouyang has been working all day.

213
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,980
His feelings

214
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,370
are completely disregarded.

215
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,210
It's on me next time.

216
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,250
I'm sorry, sorry.

217
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,740
Boss, we all understand.

218
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,330
Have you boxed the leftovers?

219
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,300
Jiali and Jiaxi are still there.

220
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,610
Don't take it home.

221
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,020
Just eat it here.

222
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,690
Yeah, with the baby,

223
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm afraid I won't have time at home.

224
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,090
Mom, let's go home.

225
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,780
- We're leaving first.
- Ok.

226
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,970
- We're off.
- You go ahead.

227
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,100
- We're off now.
- Bye, Weiguo.

228
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,330
- Come on, son.
- Guangming, remember.

229
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,540
Let's see Auntie and Uncle off.

230
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,570
He just fell asleep.

231
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,450
Let me hold him.

232
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,420
You're lucky to have Fang Tao.

233
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,940
No man but him

234
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,780
could stand you, you know?

235
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,900
You're too busy to go home.

236
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,260
He couldn't even see you.

237
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,210
What does he want from you?

238
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,330
Don't they say

239
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,690
every successful woman

240
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,300
has a man behind her?

241
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,810
Yes, I strongly support the boss.

242
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,490
Alright, boss.

243
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,690
Get in for dinner.

244
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,620
I'm leaving.

245
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,810
I've paid the bill.

246
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,810
- Thank you.
- Take care, Jiayi.

247
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,100
Take care.

248
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,690
I know what you're going to say.

249
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,450
Hongyu and I aren't right for each other.

250
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,290
You disagree, right?

251
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,810
Did I say that?

252
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,020
Why would I disagree?

253
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,610
No matter Jiayi, Jiahuan, or Xiaoling,

254
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,450
you never gave your wholehearted approval.

255
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,850
I disapprove?

256
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,900
Then how did they get married?

257
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,420
Because you couldn't stop them.

258
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,940
You've been dating Yan Hongyu for a while.

259
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,540
I've never wanted to stop you.

260
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,660
Really?

261
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,180
Then why did you set me up with others?

262
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,210
Because Mom

263
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,730
asked me and Jianguo to do it.

264
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,060
It was for your own good.

265
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,490
Before it's settled,

266
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,730
you should meet a few more guys

267
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,260
so you'll know who is more suitable for you.

268
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,660
I'm sure Yan Hongyu is the one.

269
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,500
He is good to me.

270
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,300
Yan Hongyu is one thing.

271
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,900
His mom is another.

272
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,690
Jiali, that's weird.

273
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,330
If you don't like my master so much,

274
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,300
you shouldn't have led me to her

275
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,540
and asked her to teach me.

276
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,420
Could you stay at the Soy Sauce Factory?

277
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,570
Could you work as hard as Mom?

278
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,090
Who cried and tried to get out?

279
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,690
Did you ask Wang Huaimin to propose?

280
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,940
I didn't.

281
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,850
With them, we must follow the procedures.

282
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,210
Not a single step can be skipped.

283
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,490
This is not the way to get you engaged.

284
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,540
The two families must sit down

285
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,850
and get everything straight

286
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,330
before you get engaged.

287
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,990
Jiali,

288
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,900
I don't get it.

289
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,600
Mom has agreed.

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,850
Why are you making things difficult?

291
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,900
Mom agreed?

292
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,210
The family council has three members.

293
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,660
Minorities follow majorities.

294
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,490
One member's consent isn't enough.

295
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,940
How did Mom agree?

296
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,210
Dad entrusted you to me.

297
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,540
I'm responsible for each one of you.

298
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,260
No mistakes in starting a family.

299
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,610
Haven't you made enough mistakes?

300
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,260
Jiali, have you realized

301
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,260
that you're a little twisted?

302
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,210
Just because you didn't

303
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,450
get together with Tang Weimin,

304
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,690
you feel bad to see

305
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,540
people in love.

306
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,530
You are sick!

307
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,100
You...

308
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,970
Still upset?

309
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,090
Should I be upset

310
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,260
or not?

311
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,500
You should.

312
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,940
But try to understand me, too.

313
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,420
When I was going to leave,

314
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,660
the big boss returned.

315
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,660
What should I do?

316
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,450
You're on maternity leave.

317
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,730
I've heard of people dodging bullets,

318
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,660
not volunteering

319
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
to be a target.

320
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,940
Can't your company function without you?

321
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,300
You don't have to

322
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,690
wait upon your boss like this.

323
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,020
I can't explain it to you.

324
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,330
It's your son's first month.

325
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,140
Jiayi paid for the celebration.

326
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,540
The whole family was waiting for you,

327
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,450
but you didn't come.

328
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,090
Did you show them any respect?

329
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,260
I apologized to them.

330
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,660
I was sincere.

331
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,690
What about your son?

332
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,200
He is one month old now.

333
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,540
(One-Month-Old Feast)
His mom didn't come.

334
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,850
Shouldn't you apologize to him?

335
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,900
I'm sorry.

336
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,260
Baby, it's Mom's fault, ok?

337
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,540
You only focus on your own plate.

338
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,260
Your son is starving.

339
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,060
- Come on.
- Look how thin

340
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,260
his face is.

341
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,060
- Come here.
- Be careful.

342
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,330
For today's celebration,

343
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,570
Jiayi and Ouyang must have done a lot.

344
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,780
It cost them a lot.

345
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,060
Later,

346
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,060
we should treat them

347
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,660
to show our appreciation.

348
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,060
I'm talking to you.

349
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,900
Get lost!

350
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,140
Aunt, why are you so cranky?

351
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,730
What's wrong with you?

352
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,570
What's wrong?

353
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,180
Why are you crying?

354
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,380
Sit down. Sit.

355
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,260
- What's wrong, Jiaxi?
- Mom.

356
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,140
Jiali slapped me.

357
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,610
Why would she do that?

358
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,540
She didn't want me to be with Hongyu.

359
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,260
I said no, and she slapped me.

360
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,450
Jiali wouldn't do that for no reason.

361
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,650
Grandma!

362
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,210
You're still defending her!

363
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,450
Look how swollen my face is!

364
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,060
You were overweight to begin with.

365
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,330
Mom, look at Grandma!

366
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,900
- No. No.
- I slapped her.

367
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,980
Jiaxi,

368
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,450
tell Mom and Grandma whether I disagreed

369
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,260
with you dating Hongyu.

370
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,300
And what did you say?

371
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,140
Tell them.

372
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,660
What did you say?

373
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,450
Jiaxi. Jiaxi!

374
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,940
Why did you slap her?

375
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,850
You could have talked to her.

376
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,450
Why did you do that?

377
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,900
Jiaxi, open the door.

378
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,810
Let me take a look.

379
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,930
Jiali,

380
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,810
what happened, exactly?

381
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,690
Why did you slap her?

382
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,650
Jiaxi.

383
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,660
It's not right to slap her.

384
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,740
Jiaxi,

385
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,140
it's my fault for slapping you.

386
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,490
I apologize.

387
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,850
As for you dating Hongyu,

388
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,490
Mom, Grandma, and I never opposed it.

389
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,330
We're afraid

390
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,330
you'll get yourself into trouble.

391
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,450
If you're sure he is the right one,

392
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,450
let's follow the proper procedure.

393
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,730
The two families should talk it over

394
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,020
rather than making decisions

395
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,330
behind closed doors.

396
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,540
It's disrespectful to you.

397
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,540
You're not married yet.

398
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,090
You still have the initiative.

399
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,140
It'll be hard to make any demands

400
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,660
when you get married.

401
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,330
Did you hear that, Jiaxi?

402
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,060
Jiali is right.

403
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,850
I'll go to see Wang Huaimin

404
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,730
and invite her and Hongyu over.

405
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,900
Marriage is like diplomacy.

406
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Don't make it like smuggling.

407
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,140
You don't have to invite them!

408
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,610
I'll do it myself.

409
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,020
Then do it yourself.

410
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,450
I can't believe you.

411
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,060
How could you slap her?

412
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,490
And in the face?

413
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,450
Can you solve the problem by hitting her?

414
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,450
Mom, it's not what you think.

415
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,660
He jiali, shame on you!

416
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,450
It's not right to hit her.

417
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,610
Grandma,

418
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,210
I've dedicated myself to this family

419
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,730
without any personal agenda.

420
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,650
Why?

421
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,260
Feel aggrieved?

422
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,530
As the eldest,

423
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,210
enduring grievances is part of your duty.

424
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,690
This family still rests on your shoulders.

425
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,450
We're reasonable people.

426
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,490
Sure, we must be reasonable.

427
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,690
Hongyu and Jiaxi

428
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,010
are good kids with kind hearts.

429
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,450
They fell in love at first sight,

430
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,620
grew attached over time,

431
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,830
and are well-suited for each other.

432
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,380
Now it's time for them

433
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,490
to take a step forward

434
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,940
towards a happy marriage, right?

435
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,180
So, shall we talk about the specifics

436
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,250
of their marriage?

437
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,500
Ok.

438
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,250
The betrothal gifts are simple,

439
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,860
like all the other families in town.

440
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,050
My mom raised so many daughters.

441
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,530
None of them were sold.

442
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,010
She wanted us to marry into good families

443
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,660
and live a good life.

444
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,450
We won't keep a penny

445
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,290
of the bride-price or gifts.

446
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,250
We'll give them all to the new couple,

447
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,820
as a support for their new life.

448
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,250
You're reasonable.

449
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,420
I knew you were not worldly-minded.

450
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,340
I assure you today.

451
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,140
Jiaxi can take the household reins

452
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,860
and be in charge of her little family.

453
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,140
I won't interfere with their business.

454
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,860
I'm Jiaxi's master.

455
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,770
As the old saying goes,

456
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,290
"Once a master

457
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,250
always a father."

458
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,900
I'm half her mom.

459
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,940
Once she marries into my family,

460
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,450
the other half will be ready.

461
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,900
Though I'm not her real mom,

462
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,620
don't worry.

463
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,690
I'll treat her like my own daughter

464
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,140
and won't let her suffer.

465
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,420
What's your mom asking for?

466
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,690
What's taking her so long?

467
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,940
My mom asks for nothing

468
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,690
but one thing,

469
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,660
to get us married as soon as possible.

470
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,660
It depends on your mom and sister.

471
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm afraid they'll ask for too much

472
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,290
and demand an exorbitant price.

473
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
What do you mean?

474
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,860
What is an exorbitant price?

475
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,730
They won't do it.

476
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,570
Even if they do,

477
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,940
it's only right that a nice girl like me

478
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,580
should get married with strings attached.

479
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,420
Yes.

480
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,490
But it isn't a trade.

481
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,530
It's you

482
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,730
marrying into my family.

483
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,050
Forget it, stingy guy.

484
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,050
I didn't say we wouldn't do it.

485
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,820
We'll do whatever we can.

486
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,620
If we can't, I'll try my best

487
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,660
to make it happen.

488
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,180
My heart beats true to you.

489
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,290
We're not married yet,

490
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,380
but I give you my paycheck every month.

491
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,850
That's true.

492
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,380
The second floor will be their wedding room.

493
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,140
It's separated from the neighboring rooms.

494
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,340
They have separate stairs.

495
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,100
They'll live alone,

496
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,050
undisturbed.

497
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,660
Still, she has to live with you?

498
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,330
Wang,

499
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,420
when your eldest son got married,

500
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,210
you gave him a house.

501
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,530
Yes.

502
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,420
But that's not a problem.

503
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,690
Hongyu's company is allocating housing.

504
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,010
He's on the waiting list.

505
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,730
We are not being difficult,

506
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,210
but if they're really getting married,

507
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,490
they need a decent house.

508
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,660
When my fifth sister got married,

509
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
her sister-in-law gave them one.

510
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,730
You're the mom.

511
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,450
You can solve the problem, right?

512
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,660
Besides, familiarity breeds contempt.

513
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,490
You're both at peace if you live apart.

514
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,180
Ok.

515
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,610
Ok.

516
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,740
Ok.

517
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,250
Here comes the Fried Sugar Cake.

518
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,150
Put them here.

519
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,140
Sir, is the meat leftover?

520
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,450
Why does it taste funny?

521
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,860
No way.

522
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,660
It's made from fresh pork shoulder.

523
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,530
Unbelievable.

524
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,580
The Fried Sugar Cake isn't right, either.

525
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,820
No way. They are freshly fried.

526
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,530
You're unbelievable.

527
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,580
Throw up farther.

528
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,770
I've got business to do.

529
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,970
I'll clean it up for you.

530
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,130
Are you ok?

531
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,810
What's wrong?

532
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,580
You did it on purpose

533
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,010
I didn't, really.

534
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,180
(Pregnancy Test, Positive)
It was an accident.

535
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,340
Isn't it a good thing

536
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
we're having a baby?

537
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,250
What about our house?

538
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,620
It isn't ready yet.

539
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm not marrying you anyway.

540
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,820
I don't want the baby either.

541
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,180
I'm sure we'll get a house.

542
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,690
Don't do anything stupid.

543
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,090
Yan Hongyu,

544
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,180
don't tell anyone about this,

545
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,620
especially your mom.

546
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,250
How can we hide this?

547
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,820
If a third person finds out about this,

548
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,180
we're done.

549
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,180
You've held it in during the meal.

550
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,690
What is it? Tell me.

551
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,450
Something happened to Hongyu's family.

552
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,700
What happened?

553
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,970
His dad just had surgery.

554
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,820
What surgery?

555
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,660
Is it serious?

556
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,490
I didn't quite catch it.

557
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,100
There seemed to be

558
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,730
a blood clot in his heart.

559
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,210
So he needed surgery to remove it.

560
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,970
He must have suffered.

561
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,770
His recovery is a big problem.

562
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,210
He needs ganoderma lucidum and ginseng.

563
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,290
It's costly.

564
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,770
Hongyu's mom is so determined

565
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,900
that she didn't even tell us.

566
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,450
She's been busy

567
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,420
getting us a house.

568
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,900
I heard about it indirectly.

569
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,820
It pains me to see that.

570
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,580
His dad is suffering

571
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,380
and we're forcing them to get us a house.

572
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,450
Seriously?

573
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,180
It makes us look like a family disgrace.

574
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,820
Mom, I'm not just saying it.

575
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,620
If you got sick in the future,

576
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,820
I would sacrifice my life for you,

577
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,770
not to mention a house.

578
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,900
Don't jinx it!

579
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,380
What are you talking about?

580
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,450
But you're really a good daughter.

581
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,380
That's because you raised me well.

582
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,010
Didn't you always tell me to be kind?

583
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,620
What do you want to say?

584
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,010
It's no big deal.

585
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,050
I'm thinking

586
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,210
that the suite on the second floor

587
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,210
of Hongyu's house is ready.

588
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,660
Why don't we get married first?

589
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,100
When their financial situation improves,

590
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,900
we'll talk about the house.

591
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,210
Did Wang Huaimin give you the idea?

592
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,900
No, no.

593
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,290
She has no idea at all.

594
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,860
That's my own plan.

595
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,010
That's why I say

596
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,970
my daughter

597
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,050
is kind-hearted.

598
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,050
But you're being silly.

599
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,010
If you can't get a house now,

600
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,210
you can't get one

601
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,420
after you get married.

602
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,260
Mom,

603
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,750
they'll be my family sooner or later.

604
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,770
Why do I have to be so calculating?

605
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,700
It's tiring.

606
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,420
It's getting late.

607
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,970
Why isn't Jiaxi back yet?

608
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,290
She went on a date.

609
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,820
Is she always this late?

610
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,420
Once in a while.

611
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,210
Jiaxi said

612
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,820
Hongyu's dad just had surgery.

613
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,010
They're in a difficult situation.

614
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,050
Let's forget about the house for now.

615
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,620
Did you agree?

616
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,380
If you don't agree, how dare I?

617
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,010
Is it Jiaxi's idea,

618
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,690
or did Wang Huaimin ask her to say it?

619
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,250
To be frank with you,

620
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,420
it's her own idea this time.

621
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,620
I think she's determined

622
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,420
to marry Hongyu.

623
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,180
In that case,

624
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,420
let's forget about it.

625
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,820
You have no principles when it comes to her.

626
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,820
They have a place to live,

627
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,660
don't they?

628
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,210
I'm worried that she'll have trouble

629
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,860
living with Wang Huaimin.

630
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,690
That woman is mean.

631
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,210
Sooner or later,

632
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,450
she has to get used to it.

633
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,210
I think you already agreed.

634
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,380
You're just informing me.

635
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,480
(Blessings)
Jiaxi,

636
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,860
we used to own all the rooms

637
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,900
upstairs and downstairs.

638
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,890
The second floor

639
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,010
will be your wedding room.

640
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,010
We'll redecorate it.

641
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,620
Just tell me what you like.

642
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,250
We'll do everything the way you like it.

643
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,970
We'll replace all the furniture.

644
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,020
Thanks, Master.

645
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,660
Master, still?

646
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,450
Mom, have you got any gifts?

647
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,610
Sure.

648
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,530
Put this on.

649
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,620
Thanks, Mom.

650
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,970
Great.

651
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,940
Jia...

652
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,010
What's wrong with her?

653
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,580
She's been to the bathroom three times.

654
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,860
Did she eat something bad?

655
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,210
No, don't worry about her.

656
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,900
Go downstairs and bring her the berberine

657
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,250
from my bedside table.

658
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,460
No need.

659
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,420
Go, hurry up.

660
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
Hongyu.

661
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,820
Mom.

662
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,050
Let me sleep, ok?

663
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,690
Is Jiaxi

664
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,580
pregnant?

665
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,420
No.

666
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,850
No?

667
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,490
You don't look right.

668
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,140
Silly boy.

669
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,620
Just admit it.

670
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,210
Isn't it a blessing?

671
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,210
Why are you lying? Tell me the truth.

672
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,280
Hongyu, tell me the truth.

673
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,690
Tell me the truth!

674
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,100
Cold, Mom! I'm a grown-up!

675
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,420
Why are you still doing this?

676
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,580
Tell me the truth.

677
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,420
When we get married,

678
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,900
you'll have a grandson.

679
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Are you saying

680
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,770
she is really pregnant?

681
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,940
That's great!

682
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,210
She's pregnant!

683
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,900
If she's pregnant,

684
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,010
I'll change the way I play.

685
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,290
I will

686
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,290
get the house ready

687
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,900
and take care of the decoration.

688
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,150
Brand new furniture.

689
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,900
All to the highest standard.

690
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,130
As for the domestic appliances,

691
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,590
Hongyu's brother and sister will handle it.

692
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,370
Their younger brother is getting married.

693
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,170
They must do something for him.

694
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,010
As for the other expenses,

695
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,420
I'm here

696
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,250
to discuss it with you.

697
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,180
There are no more expenses.

698
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,620
We've agreed on the bride-price.

699
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,450
And the wedding banquet.

700
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,580
How many tables are you going to book?

701
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,770
We'll each pay half.

702
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,450
15, ok?

703
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,500
Ok.

704
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,840
What about the dowry?

705
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
What are you going to offer?

706
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,970
We were going to pay for the appliances.

707
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,100
But you got ahead of us.

708
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,490
We'll see what the kids need.

709
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,210
How about a car?

710
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
A van

711
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,860
or a car, whatever.

712
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
You didn't say it before.

713
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm not going to drive the car.

714
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,420
It's for the kids.

715
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,660
It sounds

716
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,380
expensive,

717
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,450
but you are a big family.

718
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,860
Jiaxi has five sisters,

719
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,050
right? And her mom, grandma.

720
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,900
You can

721
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,450
chip in for the dowry,

722
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,290
right?

723
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,530
About this, we'll...

724
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,370
Ok, then.

725
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,290
I'll go home and wait for your reply.

726
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,240
Don't walk me out.

727
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,860
What did she mean?

728
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,100
She asked for a car?

729
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,820
That's highway robbery.

730
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,620
I want a car too.

731
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,620
Wang Huaimin is unbelievable.

732
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,860
She's making

733
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,450
your grandma sick.

734
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,770
Girls, what's

735
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,820
your opinion?

736
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,420
We can club together,

737
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,690
but she's doing this at the last minute.

738
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,580
What's the reason?

739
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,970
What's wrong with her?

740
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,580
Does she want it, or do you?

741
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,900
I don't know anything about it.

742
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,010
We've taken a step back

743
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,330
on the house.

744
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,380
Why is she pushing her luck?

745
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,690
Jiaxi, you're on our side.

746
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,580
You should tell us

747
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,820
everything you know.

748
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,050
There's no need for a plan.

749
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,420
I'll talk to Yan Hongyu.

750
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,260
I'm not getting married.

751
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,660
Don't be rash.

752
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,210
We're on the final step.

753
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,420
How can you not get married?

754
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,820
You don't get married for Wang Huaimin.

755
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,490
Why is she so unreasonable?

756
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,100
I've warned you before.

757
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:33,890
What's wrong?

758
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,010
What's wrong, Jiaxi?

759
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,740
Jiaxi,

760
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,210
what's wrong?

761
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,100
You must tell us the truth.

762
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,850
I...

763
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,420
I am...

764
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,130
I'm just...

765
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,850
Jiali,

766
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,620
go ahead and scold me.

767
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,180
I won't talk back.

768
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,010
Why would I scold you?

769
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,490
What's the point?

770
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,050
I did something wrong.

771
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,770
Hongyu is a nice guy

772
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,860
and treats you well.

773
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,490
But he did it wrong in this case.

774
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,530
Jiaxi,

775
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,660
you're a girl.

776
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,450
You should have a girl's dignity.

777
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,900
You have to know

778
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,900
what to do

779
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,620
and when to do it.

780
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,180
If this gets out,

781
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,770
people will say you're ill-bred.

782
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,210
There, there. Don't cry.

783
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,580
There, don't cry.

784
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,850
Don't cry.

785
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,810
Tomorrow.

786
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,050
Tomorrow, I'll talk to Wang Huaimin.

787
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,210
When you are married,

788
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,690
keep your eyes open.

789
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,620
You have a big family to fall back on.

790
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,860
Don't hide it from us when you're in trouble.

791
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,700
Thank you, Jiali.

792
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,140
Jiali,

793
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,800
what do you think of the wedding room?

794
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,720
The furniture is all new,

795
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,780
made of the finest wood.

796
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,650
It will last a lifetime.

797
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,570
It shows our sincerity.

798
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,700
Yes, full of sincerity.

799
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,540
We've shown our sincerity.

800
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,820
You should show yours too.

801
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,820
But there's a new development.

802
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,450
What is it?

803
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,970
It concerns Jiaxi.

804
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,780
What happened to her?

805
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,610
She is pregnant

806
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,260
and the father is Hongyu.

807
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,490
Didn't you know that?

808
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,160
I didn't know.

809
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,130
I really didn't.

810
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,650
Now you know.

811
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,420
You'll get a bride with a baby.

812
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,300
Isn't that a great dowry?

813
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,540
Jiali,

814
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,010
are you going back on your word?

815
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,380
I'm not.

816
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,450
I just want to

817
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,820
settle the score with you.

818
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,130
You said you'd treat her like your daughter.

819
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,220
Now she's pregnant

820
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,260
before getting married.

821
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,260
Don't you think she'll be ashamed?

822
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,220
Won't her family be ashamed?

823
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,780
Is that how you treat her?

824
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,900
Well, look,

825
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,570
young people

826
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,010
couldn't help themselves.

827
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,780
What can I do about it?

828
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,130
You know,

829
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,220
we kept our promise.

830
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,780
You should also keep your word, right?

831
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,650
- We can keep our word.
- Good.

832
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,820
But let's talk

833
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,380
about compensation first.

834
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,900
Compensation for what?

835
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,570
Hongyu broke the rules.

836
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,220
You should compensate us.

837
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
He Jiali,

838
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,780
if you're unreasonable,

839
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,220
I'm not going to be reasonable.

840
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,060
I'm telling you.

841
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,490
Anyway, your sister's belly

842
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,820
is getting bigger and bigger.

843
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,780
If my son doesn't marry her,

844
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,290
she...

845
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,450
That's fine.

846
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,490
She doesn't have to marry him.

847
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,650
Big deal, we'll raise the baby.

848
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,010
The He family can afford it.

849
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,090
But I can't guarantee

850
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,970
that the child will think of you

851
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,380
as his grandma.

852
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,260
Jiali, it's not that bad.

853
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,220
We don't have to go that far.

854
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,170
Not that bad.

855
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,090
Come on, sit.

856
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,010
Wang, you are a sensible woman.

857
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,820
Why would you do something so stupid?

858
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,820
Tell me what you want

859
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,900
and we can discuss it.

860
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,780
If you're going to blackmail me,

861
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,010
I've never given in to anyone

862
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,780
in my life.

863
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,290
Well,

864
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,220
do you think this will work?

865
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,610
Let's put the car

866
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,090
on hold.

867
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,050
They can buy their own car

868
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,450
when they make money.

869
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,290
Let's leave it to them.

870
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,860
Our priority now

871
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,090
is to get them married,

872
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,900
otherwise Jiaxi's belly is getting big

873
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,380
and it won't look good, right?

874
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,450
Ok, let's do what you say.

875
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,700
You look like a beautiful fairy.

876
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,370
Hongyu,

877
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,290
take a look.

878
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,220
What do you think?

879
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,140
Beautiful.

880
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,340
Ok, this is it.

881
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,540
I'll buy this one.

882
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,930
Jiaxi,

883
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,340
you'll only wear the wedding dress once.

884
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,570
It takes up space

885
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,450
if you keep it at home.

886
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,940
We can rent it.

887
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,490
What do you mean?

888
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,090
It's my first time getting married.

889
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,300
Why can't I buy a wedding dress?

890
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,100
Besides,

891
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,780
I even brought you a gift.

892
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,300
Why can't you buy me a wedding dress?

893
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,370
Ok.

894
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,740
I'll talk to my mom.

895
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,580
I'm not marrying you.

896
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,490
Ok, ok.

897
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,180
Buy it.

898
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,740
Mom.

899
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,700
Don't cry.

900
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,540
Don't.

901
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,970
You make me want to cry.

902
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,740
Enough, Jiaxi, stop crying.

903
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,740
Look, if you keep crying,

904
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,010
your eye makeup will be smeared.

905
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I'll stop.

906
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,700
Mom, stop crying.

907
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,090
It doesn't look good.

908
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,130
Mom, that's enough.

909
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,130
The groom will be here soon.

910
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,420
Jiaxi, change your shoes.

911
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,860
- Change shoes.
- They'll be here soon.

912
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,220
Mom, it's a big day.

913
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,740
Don't be sad.

914
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,170
You've been picked like peaches

915
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,970
one by one.

916
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,700
Mom, you didn't cry so much at my wedding.

917
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,780
Been picked and back in your basket again.

918
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,660
Seriously?

919
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,700
You've married your daughters off before.

920
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,900
Take it easy. Take it easy.

921
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,740
I know.

922
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,100
I'm ok now.

923
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,930
They are coming.

924
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,220
Get in.

925
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,970
They're here.

926
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,340
- Ok.
- Hurry up.

927
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,180
Dress. Dress.

928
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,450
How's the veil?

929
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,490
It's ok.

930
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,740
Jiayi, help me fix the dress.

931
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,930
Ok.

932
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,810
Ok.

933
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,580
Hongyu,

934
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,740
I'm telling you.

935
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,130
Jiaxi has us to fall back on.

936
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Don't you dare bully her.

937
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,860
Enough, Jiahuan.

938
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,090
Don't scare him.

939
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,340
They are husband and wife now.

940
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,650
Another one got into the trap.

941
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,900
Be good to my sister.

942
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,660
Hold her.

943
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,490
Hongyu.

944
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,780
- Don't carry her.
- No.

945
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:18,970
Belly.

946
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,010
- Hold her.
- Hold.

947
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,540
Ok, hold her.

948
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,620
Be careful.

949
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,220
Be careful. Slowly.

950
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,220
Slowly.

951
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,370
Great!

952
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,700
The bride is coming out.

953
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,740
Come on. Follow up.

954
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,970
Hurry.

955
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,540
So pretty.

956
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,330
Meixin.

957
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,570
Look, she's lost one of her shoes.

958
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,970
- How did she lose a shoe?
- Hurry.

959
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,410
Shoe.

960
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,980
Shoe.

961
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,050
Put on the shoe!

962
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,010
Shoe.

963
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,090
Don't cry, Mom.

964
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,370
Don't cry.

965
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,300
Good.

966
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,170
Meixin, stop crying.

967
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,650
You've married the youngest off.

968
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:36,130
What a great success.

969
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:18,930

970
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,170

972
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,610
(have all started their own families.)

973
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,260
Remember to bring me candies.
