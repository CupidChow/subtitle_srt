Are you ok?

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
I'm fine.

18
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,710
Why aren't you at the show?

19
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,040
Go back to the show.

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,760
My mom is here.

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,980
(One month later)

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,550
Huaibin Theater.

Take Tiger Mountain by Strategy.

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Happy?

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
Not bad.

26
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,760
Take Qiufang to the theater.

27
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,230
Last time, your show of Pioneer Siblings

28
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,320
was delayed.

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,280
Mom, there you go again.

30
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,880
Are you going or not?

31
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,630
I am going.

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,160

34
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,470
Excuse me.

Jiali. Jiali.

36
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,670
Jiali. Jiali.

37
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,350
Stop.

38
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,670
Take Tiger Mountain by Strategy. Tomorrow.

39
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,910
I can't make it.

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,670
The tickets are hard to get.

41
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,880
I got them for you.

42
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
I have tickets.

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
How did you get them?

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,320
I have to take the girls with me.

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,480
I promised them.

46
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,280
Then take them with us.

47
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,670
Why don't you understand?

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,110
We can't be that close.

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,630
- Then, I...
- Get out of my way.

50
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,790
Jiali.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,070
Where are you going?

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,440
No where.

53
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,710
Wanna see a movie?

54
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
What movie?

55
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,720
Take Tiger Mountain by Strategy. Tomorrow.

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,260
(Huaibin Theater)

57
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,280
Gotta go. See you then.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
See you then.

59
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,670
He didn't even fold his quilt.

60
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,720
Are you here to see me?

61
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
What's up?

62
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Take it back.

63
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,280
What's this?

64
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,080
Your daughter is seducing my son.

65
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,110
I came to tell you

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,080
out of kindness.

67
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,350
A girl should guard her dignity

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,670
and not be so shameless, ok?

69
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,790
I'll ask her when I get back.

70
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,220
(Ticket Box)

71
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,680
Ticket.

72
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,630
Ok.

73
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,070
Let's get in.

74
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,710
Ticket.

75
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Where is Jiali?

76
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,670
She took Jiayi and Jiahuan to the theater.

77
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,520
Jiawen, follow your dad. Hurry.

78
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,920
The emperor dominates his subjects.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
The pagoda suppresses the monster.

80
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,190
Talking at midday, we have no faction.

81
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,790
Why are you blushing?

82
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,790
I'm in high spirits.

83
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,520
Why did your face turn yellow?

84
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,670
It's the wax against cold.

85
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,190
You work for Brigade Commander Xu?

86
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,190
Commander Xu's aide-de-camp, Hu Biao.

87
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,750
Hu Biao?

88
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,520
Let me ask you.

89
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,670
When did you start working for him?

90
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,110
When I was the police commissioner.

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,400
I heard that Commander Xu

92
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,520
has a few favorites.

93
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,110
Do you know where I got this?

94
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,630
Dad,

95
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,800
it's

96
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,520
not what you think.

97
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,430
Then what is it?

98
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
I...

99
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,630
It...

100
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,990
Did you make a date with him?

101
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,570
Sir, you've got it wrong.

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,670
I came with Qiufang.

103
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,280
Did you see that?

104
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,360
He's dating someone else.

105
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,360
Dad, let's go back.

106
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Come here.

107
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,160
Come here. Let me ask you.

108
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,880
Do you like her?

109
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,710
Then why are you dating another girl?

110
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,400
It's two-timing.

111
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,160
Let's go.

112
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,590
How can you have

113
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,160
such a man with no backbone?

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Dad!

115
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,790
Dad.

116
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,920
Do you hate Tang Weimin that much?

117
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,910
Jiali.

118
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,310
Apples and oranges.

119
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,920
Tang Weimin is a good guy.

120
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,550
Apples and oranges, seriously?

121
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,670
His last name is Tang.

122
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,310
It just doesn't work.

123
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,920
We don't care who you're with,

124
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,310
except for Tang's son.

125
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,590
I've never been with him.

127
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,790
This is feudalism.

128
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Feudalism?

129
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,920
Ask your mom.

130
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,120
See if she agrees.

131
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,120
Ask your sisters.

132
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
(Liu Xiaoling, He's fifth daughter)
Feudalism?

133
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,280
Let's have democracy, ok?

134
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,520
Listen up, girls.

135
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,310
Your big sister

136
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,120
wants to date that Tang boy.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,310
Do you agree?

138
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,550
Raise your hands if you don't agree.

139
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Can I abstain?

140
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
No.

141
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,590
Minorities follow majorities.

142
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,950
Write a pledge.

143
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
I won't.

144
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,430
Write!

145
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,670
Come on.

146
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,760
Go inside.

147
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,160
Jiawen, take your sisters inside.

148
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,670
Sit in the bed.

149
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,720
Jiali,

150
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,760
we don't want to force you.

151
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,710
You know our families

152
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,590
have unresolved feuds.

153
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,550
They've been giving your dad

154
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,070
and you a hard time.

155
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,310
To put it bluntly,

156
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,790
if it weren't for them,

157
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,120
your dad wouldn't have wanted a son.

158
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
Besides,

159
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,670
even if you get together with him,

160
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
then what?

161
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Marry him?

162
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,400
What's the point of marrying him?

163
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,070
Do you really think you can get along

164
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,550
with Big Tang and his wife?

165
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,920
If you have any problem,

166
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,310
do you think that guy

167
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,880
would stand up for you?

168
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,590
I can tell you, no.

169
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,160
Because his last name is Tang.

170
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,310
He wouldn't listen to you.

171
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,920
He listens to his parents.

172
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,430
You may end up

173
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,790
getting a divorce.

174
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,630
Jiali,

175
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,360
I had you after ten-month pregnancy.

176
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,710
Think about it.

177
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,070
How could I not plan for you?

178
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,760
If you

179
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,280
insist on going out with him,

180
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,120
word may get back

181
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,120
to your grandma back home

182
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,000
and make her die of anger.

183
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,920
You'll be a great sinner to our family.

184
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,120
Changsheng, say something.

185
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,160
What can I say?

186
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
She's grown up.

187
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,550
She has her own ideas.

188
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,710
Your mom and I

189
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,280
always thought you were

190
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,190
the sweetest of the six girls.

191
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,760
You always think of our family.

192
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,550
We have always been proud

193
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,550
of you.

194
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,520
Our eldest daughter is so good.

195
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,120
She's much better than a son.

196
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,190
Didn't you say it yourself?

197
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,590
We didn't have a boy.

198
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,640
You said, "It's ok, Dad.

199
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,520
I'm sure I'll be better than a boy."

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,520
I didn't expect you

201
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,670
to be drawn over to their side.

202
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,760
You're the eldest.

203
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,120
How can you set such an example

204
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,310
for your sisters?

205
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,920
Jiali, when I think of you

206
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,590
marrying into the Tang family,

207
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,960
I feel like

208
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,950
I've been stabbed

209
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,120
in the heart.

210
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,920
Take it easy.

211
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,400
She'll come to her senses.

212
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,120
I'll write it.

213
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,180
(Pledge)

214
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,900
(He Jiali)

215
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,520
(I'll have no contact with Tang Weimin.)

216
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,360
(If not, I'll be expelled from my family,)

217
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,460
(give up my name, and cut off my family.)

218
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,120
You've got to do something.

219
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,120
Your son is obsessed

220
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,670
with He Jiali.

221
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,280
Short-sighted woman.

222
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,330
You need a plan.

223
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,120
A plan?

224
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,920
You make me a plan.

225
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,590
Can you force them to break up?

226
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,400
The harder you try, the closer they get.

227
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,430
It's rebellion, understand?

228
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,160
So you're saying

229
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,400
we should leave them alone

230
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,120
and let them do whatever they want?

231
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,790
Of course not.

232
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,360
The point is to do it right.

233
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,550
What?

234
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,030
Business.

235
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,720
What business?

236
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,670
What business?

237
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,120
Go home

238
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,710
and discipline your daughter.

239
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,360
That's what I want to tell you.

240
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,790
Go home and discipline your son.

241
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,520
You're funny.

242
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Why doesn't your daughter

243
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,400
look at herself in the mirror?

244
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,310
She's so ugly.

245
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,310
Her face is like a pig's belly.

246
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,120
How can my son be interested in her?

247
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,710
I heard your son

248
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,880
wouldn't stop chasing her.

249
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,920
You're ridiculous.

250
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,510
Your daughter

251
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,920
gave her picture to my son.

252
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,400
She is throwing herself at him.

253
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,880
Shameless.

254
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,720
Say it again.

255
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,790
Shameless.

256
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,190
What happened?

257
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,270
Jiali, Big Tang beat Dad.

258
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,160
What?

259
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,160
Jiali, where are you going?

260
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
Take revenge.

261
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,660
(Self-reliance)

262
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,350
Big Tang,

263
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,160
come out!

264
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,990
Jiali.

265
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,920
Youmin, close the door!

266
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,950
- Open it!
- Can I talk to you for a second?

267
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
What's wrong with your family?

268
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,750
How can you bully us like that?

269
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Your dad is the bad guy!

270
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,120
- He beat my dad badly.
- Youmin.

271
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,270
My dad is the bad guy?

272
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,950
If you don't make it clear,

273
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm not done with you.

274
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
Jiali, Jiali!

275
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,710
This isn't the time for that.

276
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
It could be a misunderstanding.

277
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,990
You go home first.

278
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll find out what happened

279
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
and meet you again.

280
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,320
He beat my dad and broke his head.

281
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,500
There's no misunderstanding.

282
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,510
Get out of the way!

283
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm not here to see you.

284
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,550
I'm here to see your dad!

285
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,400
Jiali,

286
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,270
be reasonable, ok?

287
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,270
My dad's all bruised

288
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,120
and swollen.

289
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,710
I don't know the details,

290
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,550
but even if your dad

291
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,480
had plenty of reasons,

292
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,880
he shouldn't have beaten him so badly.

293
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,960
Nonsense!

294
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,160
Who beats who?

295
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,120
My dad got hurt, too.

296
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
Jiahuan, calm down.

297
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,270
Jiali, let's avenge Dad today.

298
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,990
A robber acts like a cop.

299
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,190
I'm going to teach all of you

300
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,270
a lesson.

301
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,320
- Jiali!
- Someone help!

302
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,880
These shameless guys are hitting girls.

303
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,990
Aren't you the one who is hitting me?

304
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,720
Our families

305
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,920
will never make up.

306
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,830
Mrs Zhu.

307
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,110
What's up?

308
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,080
My mom went to Chaohu to see my dad.

309
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,160
She's not back yet.

310
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
I know.

311
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
What's up, Mrs. Zhu?

312
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
Qiufang,

313
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I have something to tell you.

314
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,670
You must stay strong.

315
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,510
Mrs. Zhu, tell me.

316
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,360
I can handle it.

317
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
Your dad

318
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,590
is gone.

319
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,100
(Zhang Qiulin)

320
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,360
Qiufang.

321
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,720
Qiufang.

322
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Hang in there.

323
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,440
Kid.

324
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,510
Kid.

325
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,950
You must hold on.

326
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,230
Your brother is here.

327
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,990
Hang in there.

328
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,470
Cry, if you want to.

329
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Don't hold it in.

330
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,640
Qiufang,

331
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,600
have a bite.

332
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,750
I'm not in the mood.

333
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,600
Still, you have to eat.

334
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,990
Now your dad is gone.

335
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,190
The rest of you must stay strong.

336
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,270
What's your next plan?

337
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,640
I don't know.

338
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,800
I'll see what happens.

339
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,710
Actually, my mom

340
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
wants me to get married.

341
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
It's not hard.

342
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,230
You will meet the right guy.

343
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm going home.

344
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,230
Have some food.

345
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,580
(Two months later)

346
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,960
Mrs. Zhang.

347
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,120
- Mrs. Tang.
- Washing clothes, huh?

348
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,750
It's a rare sunny day.

349
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,320
Have a seat.

350
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,400
What's this?

351
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,430
I can't take it.

352
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,590
Take it.

353
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,800
It's not for you.

354
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,230
It's for Qiufang.

355
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,160
I want Qiufang to be my daughter-in-law.

356
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,470
I'll never change my mind.

357
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,030
- No, no.
- Come on, keep it.

358
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,950
No, how can I take this?

359
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,790
Keep it.

360
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,790
Keep it.

361
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,440
Well...

362
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,800
Say something.

363
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,400
What do you think?

364
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,430
I'll listen to you.

365
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,950
I just don't want you to suffer.

366
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,510
I won't suffer.

367
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,230
Who knows what Weimin

368
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,560
truly feels?

369
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,160
Qiufang,

370
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,640
if he really wants to marry you,

371
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
I don't mind.

372
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,080
That's not what you said before.

373
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,560
Circumstances alter cases.

374
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,510
Your dad is gone.

375
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,360
If there's a man

376
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,430
in the world

377
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,030
who will treat you

378
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,080
like a treasure,

379
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,510
Mom would be relieved.

380
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,750
Mom.

381
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,160
Silly girl.

382
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,030
Mom, can I sleep in your bed tonight?

come out.

We can talk about this in person.

386
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,560
You're being unreasonable.

387
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,480
I want a revolution!

I'll tell you what,

393
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,750
give it up.

394
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,080
If you want to be with her,

395
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,160
you'll be an unfilial son.

I'm going to arrange it.

What can you do?

401
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
You're not coming out, right?

402
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,950
Fine. Come on.

403
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,790

Weimin has feelings for you.

418
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,270
He's just bad

419
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,560
at expressing himself.

420
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,800
He is shy.

421

424
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,950
Well, you don't have to talk.

If you do,

426

But the problem is, Weimin...

432
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,800

574
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,430
He Jiali!

575
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,470
Do you know where the girl

576
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,510
who was sitting here lives?

577
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,200
- I don't know.
- No.

578
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,270
Sir,

579
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,920
do you know where

580
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,150
Comrade He Jiali works

581
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,280
or her home address?

582
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,110
I'll check for you. Come with me.

583
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,950
Okay.

584
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,740
(He Jiahuan, He's fourth daughter)

585
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,600
Who do you want?

586
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,350
Does

587
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,990
Comrade He Jiali live here?

588
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,110
(He Jiaxi, He's sixth daughter)

589
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,460
She isn't home. You're...

590
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,950
Zhang Jianguo of the Armed Forces Department.

591
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,990
Did anything happen to Jiali?

592
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,200
No.

593
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,760
I just came to see her.

594
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,510
Are you friends?

595
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,120
Kind of.

596
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,390
Well,

597
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,720
please come in.

598
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,430
You don't have to bring presents.

599
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,350
Sit down.

600
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,560
Sit down, please.

601
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,920
Comrade Jianguo,

602
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,580
how long have you known Jiali?

603
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,580
- It's...
- Where did you meet her?

604
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,680
The Recruitment Registration.

605
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,720
- Where are you from?
- Jing County.

606
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,510
Jing County? Not far from here.

607
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,680
How old are you?

608
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,520
I was born in 1942.

609
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,110
Ten years older than Jiali.

610
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,720
How many siblings do you have?

611
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,560
Just me.

612
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,880
Only child?

613
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,360
I'm home.

614
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,630
Her dad is home.

615
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,470
- Dad.
- This is her dad.

616
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,720
We have a guest.

617
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,760
Changsheng, this is Jiali's friend,

618
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,070
Zhang Jianguo of the Armed Forces Department.

619
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,270
Hello.

620
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,360
- Comrade Zhang Jianguo.
- Yes.

621
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,590
Hello.

622
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,270
Where is Jiali?

623
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,360
Go to the dam

624
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,840
and see if your sister's back.

625
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,280
She's back. Jiali.

626
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
Your good friend is here.

627
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,800
- Jiali.
- Jia...

628
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,550
- Why are you here?
- Jiali.

629
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,840
I came to bring your notebook back.

630
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,470
I didn't realize I'd lost it.

631
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,070
How did you find our house?

632
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,280
I asked Mr. Chen for your address.

633
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,280
Mission accomplished.

634
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,150
I'm leaving.

635
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,110
No hurry.

636
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Stay for a while.

637
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,070
Shall we ask Jianguo to stay for dinner?

638
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,200
Okay.

639
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,720
Would you like to stay for dinner?

640
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,360
- Ok.
- Sit down.

641
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,280
- Girls, go.
- Sit down.

642
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,880
Wash the pig's feet.

643
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,400
Great, we can eat pig's feet today.

644
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,680
- Sit.
- Let me help.

645
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,400
- Sit down.
- No need. I'll go.

646
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,650
- You...
- Sit.

647
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,070
Sit down.

648
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,360
The man

649
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
must be Jiali's new date.

650
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,950
We can tell, too.

651
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,680
Jiali is good.

652
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,950
One guy goes,

653
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,030
and another one comes.

654
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,070
Jiahuan, if you don't work,

655
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,590
you'll get nothing to eat.

656
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,360
It's not yours.

657
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,950
Why can't I eat it?

658
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,150
Jiahuan, stop it.

659
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,430
The fire's almost gone out.

660
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,630
Put some more wood on it.

661
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,840
I don't drink much.

662
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,110
The alcohol content is high.

663
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,840
Dad, I'm getting my sisters to eat.

664
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,470
Go ahead. Try this.

665
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,310
Okay.

666
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,510
Jianguo,

667
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,950
come over when you're free,

668
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,360
- ok?
- Ok.

669
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,550
I think

670
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,760
we get along well,

671
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,600
right?

672
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,550
We kind of hit it off straight away.

673
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,950
Yeah, definitely.

674
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,200
I...

675
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,360
The biggest regret of my life

676
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,030
is not being in the army

677
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,590
or wearing a uniform.

678
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,950
We can serve the people

679
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,470
in any position.

680
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,320
You're right.

681
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,110
- Come on, Jianguo.
- Come on.

682
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,590
Hit it off straight away.

683
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,600
I'm happy.

684
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,150
Look how happy your dad is.

685
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,950
He hasn't been so happy in a while.

686
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,840
We haven't even served the food

687
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,550
and they've almost finished the alcohol.
