=Episode 17=

15
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,130
Then you ask your mother.

16
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,540
What's your opinion?

17
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,770
The man is not for me.

18
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,690
I'm ok with anything.

19
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,580
You and Mom have been
living together these years.

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,210
If she gets remarried,

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,690
I will not leave you alone.

22
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,540
You'll live with me.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,940
That's another story.

24
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,580
If your mother

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,490
wants to get remarried,

26
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,770
that's not bad.

27
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,490
Now, she isn't

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,610
very old.

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,660
(No. 28 Yanhuai Road)

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,140
She's back.

31
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,740
Eat some more.

32
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,810
No. You talk to her.

33
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,490
You're still here.

34
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,090
I'm waiting for you.

35
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,380
I'm worried when Grandma
stays alone at home.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,220
Don't worry.

37
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,820
The room is brightly lit.

38
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,380
What will we have for dinner?

39
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Three dishes.

40
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,580
Mom,

41
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,740
you should've told us

42
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,500
you would do business.

43
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,420
I never thought about doing business.

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,300
Your grandma wanted me
to make Eight Pickled Vegetables.

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,020
I made too many.

46
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,620
It would be a waste of food.

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,300
So, we came up with this idea.

48
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,380
It's your grandma's idea.

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,420
She wants me to go out for fun

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
and kill some time.

51
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,700
Meanwhile,

52
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,500
I can make some extra money

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,460
for family bills.

54
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,460
Isn't that great?

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,420
One more thing.

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,980
Do you remember Ms. Zhang
who lives north?

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,500
She came to me, offering to set you up.

58
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,660
That man is a great match.

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,060
He's a retired veteran.

60
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,540
If you're ok with him,

61
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,180
go meet him.

62
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,220
Your father is watching from above.

63
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,580
I won't get remarried.

64
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,060
Besides,

65
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,820
not all my daughters are married.

66
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,460
How could I

67
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,580
just give myself out?

68
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,260
Do you think I'm old

69
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,180
and useless?

70
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,380
You know what?

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,220
Even if I die,

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,180
I'll have to die in this house.

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,460
Mom, you...

74
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,980
Don't be so serious.

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,820
Did you tell your grandma?

76
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,700
She respects your opinion.

77
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,500
If I get remarried,

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,420
how will your grandma live?

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,260
What were you thinking?

80
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,420
We don't want you to get remarried.

81
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,020
But if you have to leave,

82
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,300
I'll take away Grandma.

83
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,180
If you don't leave,

84
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,860
then continue this stable life

85
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,460
just like always.

86
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,020
Mom, if you're short of money,

87
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
let us know.

88
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,420
The six of us will chip in.

89
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,700
I don't object when you do business.

90
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,300
But you need to watch the timing.

91
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,900
What you want is to kill time

92
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,460
instead of making a fortune.

93
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,300
Anyway, you must prepare

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,460
three meals a day.

95
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,100
Grandma has gallstones.

96
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,820
She needs regular meals.

97
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,620
Without regular meals,

98
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,940
what if she falls ill again?

99
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,220
For God's sake.

100
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,180
He Jiali, over all these years,

101
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,900
I've been making meals for your grandma.

102
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,540
When I simply missed one or two meals,

103
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,020
I was guilty, huh?

104
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,100
Then, you want to expel me.

105
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,580
He Jiali, I see.

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,340
You're combining the two things

107
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,780
just to repress me.

108
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,660
I brought up my kids
and looked after your grandma.

109
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,740
I've been making

110
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,940
all kinds of meals.

111
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,940
What have I got in return?

112
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,260
None of you care for me.

113
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,180
See? You think too much.

114
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,300
Fine. Never mind.

115
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,540
I'll reject Ms. Zhang, ok?

116
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,180
I won't bring it up again.

117
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,940
You'll sell the pickled vegetables.

118
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,580
But you must have a schedule.

119
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,140
Go out and come back on time.

120
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,940
Take it as physical exercise, ok?

121
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,020
Agreed.

122
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,900
(Pickled Vegetables)

123
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,950
Mom is even busier than me.

124
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,090
She doesn't rest on weekends.

125
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,420
A pair of three.

126
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,540
Mom said she earned
a lot more than her pension.

127
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,380
She claimed to make some pocket money.

128
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,460
Is she really short of money?

129
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,540
She could have told me. I have money.

130
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,020
If she takes this

131
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,740
as a serious job,

132
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,380
she'll be exhausted.

133
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,020
Why does Mom sell pickled vegetables?

134
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,940
Why doesn't she

135
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,260
take care of my baby instead?

136
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,740
Care for Mom, will you?

137
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,740
Your mother-in-law should help you.

138
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,740
Zhenmin's parents died.

139
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,340
He has a brother and a sister-in-law.

140
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
He must do something.

141
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,540
I can't count on him.

142
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,460
Then do it yourself.

143
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,540
Nobody helps me, either.

144
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,580
Not everybody is as rich as you.

145
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
She isn't a rich lady.

146
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,460
In my opinion,

147
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,260
Mom shouldn't have given her job to you.

148
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,940
You also took over Dad's.

149
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,780
- Yes.
- He owed me.

150
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,380
Who owed you?

151
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,620
Dad and Mom owe nobody.

152
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,300
Tang Zhenmin.

153
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,940
Tang Zhenmin, will you stop it?

154
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,260
Tang Zhenmin!

155
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,340
Honey.

156
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,620
When did you get back?

157
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,100
Get me an orange.

158
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,260
What's wrong? Are you upset?

159
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,260
Who messed with you?

160
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,780
Nobody did.

161
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm exhausted from work.

162
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm exhausted, too.

163
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,740
Honey, umm...

164
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,580
It's time for dinner.

165
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,180
Aren't you supposed to cook today?

166
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
And the laundry.

167
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
But I'm pregnant.

168
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,500
Why do you want me to cook? I won't.

169
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,220
Hey, don't be unreasonable.

170
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,700
We agreed to cook in turn.

171
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,510
Yesterday, I cooked and did laundry.

172
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,380
Today, it's your turn.

173
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,980
That's your duty, isn't it?

174
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,820
But other pregnant women

175
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,980
aren't as squeamish as you.

176
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
Right?

177
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,420
Other pregnant women are taken care of.

178
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,180
Like my third sister.

179
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,220
She has hired a nanny.

180
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,180
Can you afford one?

181
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,180
Now, you even want me to cook.

182
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,330
We won't cook today.

183
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,940
What will we eat, then?

184
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,460
We'll go out to eat.

185
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,580
Go out? Will you pay?

186
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,420
Yes.

187
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,300
I'll buy dinner for you and my son,

188
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,140
all right?

189
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,060
Fine.

190
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,620
Come on, honey. Let's sit here.

191
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,380
Sit down.

192
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
Honey, you sit here.

193
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,900
I'll order the food.

194
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,540
The same old dishes.

195
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,380
- Beef soup.
- Sit there.

196
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,220
Stay out of my way.

197
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,060
Why?

198
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,020
No, no, no. Cover me.

199
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,660
Jiaxi has a boyfriend.

200
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,020
Where are they?

201
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,100
Do I look good?

202
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,940
Yes.

203
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,260
Will you be full, then?

204
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,780
No.

205
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,580
Then, go order the food.

206
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
Ok.

207
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,620
Don't look. Or they'll see us.

208
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,180
It's ok that she has a boyfriend.

209
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,060
Why are you surprised?

210
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,180
Oh, my God.

211
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,500
You have no idea.

212
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,660
A slight problem will cause big trouble.

213
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,460
What problem? What trouble?

214
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,940
When we got married,
Jiahuan made a scene.

215
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,020
Don't you remember?

216
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,380
She said I was younger

217
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,660
and shouldn't get married first.

218
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,740
Now, even Jiaxi is in a relationship.

219
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,260
If Jiahuan knows that,

220
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,860
she'll make a big scene.

221
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,700
She won't.

222
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,180
I dare not visit your home.

223
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,780
Coward.

224
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,020
I visited your home.

225
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,340
Yes. I'm scared.

226
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,660
What scares you?

227
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,980
Your parents may not like me.

228
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,940
My father died years ago.

229
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,380
I think Jiahuan is doing great.

230
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,260
She lives a good single life.

231
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,460
Then, get to her.

232
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,420
What do you mean?

233
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,180
Do you regret getting married?

234
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,740
Do you regret marrying me?

235
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,260
Leave anytime you want.

236
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,580
Let's break up. Slither back.

237
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,620
Hey, honey. Let me explain.

238
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,660
I'd regret it if I hadn't married you.

239
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,380
When we're eating,

240
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,740
let's not talk about this.

241
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,740
Let's just eat.

242
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,780
I fear your eldest sister the most.

243
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Why?

244
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,460
Everybody knows about her.

245
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,220
She's the backbone of your family.

246
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,580
You all have to obey her.

247
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Not necessarily.

248
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,060
We obey the most reasonable guy.

249
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,220
Besides,

250
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,740
what's the problem
if she doesn't like you?

251
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,380
A man doesn't live

252
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,140
to make everybody like him.

253
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,970
That guy looks like a man.

254
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,580
He is a man.

255
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,940
He looks like a movie star.

256
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,740
He isn't as handsome as me.

257
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,180
What movie star?

258
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,020
If you like him,

259
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,870
get to him.

260
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,140
You look better.

261
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,260
You're the most handsome guy.

262
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,300
Just kidding.

263
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,460
But seriously,

264
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,740
having such a boyfriend

265
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,020
is quite impressive.

266
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,020
Jiaxi, I'm serious.

267
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,180
Shall we try a relationship?

268
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,460
I'm saying

269
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,740
you'll be my girlfriend

270
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,460
and I'll be your boyfriend. Let's try.

271
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,020
No.

272
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,380
Why?

273
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,620
I can be your girlfriend,

274
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,980
but you can't be my boyfriend.

275
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,380
What do you mean?

276
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
I can test you.

277
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,540
But you can't test me.

278
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,420
All right.

279
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,540
Test anything you want.

280
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,940
My hands, arms,

281
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,260
legs, hands, or neck. Anything.

282
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,100
I won't.

283
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,660
They're flirting.

284
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,380
Sir, two bowls of soup.

285
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,460
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

286
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,580
What a coincidence.

287
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,860
You came to the same food stall.

288
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Impressive.

289
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,580
She's finally in love.

290
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,420
That's good.

291
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,180
You don't need to worry, then.

292
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,020
She's really wicked.

293
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,260
She behaves like a tomboy.

294
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,620
Have some shaobing.

295
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,820
How does it taste?

296
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,460
Any better than my dishes?

297
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,860
Not even close.

298
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,180
You just don't want to disappoint me.

299
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Why do I think

300
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,140
this guy also looks like a movie star?

301
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,100
There it goes again.

302
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,940
Which movie star?

303
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,740
He looks like Tom Cruise.

304
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,660
He isn't very young, indeed.

305
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
Thank you.

306
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,620
Stop looking. Eat.

307
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,460
Or it'll get cold.

308
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,260
I'm full.

309
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,140
- Are you full?
- Yes.

310
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,380
- Let's go.
- Ok.

311
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,020
I can't make such a dish at home.

312
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
Fang?

313
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,580
(Lina)

314
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,820
You know her?

315
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,420
Who are you?

316
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,620
Who are you?

317
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,460
We'll talk later.

318
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,220
Who's that woman?

319
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,980
An acquaintance.

320
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,780
You guys must be very acquainted.

321
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,780
She's really arrogant.

322
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,020
She's my ex-wife.

323
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,740
Does it make you think

324
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,220
I'm not a good guy?

325
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,380
Why?

326
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,060
I have a complicated past.

327
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,380
Everybody has a past.

328
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,100
Besides, I know that.

329
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,940
You know I'm divorced?

330
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,180
I've heard about it.

331
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,620
Then?

332
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,460
Then what?

333
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,900
Does your divorce

334
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,060
have anything to do
with our eating together?

335
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,380
I moved here

336
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,760
because I didn't like the way
my neighbors looked at me.

337
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,500
I don't want them to have pity on me.

338
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,660
So, I'm pitiful, too.

339
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm no longer young

340
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,420
and I have no boyfriend.

341
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,740
I'm average-looking, too.

342
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,020
You aren't average-looking.

343
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,980
You're wise and elegant.

344
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,500
Don't be honey-lipped.

345
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,220
I'm being honest.

346
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,580
Don't you think the scar on my face

347
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,780
looks too bad?

348
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,540
Where's the scar?

349
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,620
That's not a scar.

350
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,580
It's not even as long as my nail.

351
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,980
- And the crescent...
- Jiahuan.

352
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,180
Walking around, huh?

353
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,580
Fang, you're also here.

354
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,220
Every day, you eat together

355
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,180
and walking around.

356
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,540
When will you get married?

357
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,140
- Umm...
- Come on.

358
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,060
Ok, kidding aside.

359
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,420
Remember to pay the water bills.

360
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,660
I should go.

361
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,300
Jiahuan.

362
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,220
How about

363
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,980
we eat separately?

364
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,620
I'll cook and deliver the meals.

365
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,180
In case people gossip.

366
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,420
Are you scared?

367
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,860
That's not what I mean.

368
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,340
Tell me if you're scared.

369
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,220
I'm not scared unless you are.

370
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,820
That's it, then.

371
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,100
Fine.

372
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,820
Fang Tao.

373
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
I have a question.

374
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,580
Go ahead.

375
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
Do you still love her?

376
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,940
- Who?
- Your ex-wife.

377
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,660
Jiahuan!

378
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,060
I...

379
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,700
Jiahuan, do you misunderstand something?

380
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,740
No.

381
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,940
Did I say anything wrong?

382
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,660
No.

383
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,940
Then why are you angry?

384
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm not angry.

385
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,580
Jiahuan, open the door.

386
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,700
If I'm wrong, I can apologize.

387
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,300
You're not wrong.

388
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,500
You have a bad habit.

389
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,580
You always say the opposite.

390
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,420
Nonsense.

391
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,180
I always say what I mean.

392
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,340
That's not true.

393
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,900
For example, you don't like
the end of chicken feet.

394
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,380
But you eat a lot of it every time.

395
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,180
You say you like cabbage.

396
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,860
But you never eat any.

397
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,780
You say you don't like cooking.

398
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,260
Actually, you're scared of fire.

399
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,300
So, you asked me about my ex-wife.

400
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,220
Do you actually...?

401
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,500
What's your point?

402
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,660
Open the door first.

403
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,740
I don't love her.

404
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,780
She didn't love me a long time ago.

405
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,900
I need to find a way out.

406
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,540
I can still love.

407
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,660
I also deserve to be loved.

408
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,540
So?

409
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
So,

410
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,500
I want you to give me a way out.

411
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,380
I can give you no way out.

412
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,060
I'll make it, anyway.

413
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,780
He Jiahuan,

414
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm in love with you.

415
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,780
I'll think about that.

416
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,380
Today's beef soup tastes too bad.

417
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,700
I'll fry an egg for you

418
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,140
with some soy sauce.

419
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,180
Feed chickens if you're free.

420
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,670
Still working on housework?

421
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,820
There's big trouble.

422
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,600
Don't be ridiculous.

423
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,580
I'm not being ridiculous.

424
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,140
This is a big problem.

425
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,580
It concerns our happiness.

426
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,800
As their sister,

427
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,180
I have to tell our mother.

428
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,180
What is it?

429
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,620
Jiahuan and Jiaxi both have a boyfriend.

430
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,660
Oh, my God.

431
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,780
I saw them with my eyes.

432
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,100
One looks like Tom Cruise.

433
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,580
The other resembles a star, too.

434
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,940
Which one looks like Tom Cruise?

435
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,740
Jiahuan's boyfriend.

436
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,620
Even the chickens are curious.

437
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Bring him back.

438
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,130
Seasoning.

439
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,700
Radish. Green pepper.

440
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,580
Vegetables.

441
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,500
Anise.

442
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,260
Oh, my God.

443
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,890
Dear Mom,

444
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,380
you're as busy as a gyroscope.

445
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,180
People may think
we don't take care of you.

446
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,420
I don't care if you take care of me.

447
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,620
I just do my own business.

448
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,060
One can never count on anyone else.

449
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,140
What are you talking about?

450
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,420
I give you my word now.

451
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,780
You can count on me.

452
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,940
There won't be a problem.

453
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,460
It's too early to say so.

454
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,740
You're still young.

455
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,820
You're just lucky

456
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,020
to have this mother.

457
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,260
No exaggeration,

458
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,340
a woman like me

459
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,820
has witnessed all times and all places.

460
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,580
What makes you say so?

461
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Born in an old society,

462
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,020
I grew up in the PRC.

463
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,340
The old society and the PRC

464
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,620
are different times.

465
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,180
I was a daughter.

466
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,820
I was a wife.

467
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,060
I am a daughter-in-law

468
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,180
and I am a mother.

469
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,340
Since my husband died,

470
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,020
I've been looking after his mother.

471
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,620
What other women can do that?

472
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,100
Mom,

473
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,540
you're great.

474
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,980
So, so great.

475
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,340
Exactly.

476
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,340
I'll learn from you, Mom.

477
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,380
I will always take care of you.

478
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,020
No one can count on his children.

479
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,020
Think about Zhang Qiulin and his wife.

480
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,620
They're going to the USA,

481
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,820
the other side of the Pacific Ocean.

482
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,300
Ms. Liu can't count on them.

483
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,380
That's different.

484
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,780
He's a son.

485
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,380
But daughters are thoughtful.

486
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Jiaxi.

487
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,540
Be honest with Mom.

488
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,180
Do you have a boyfriend?

489
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,660
No.

490
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,420
Someone saw you on the street.

491
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,620
Who did?

492
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,380
How gossipy.

493
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,580
It's ok. Tell me about it.

494
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,780
Do I know him?

495
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,460
He's just a friend.

496
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,340
Forget it.

497
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,020
You just promised to take care of me.

498
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,780
Now, you aren't even honest with me.

499
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,220
He's my master's son.

500
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,380
Wang Huaimin's son?

501
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,780
No way. That's unacceptable.

502
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,860
Why?

503
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,140
Come on, kid.

504
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,380
I totally know what kind of woman

505
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,780
Wang Huaimin is.

506
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,820
Ordinary guys are no match for her.

507
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,860
She can be your master.

508
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,580
But she can't be your mother-in-law.

509
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,180
I won't live with her.

510
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,780
Her son won't listen to you.

511
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,180
He'll listen to her.

512
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,460
If you marry him,
you'll have a tough time.

513
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,820
I understand.

514
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,340
Go on with the accounts.

515
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,340
(Black Tea House)

516
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
Are you leaving tomorrow?

517
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,460
Yes, by plane.

518
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,620
When will you return?

519
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,180
It's hard to tell.

520
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
In the future,

521
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,420
you'll have Western food and clothes.

522
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,780
But I'm always Chinese.

523
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,980
Have a good trip.

524
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,980
Thank you.

525
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,020
Jiahuan,

526
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,340
before,

527
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,420
we misunderstood each other.

528
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,740
It was my problem.

529
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,020
You were innocent.

530
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,780
But what's gone is gone.

531
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,380
I want you to be ok.

532
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,260
I'm doing good.

533
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,500
Yes. You're a very nice girl.

534
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,860
You deserve the best life.

535
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,540
Jiahuan,

536
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,980
it's very dry lately.

537
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,700
I made you lung-heat-clearing pear soup.

538
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,300
See?

539
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,700
I'm leaving soon.

540
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,780
I don't know when I can come back.

541
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,660
So, I'm here

542
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,300
to solve our misunderstanding.

543
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,660
You have to know this.

544
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,380
Since I was little,

545
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,180
you've been my best friend.

546
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,460
Say no more.

547
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
Are we still friends?

548
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,660
Equal friends.

549
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,500
Yes.

550
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,380
We're equal friends.

551
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,980
You have my blessing.

552
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,860
So do you.

553
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,860
Was Weiguo's mother
buried in her hometown?

554
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,900
Everything is settled.

555
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Drop this. Let's talk about Jiahuan.

556
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,020
What if she has one-sided love?

557
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,540
Does that man have feelings for her?

558
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,780
I'm not sure.

559
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,660
Indeed, Jiahuan

560
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,940
should get married soon.

561
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,580
Or it'll be a big problem.

562
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,180
If they love each other, it's ok.

563
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,060
As long as they're a good match.

564
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,620
There's one problem.

565
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,620
That man

566
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,980
is divorced.

567
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
That's not acceptable.

568
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Mom,

569
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,420
give me

570
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,060
the household register.

571
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,380
What do you want it for?

572
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,980
You're always rash.

573
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,220
In big cases,

574
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,420
you must think carefully.

575
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,380
I've made up my mind.

576
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,180
He's divorced. Does he have children?

577
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,580
No. Weiguo asked about him.

578
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,260
He's said to be very honest.

579
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,340
Honest?

580
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,380
Then why is he divorced?

581
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,220
Just because of that,

582
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,980
his ex-wife betrayed him.

583
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,740
What do you mean?

584
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,780
How did she betray him?

585
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,420
His ex-wife

586
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,660
got another man.

587
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,740
Oh, my God.

588
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,540
She cheated on him.

589
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,380
Jiahuan,

590
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,740
why do you

591
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,060
want the household register?

592
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,980
For work.

593
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,220
It's not with me.

594
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,820
Jiali has it now.

595
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,740
Why does she have it?

596
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,500
Do you want it badly?

597
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,140
Yes.

598
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,820
I'll call her and ask her
to bring it here.

599
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,260
Explain to her clearly.

600
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,580
It's for the honor employee.

601
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,380
I need to be registered.

602
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,820
I know what to say.

603
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,220
But will you be it?

604
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,740
Don't say that. I'll certainly be it.

605
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,260
What's his job?

606
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,220
Where does he work?

607
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,180
He works with the fleet
at the Grain Bureau.

608
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,340
Is he a driver?

609
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,180
He's a captain.

610
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,940
How old is he?

611
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,180
Five or six years older than Jiahuan.

612
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,380
No. He isn't good enough.

613
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,860
They aren't a match.

614
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,380
That's what I told her before.

615
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,420
But I'm afraid she will...

616
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,500
She will what?

617
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,780
Will she follow Jiayi's path?

618
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
We have to stop her.

619
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,620
Hello.

620
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,020
Who do you want?

621
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,530
He Jiali.

622
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,180
You're wanted on the phone.

623
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,980
Be right there.

624
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,980
She's exactly imitating Jiayi.

625
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,380
She wants the register

626
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,740
to get married secretly.

627
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,260
The same old trick.

628
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,940
She asked for this.

629
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,980
She'll have to suffer.

630
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,860
Jiahuan is way too stubborn.

631
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,170
She doesn't like

632
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,660
whoever we introduced to her.

633
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,580
She loves the man she chooses,

634
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,660
even if he's divorced.

635
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,820
It's just like eating stinky tofu.

636
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,140
One may like it while others hate it.

637
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,380
She can get married.

638
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,980
Or if Jiaxi gets married before her,

639
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,460
she'll be really upset.

640
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,780
Later, let's not criticize her.

641
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,250
Let's be reasonable.

642
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,020
That's right. Jiahuan

643
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,140
has to be coaxed.

644
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,820
Yes. Grandma is right.

645
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,860
(A harmonious family prospers.)

646
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,220
Jiahuan, you're back.

647
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,220
Mom, Grandma.

648
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,660
There you are, sisters.

649
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,980
Jiali.

650
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,060
Did you bring back
the household register?

651
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,340
What do you want it for?

652
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,740
Didn't I tell you?

653
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,780
For honor employee.

654
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,540
What kind of event

655
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,660
needs the household register?

656
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,820
It's required in our financial system.

657
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,420
It's a mere formality.

658
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,860
You won't understand.

659
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,380
It's held in the district office.

660
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,900
For Xiaonian's residence change.

661
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,180
We haven't got it back yet.

662
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,580
Which district office?

663
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,620
How about this?

664
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,820
I'll fetch it tomorrow
and send it to your office.

665
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,180
Don't bother.

666
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,420
I'll go fetch it myself.

667
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,780
Can I go now?

668
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,300
Which office?

669
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,660
You want to go now?

670
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,460
Why are you in such a hurry?

671
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,980
Why on earth

672
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,460
do you want that?

673
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,860
Come over and talk.

674
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,780
Come over here.

675
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,820
Jiawen, you...

676
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,580
Shall I leave now?

677
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,420
Jiawen has nothing to do with this.

678
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,380
Jiahuan, rumors about you
are everywhere.

679
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,620
You should confess.

680
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,860
What's exactly going on?

681
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,180
None of your business.

682
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,260
Jiahuan,

683
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,980
will you follow Jiayi's path

684
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,140
and do what she did before?

685
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,020
With the register,

686
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,260
you'll get married secretly.

687
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,660
If you do this,

688
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,260
people will think less of you.

689
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,460
Do you understand?

690
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,940
Meixin, talk nicely.

691
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,420
Jiahuan.

692
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,980
Here.

693
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,860
Tell us what happened.

694
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,060
Then, we'll discuss it.

695
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,380
Right?

696
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,300
Well, umm...

697
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,740
I have a boyfriend.

698
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,540
I like him.

699
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,820
I want to marry him.

700
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,420
That's good.

701
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,060
Why do you keep it from us?

702
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,140
Yeah.

703
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm afraid you'll disapprove.

704
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,980
We do everything for your own good.

705
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,140
But the procedures are necessary.

706
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,540
Take him back to see Grandma and Mom.

707
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,180
They'll know about him.

708
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,180
It's also the respect for them.

709
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,700
Besides,

710
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,980
we'll be a family.

711
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,180
We need to get along.

712
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,780
Your boyfriend isn't a bad guy, huh?

713
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,260
Is he unpresentable?

714
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,100
No way.

715
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,820
Grandma,

716
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,780
he's timid.

717
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,020
Look at them.

718
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,420
What if they scare him?

719
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,340
Then, you tell us.

720
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,180
What is he like?

721
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,140
You know everything.

722
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,580
Right.

723
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,860
He's divorced.

724
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,100
So what?

725
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,060
Whether you approve,

726
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,540
I'll be with him.

727
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,980
Be patient.

728
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,980
Getting a divorce is legal.

729
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,820
The point is why he's divorced

730
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,420
and if he's reliable.

731
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,380
He is, of course.

732
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,580
He's my treasure.

733
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,580
Treasure?

734
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,500
Fine. This weekend,

735
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,260
take your treasure
to see Grandma and Mom.

736
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
Ok.

737
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,620
Take him back this weekend.

738
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,980
For dinner.

739
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,380
Yeah. That's good.

740
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,220
You'll come, too.

741
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,220
Take him here.

742
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,060
Do you hear?

743
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,060
Are you nervous?

744
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,260
No.

745
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,380
There's a long but bright way to go.

746
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,780
Shall we get in?

747
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,620
Yes.

748
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,460
Wait a minute.

749
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
What's wrong?

750
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,940
You aren't nervous, are you?

751
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm not.

752
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,380
My coat is.

753
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,380
Let's get in.

754
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,980
Ok.

755
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,220
Mom, Tom Cruise.

756
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,380
He doesn't look like Tom Cruise,

757
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,460
but a little bit like Brad Pitt.

758
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,900
Here.

759
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,020
Have melon seeds.

760
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,260
Thank you, Grandma.

761
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,300
Fang,

762
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,500
you and Jiahuan
moved a little fast, huh?

763
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,340
I fell in love

764
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,820
with her at first sight.

765
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,460
I adore her, I mean.

766
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,380
I got to love him in time.

767
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,060
Fang,

768
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,060
introduce yourself.

769
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,860
Mom, you know about him.

770
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,700
That's different.

771
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,060
Ask Fang to introduce himself.

772
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,780
My name is Fang Tao.

773
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,820
I was born in 1960.

774
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,580
You're as old as my second sister.

775
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,140
He looks more mature than her.

776
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,380
You're six years older than Jiahuan.

777
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,900
Four years, I think.

778
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,780
Six years.

779
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,380
I'm a driver at the Grain Bureau.

780
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,260
I work in the wind and sun.

781
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,420
What about your family?

782
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,220
My parents died a few years ago.

783
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,780
I have an elder brother

784
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,940
and a younger brother.

785
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,340
I'm the second son.

786
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,020
You're just like my husband.

787
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,980
The middle child.

788
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,260
Fang,

789
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,060
tell us your advantages
and disadvantages.

790
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,500
Grandma,

791
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,140
Mom is like interrogating a prisoner.

792
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,140
When Mom asks...

793
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,180
Madam, I mean.

794
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,140
When Madam asks, I'll be honest.

795
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,260
As for me,

796
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,180
honesty is my advantage.

797
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,980
But I'm being way too honest.

798
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
Another disadvantage.

799
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,020
I'm divorced.

800
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,860
My daughter Jiahuan

801
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,820
can be very rash.

802
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,060
If the two of you get married,

803
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,540
go easy on her.

804
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,620
I'm not that rash.

805
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,180
Come on.

806
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,420
Be patient.

807
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,780
Everybody's here.

808
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,380
- All of you.
- Ouyang.

809
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,580
Honey, give me the key.

810
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,660
I forgot to bring mine.

811
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,940
Ouyang.

812
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,620
Fang?

813
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,740
What are you doing here?

814
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,580
Paying a visit.

815
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,540
You know each other?

816
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
Yes.

817
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,980
We play on the same team.

818
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,860
He and his brothers
play basketball very well.

819
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,060
Lina didn't come with you?

820
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,160
Hey.

821
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,740
Aren't you back together?

822
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,860
When's the big day?

823
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,180
Don't be ridiculous.

824
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,820
- Fang.
- Jiahuan.

825
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,420
What's going on, Fang?

826
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,580
Isn't it obvious?

827
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
He's cheating on Jiahuan.

828
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,540
He'll be doomed.

829
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,580
No, Xiaoling. I...

830
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,060
How dare you hurt a pregnant woman?

831
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,580
Come on. Explain everything.

832
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,460
What's going on here?

833
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,140
See?

834
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,980
I would rather she had no boyfriend.

835
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,140
There are a lot of liars

836
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,380
just like Fang.

837
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,940
So, free love has to be avoided.

838
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,260
We need matchmakers.

839
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,860
They know everything.

840
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,580
I don't think Fang is a liar.

841
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,260
People pretend.

842
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,540
You can't judge a book by its cover.

843
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,340
Calm down now.

844
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Let's figure out what really happened.

845
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,020
Why? That's not necessary.

846
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,860
They must stop right here.

847
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,380
Jiahuan must move back home.

848
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,380
We'll watch her.

849
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Mom, Grandma.

850
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,180
Come on in.

851
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,660
Go watch Jiahuan.

852
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,980
Why? Will she kill herself?

853
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,260
That's what we fear.

854
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,220
Jiahuan, let it go.

855
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,260
You'll have another man.

856
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,100
Get out.

857
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,300
Ok.

858
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,820
I said, get out!

859
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Who are you talking to?

860
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,300
Jiawen.

861
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,900
Are you still upset?

862
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,060
No.

863
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,700
Weiguo and I

864
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,500
will get your luggage back home.

865
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,700
You stay here for a few days.

866
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,100
I'll get my luggage back myself.

867
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,660
Why? Don't want to leave him?

868
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,940
Even if we break up,

869
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,620
he deserves a chance to explain.

870
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,860
It makes sense.

871
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,500
What did Mom and Grandma say?

872
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,940
Nothing.

873
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
They want the two of you to calm down.
