The food isn't even served yet,

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,120
but the bottle of wine
is almost empty.

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,920
He's even a cadre.

18
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,510
Yeah, he's a cadre.

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,920
What are you thinking about?

20
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
What am I thinking about?

21
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,920
What are you thinking about?

22
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,910
Mom.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm not thinking about anything.
Hurry up.

24
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,110
Alright, alright.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,040
Now that you know the way,

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,680
you can come over anytime.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Alright, alright.

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,790
You know where we live, right?

29
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,070
I do. It's not far from here.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,630
Then I'll head back now.

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,700
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
Jiali, walk Jianguo out.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,950
That's not necessary.

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
No, no.

35
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,230
- Dad.
- Her dad is right.

36
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,830
- It's dark.
- She has to walk you out.

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,700
Go, go.

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,610
Dad.

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,470
Just go.

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,740
- Go on.
- Let me walk you out.

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,920
Mr. and Mrs. He, goodbye.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,340
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

43
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,550
Remember to come again.

44
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,550
Next time, no need to bring trotters.

45
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,440
Sorry about tonight.

46
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,760
Our family is too big.

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,720
It was noisy.

48
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,790
How could you say that?

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,830
It was lively

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,550
and full of energy.

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,760
I admire it.

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,350
No, I should say I envy it.

53
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,390
Envy?

54
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,600
You have parents who love you

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
and lively and adorable sisters,

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
and your family's food is delicious.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,300
The liquor is good too.

58
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,950
These are things

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,550
I've never had.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,950
Were you born from a crack in a rock?

61
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm an orphan.

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,350
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,850
There's nothing to be sorry about.

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,160
Being part of a lively dinner

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,350
like tonight is my honor.

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
Thank you.

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,240
I know the way from here.

68
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,600
No need to walk me further.

69
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,350
Jiali,

70
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,760
can we meet again?

71
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,630
Of course, I'm not dead yet.

72
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,440
Good.

73
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,910
Goodbye.

74
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,230
Goodbye.

75
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,310
I really like that kid.

76
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,080
Compared to that Tang guy,

77
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,430
he's a thousand times better.

78
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,720
He's a soldier,

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,350
looks good, has great character

80
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,670
and a good personality,

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,040
and he can actually chat with you.

82
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,310
Most importantly,

83
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,310
he's an orphan.

84
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,840
That means no in-laws
to deal with, right?

85
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,750
If they end up together,

86
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,600
he'd be completely devoted

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,640
to our family.

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,520
Hurry up.

89
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,880
My eyes hurt.

90
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,430
What do you think?

91
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,400
That's your plan.

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Do you even know

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,790
how they feel about each other?

94
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,990
I don't know about Jiali,

95
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,750
but I can tell that Jianguo

96
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,080
definitely has feelings for Jiali.

97
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,310
Then go ask Jiali.

98
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,520
You're her mother.

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,750
You should analyze this for her.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,350
He's such a young man.

101
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,640
She can't let him go.

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,720
What do we do?

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
Let's find a matchmaker.

104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,840
I'll talk to Ms. Liu.

105
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
Absolutely not.

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,840
He's a military officer.

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Matchmaking is outdated now.

108
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,160
People nowadays believe in free love.

109
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,230
Don't mess around.

110
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,160
If Jiali doesn't take the initiative,

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,310
we can.

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
We take the initiative?

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,670
Every now and then,

114
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,550
let's invite Jianguo over

115
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,550
for a meal and a chat.

116
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,990
Feelings grow over time.

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
Smart.

118
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,760
Anyway, you're free

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560
(Row 8, Seat 5; Row 8, Seat 7)
this Sunday.

120
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,380
Go watch a movie.

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,300
After the movie,

122
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,750
if there's time,

123
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,280
go to the park,

124
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,750
and maybe row a boat.

125
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,310
By dinnertime,

126
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,140
bring him back for a meal.

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,950
I'll be home watching my sisters
on Sunday.

128
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,190
You take Mom to the movie.

129
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,160
We don't need that.

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,280
- The tickets are for you two.
- Yes.

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,990
The tickets are hard to get these days.

132
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,350
I don't know him that well.

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,550
How could you not?

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,790
I already know him well.

135
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,550
You're unbelievable.

136
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,960
You said you wanted to date,

137
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,630
but now you say
you don't know him well.

138
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm not dating him.

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,790
I think you're the one
who likes Zhang Jianguo.

140
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,420
How can you say that?

141
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,520
You're getting insensible.

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,750
I'm insensible?

143
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,750
Zhang Jianguo might be wondering

144
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,840
what's going on with you guys.

145
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,370
He just came over once by accident,

146
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,160
and now you're making
a big deal out of it.

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,440
What do you mean "by accident"?

148
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,650
The history of the world

149
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,260
moves forward through accidents.

150
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,840
Personal fate also changes drastically
through coincidences.

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Coincidence and inevitability
go hand in hand.

152
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,350
Dad, I think you've changed.

153
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,550
You've become abnormal.

154
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,750
But it's true.

155
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,600
We can't ask Jiali
to invite him to a movie.

156
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,720
She's a girl after all.

157
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,670
Isn't that too forward?

158
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,920
Exactly, Mom.

159
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,110
No, no, Mom, you...

160
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,050
Don't mess around here.

161
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,430
What's wrong with it?

162
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,330
What's the big deal?

163
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,230
Just say the union
gave out tickets at work,

164
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,990
and there's an extra one, right?

165
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,870
Then ask Jianguo if he's free.

166
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,710
Right?

167
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,430
It's totally natural.

168
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,350
Smart! That's a great idea.

169
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,400
Just say they're from the union.

170
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
That's okay, right?

171
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,160
(Row 8, Seat 5; Row 8, Seat 7)
No way.

172
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,160
I don't even know
what kind of person he is.

173
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
What kind of person?

174
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,430
A soldier. A good man.

175
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,040
A fellow wanderer in this world.

176
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
Changsheng, what's the movie?

177
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
Walter Defends Sarajevo.

178
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Let's go ourselves.

179
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,060
(Blessings)

180
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,190
Jiali.

181
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,990
Why do you keep avoiding me?

182
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,040
Can you move aside?

183
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,020
(Tang Weimin, Tang's first son)

184
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,310
I know you still like me.

185
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,550
Why are you doing this?

186
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,900
Relationships between people

187
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,530
aren't just about liking each other.

188
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,520
We're not kids anymore.

189
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,790
We aren't right for each other.

190
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,160
Just because of your family?

191
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,640
Your family is like a turtle shell.

192
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,350
Are you going to carry it
for a lifetime?

193
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,520
That's my choice.

194
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,800
I wish you happiness.

195
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,400
Only you can make me happy.

196
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,120
(People's Post Office)
That's our parents' problem,

197
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,120
right?

198
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,070
Happiness should be in our own hands.

199
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,470
- Stop following me.
- Listen.

200
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,760
- Let me explain.
- Let go.

201
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,440
- Their generation and ours...
- Let go.

202
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,390
- Let go!
- Let go!

203
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
What are you doing?

204
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Who are you?

205
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,950
I'm her friend.

206
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,570
What friend? I've never seen you before.

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,470
- Don't get physical.
- Move.

208
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
Move.

209
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,370
I told you not to get physical.

210
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,460
- Let go of me!
- Let go.

211
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,120
Let go!

212
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,830
Stop following me.

213
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
Just go.

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,760
Fine, fine.

215
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,470
I won't stoop to your level.

216
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,550
- Wait.
- What do you want?

217
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,280
You want another round?

218
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,760
No, no, don't misunderstand.

219
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,280
I don't want to fight you.

220
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,430
I know

221
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,880
you like Jiali.

222
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,430
But Jiali doesn't seem to feel the same.

223
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,470
You don't know

224
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
what we've been through.

225
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,470
No matter what you've been through,

226
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,520
that's all in the past.

227
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,120
This is the PRC now.

228
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,510
Marriage is free.
Men and women are equal.

229
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,070
Jiali's relationships and marriage

230
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,520
are up to her alone.

231
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,710
No one else can interfere.

232
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,830
Thanks for the lecture.

233
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,370
Like I needed you to tell me that.

234
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,720
Are you mad?

235
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,600
No.

236
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
Jiali,

237
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,830
are we friends?

238
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,160
If you ever need help

239
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,310
with anything,

240
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,670
come find me anytime.

241
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
I live on that street.

242
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
I know.

243
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,470
What did you say to Jianguo?

244
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,870
Did you ask him or not?

245
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,710
I asked. He's not coming.

246
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,640
What can I do?

247
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,310
Why? He's busy on Sunday?

248
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,150
I don't believe it.

249
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,830
I'll go ask him myself.

250
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,590
Go ahead.

251
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,070
Stop eating that.

252
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,030
Why?

253
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,880
How can you behave like this?

254
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,280
Save it for when Jianguo comes.

255
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,070
I barely had two pieces!

256
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,150
Come on.

257
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,430
Dad, if Jianguo doesn't come,

258
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,920
are we supposed to stop living?

259
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,320
I haven't even known him that long.

260
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,170
What's not long enough?

261
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,100
I haven't known him long enough.

262
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,040
How long is long enough?

263
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,820
The man you've known longer

264
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,880
isn't even close to Jianguo's level.

265
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
Exactly.

266
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,460
What matters
is the real qualities, right?

267
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,340
Let's not nitpick over small things.

268
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,120
Focus on the main issue.

269
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,900
Enough playing. Did you hear me?

270
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,380
You're all getting
way ahead of yourselves.

271
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,220
I know exactly where I stand.

272
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,820
What would he even see in me?

273
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,540
He Jiali,

274
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
in my eyes,

275
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,820
you are the best.

276
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,460
You're beautiful

277
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,340
and steady.

278
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
Those are great qualities.

279
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,540
You're good in every way.

280
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,540
Jianguo really cares about you.

281
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,300
We've long noticed it.

282
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,180
Your attitude is the key here.

283
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,560
How about I ask him to make it clear

284
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,940
when he comes later?

285
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,970
What do you think?

286
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,870
Dad.

287
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,780
What's there to be embarrassed about?

288
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,980
Think about it.

289
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,240
Jianguo is a revolutionary soldier,

290
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,010
and you are one
of the revolutionary masses.

291
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,100
You're both revolutionary.

292
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,140
You two

293
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,580
would make a glorious
revolutionary family.

294
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,140
Dad, Mom's talking nonsense!

295
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,220
That's right.

296
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,100
- Jianguo!
- Jianguo!

297
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm here.

298
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
I brought gifts.

299
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,860
Jianguo's here!

300
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,620
Jianguo!

301
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,780
Jianguo's here!

302
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,740
Come on, Jianguo.

303
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,820
We've been waiting for you
to open this bottle.

304
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,860
Well, here I am.

305
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,340
Mrs. He.

306
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,740
- Jiali.
- Jianguo.

307
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,140
By the way,

308
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,820
I brought some things over.

309
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,460
Why bring gifts again?

310
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,220
Mrs. He, this is for you.

311
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,860
What's this?

312
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,340
Take it.

313
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,860
They won't fit me.

314
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,080
Give them to Jiali.

315
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,760
Keep them.

316
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,900
- Such nice shoes.
- No, no.

317
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,060
Mrs. He, these are for you.

318
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,020
They're sturdy.

319
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,140
Just take them.

320
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,340
Thank you.

321
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,820
There's more.

322
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,060
This is for Jiawen.

323
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,260
Thank you, Jianguo.

324
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,180
Jiayi.

325
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,140
Thank you, Jianguo.

326
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,380
What about me?

327
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,500
- You have one.
- Me too!

328
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,440
Hold on.

329
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,580
Here you go.

330
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,520
Thank you, Jianguo.

331
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,740
(Liu Xiaoling, He's fifth daughter)

332
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,780
- Learn to read.
- Mine.

333
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,260
- Jianguo, sit here.
- Thanks.

334
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,380
I have a few more dishes.

335
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,380
Changsheng,

336
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,620
this is for you.

337
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,260
I have one too?

338
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,460
(He Jiaxi)
And Jiaxi's.

339
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,540
Thank you, Jianguo!

340
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,940
Why isn't there one for Jiali?

341
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
I don't need a gift.

342
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,180
- No need.
- You have one.

343
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,020
We all have one.

344
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,340
I prepared one

345
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,740
for Jiali too.

346
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,220
What is it?

347
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,740
What is this?

348
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,900
Open it and see.

349
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,140
- A watch!
- A Shanghai-brand watch!

350
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,860
No, no, this is too expensive.

351
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,820
I can't accept it.

352
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,060
Consider it a birthday gift.

353
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,260
But my birthday isn't here yet.

354
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,100
I can't accept it.

355
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
Years ago,

356
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,940
the day you signed up for the army

357
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,120
happened to be your birthday.

358
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,220
Think of this
as a belated birthday gift.

359
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,060
- Put it on.
- I can't accept it.

360
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,900
I can't accept it.

361
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,800
It's too expensive.

362
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,060
You kids...

363
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,060
Just put it on.

364
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,220
Careful, careful!

365
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,100
Looks great!

366
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,060
Beautiful!

367
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,220
So pretty.

368
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,620
Jianguo, come on, cheers.

369
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,060
- Sure.
- Take it easy.

370
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,380
Jianguo,

371
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,140
there are no outsiders here.

372
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
You know.

373
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,340
Just make it clear.

374
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,940
What exactly

375
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,420

What's wrong with that?

380
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,580
Jianguo is an honest man.

382

I've prepared for this.

He came prepared.

384
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,500
Jianguo, sit. Just sit and talk.

385
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,500
Alright.

386

Comrade He Jiali and I

387
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,820
first met in the spring of 1969.

388
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,060
She wanted to enlist,

full of enthusiasm.

When I saw her,

391
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,100
I felt she was different
from other women.

392
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,940
She had the spirit

we met again.

397
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,260
I strongly felt

398
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,820
that Comrade He Jiali

399
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,940
would make
an excellent revolutionary partner.

400
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,780
I developed

401
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,140
a deep admiration for her

402
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
and hope for further development.

403
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,140
I have reported this

404
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,100

at my workplace.

564
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,020
From now on,

565
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,780
your dad will be my dad,

566
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,740
your mom will be my mom,

567
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,340
your sisters will be my sisters,

568
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
and your home will be my home.

569
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,260
That's all I have to say.

570
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,780
Jiali?

571
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,740
Say something.

572
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,660
No.

573
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,420
Why?

574
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,300
Words alone don't count.

575
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,640
I need the betrothal gifts
and the forty-eight legs.

576
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,740
I need everything.

577
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,420
I know.

578
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
You've got a watch.

579
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,820
You still need a bicycle,
a sewing machine,

580
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,520
and a radio for the gifts.

581
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,340
Four legs from a table.

582
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,180
16 legs from four chairs.

583
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,980
Four legs from a cabinet.

584
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,420
And four legs from a bed.

585
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,430
Enough, you sound ridiculous.

586
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,780
Jianguo,

587
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,620
Jiali's just teasing you.

588
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,020
Jiali, Jianguo is an honest man.

589
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,260
You can't tease him like that.

590
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,540
Jianguo,

591
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,980
our family doesn't care

592
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,180
about those material things.

593
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,780
As long as you wholeheartedly
treat Jiali well,

594
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,880
that's all that matters.

595
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,740
I can swear to Chairman Mao

596
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,320
that I'll love He Jiali for a lifetime.

597
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,520
Jiawen, Jiayi, Jiahuan,
Xiaoling, and Jiaxi,

598
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,340
each of you say something auspicious

599
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,020
for your sister and brother-in-law.

600
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,740
I wish Jiali a long

601
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,780
and happy marriage.

602
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,300
I wish Jiali many children soon.

603
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,580
They already said everything.

604
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,940
I have nothing left to say.

605
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,100
Just pick a nice one.

606
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,340
Then I hope Jiali never has to worry
about food and drink

607
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,620
and gets to eat meat every week.

608
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,780
I wish Jiali a double salary.

609
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,410
Jiali, you have to have a son.

610
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,020
Alright, look at the camera.

611
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,980
Come on.

612
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,100
Bride, cheer up.

613
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,540
Smile.

614
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,180
Come on. One, two, three.

615
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:45,460
(Winter, 1975)

616
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,820
Look at this. Jiali's new home.

617
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,380
Jiali, this house is great.

618
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,300
So bright.

619
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,220
It faces south.

620
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,300
It has two rooms.

621
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,100
(He Jiayi, He's third daughter)
I love this balcony.

622
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,140
I can do my hair here in the morning.

623
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,740
Who are you trying to impress?

624
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,940
What do you know?

625
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,700
When will I finally grow up?

626
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,700
(He Jiawen)
Haven't you already grown up?

627
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,820
I want to grow up too.

628
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,940
Jiawen will get married after Jiali.

629
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,700
Then it'll be Jiayi's turn.

630
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,820
And then it'll be my turn.

631
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,140
Pay me some respect.

632
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,220
I'm your older sister.

633
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,820
Fine, you're my sister.

634
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,620
Pay me some respect.

635
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,100
Sure.

636
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,140
Growing up isn't enough.

637
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,140
You also need

638
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,820
a capable husband like Jianguo.

639
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,980
You sweet talker.

640
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,900
Jiali,

641
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,860
now that you have this house,

642
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,540
does that mean
you're officially moving out?

643
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,540
What? You don't want me to go?

644
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,780
You'll leave one day.

645
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,340
Without you, our home feels

646
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,020
like it's lost its backbone.

647
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,700
I'll come back every week.

648
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,580
This is great.

649
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,340
Look, all this furniture
was issued by the army.

650
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,540
It's really nice.

651
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,020
I can rest easy now.

652
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,180
Don't worry.

653
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,340
I won't wear this anymore.
You can have it.

654
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,340
It's too flashy.

655
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
You look good in it.

656
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,420
(Happiness)

657
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,940
Jiali,

658
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,980
these sheets are for you.

659
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,740
They're too many for me.

660
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,940
- Keep some.
- No need.

661
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,980
They'll all get some.

662
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,460
These are yours.

663
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
Remember.

664
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,340
Take them out to air on sunny days.

665
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,020
Don't forget mothballs.

666
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,340
Jiali,

667
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,940
you're really leaving?

668
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,580
They've gotten the certificate.

669
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,940
Your sister is married.

670
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,300
She's moving in

671
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,900
to start a new life with Jianguo.

672
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,140
Otherwise, Jianguo will be mad.

673
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,860
And how will they have children?

674
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,700
Mom!

675
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,400
- This is nice.
- Great.

676
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,700
- Move.
- Yes.

677
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,620
Take it slow.

678
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,580
- Careful.
- Jiali.

679
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,600
When can we eat

680
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,100
- I'll get it.
- your wedding candy?

681
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,980
- OK.
- At the wedding banquet.

682
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,620
Can we eat it now?

683
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,820
I can eat so much.

684
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,660
You can eat as much as you want.

685
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
The bride is coming out.

686
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,620
She's here.

687
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,540
The bride is here.

688
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,480
I want to go to the banquet with Jiali.

689
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,060
Mom, Dad, I'm going now.

690
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,660
Jiawen, take care of your sister.

691
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,500
Good.

692
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,380
Bye.

693
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,580
I'll be back on Sunday.

694
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,980
Jiali! Jiali!

695
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,510
Goodbye!

696
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,100
Wow, what a grand scene.

697
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,020
Soldiers really are impressive.

698
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,040
Being a soldier is amazing.

699
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
He, you're amazing.

700
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,060
Incredible!

701
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,180
This is a blessing!

702
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,020
You're blessed!

703
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,380
You're blessed!

704
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,340
(Happiness)

705
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,020
Today marks

706
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,900
a new beginning for this family.

707
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,540
Take a seat.

708
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,980
Jianguo, let me toast to you.

709
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,020
This is our own home.

710
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
How nice.

711
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,980
- Jianguo.
- Jiali.

712
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,860
You made this happen today.
You go first.

713
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,940
Jiali,

714
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,420
thank you for giving me a home.

715
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,740
From now on,

716
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,820
I finally have a family.

717
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,420
I just want you to know

718
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,020
that whether it's our little home

719
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,900
or the home with Mom, Dad, and sisters,

720
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,860
everything at home is my responsibility.

721
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,320
You're the eldest daughter.

722
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,780
I'm your husband.

723
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm ready to take on the challenge.

724
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,420
I promise to fulfill my duties.

725
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,980
You sound like you're giving a report.

726
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,420
Jianguo, I believe in you.

727
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,960
I just want

728
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,700
to build a good life with you.

729
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,000
We will.

730
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,620
Tell me. How good will it be?

731
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,660
Mom and Dad worked hard
to raise this family.

732
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,380
I want to do something for them first

733
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,060
and fulfill a wish of theirs.

734
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,460
What wish?

735
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
Well.

736
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,420
You'll find out soon.

737
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,060
Here.

738
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,700
(Happiness)

739
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,020
Jiali's bed goes to Jiawen.

740
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,620
That's not fair.

741
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
We younger ones are always last,

742
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,500
always getting hand-me-downs.

743
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,020
Clothes, shoes, school bags, textbooks,

744
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,120
and now even the bed!

745
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,290
- Yeah.
- Exactly!

746
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,380
We're all daughters.

747
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,140
Why can't things be divided equally?

748
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,660
First come, first served.
That's the rule.

749
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,580
There's no such thing
as absolute fairness.

750
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,420
Got it?

751
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,420
That's not right.

752
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,940
Jiali's bed should belong to all of us.

753
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,300
I want to sleep in Jiali's bed.

754
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,380
Me too.

755
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,500
Jiahuan, sit down.

756
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,520
How about this?

757
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,300
We take turns sleeping in Jiali's bed,

758
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,100
just like school duty shifts.

759
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,460
Jiaxi can sleep
with Mom and Dad for now.

760
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,980
The rest of us will take turns.

761
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,540
Three months each.

762
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,340
You guys pick your months first.

763
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,400
I'll take whatever is left.

764
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,100
Look.

765
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,800
Look how generous Jiawen is.

766
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,980
Why can't you all

767
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,700
learn from her?

768
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,580
Our cafeteria has been rented out

769
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,780
for wedding banquets
for these past few years.

770
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,160
Just last month,

771
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,500
your mom and I ate at one there.

772
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,580
- Not bad, right?
- It's great.

773
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,380
The food is great,

774
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
the place is big,

775
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,700
(Happy)
and everything's clean.

776
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Plus, the foreign trade company

777
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,100
subsidizes the cafeteria,

778
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,700
so they accept fewer food coupons.

779
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,060
(Happy Marriage)
They have their own supply of meat.

780
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,060
So we were wondering

781
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,180
if you could hold your wedding

782
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,340
at the cafeteria.

783
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,780
You two decide.

784
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,660
- Sure.
- You decide.

785
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,540
Just don't go overboard.

786
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,300
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

787
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,340
It has to be grand.

788
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,540
Mrs. Tang.

789
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,260
Mr. Tang.

790
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,180
Meixin.

791
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,060
What a coincidence.

792
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,580
I was just about to look for you.

793
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,540
What's wrong?

794
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,420
You go first.

795
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,780
Jiali and Jianguo are holding a banquet.

796
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,900
January 10th at the cafeteria
of the Foreign Trade Bureau.

797
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,140
Mr. Tang, here's your invitation.

798
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,980
(Wedding Invitation)

799
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,900
Tang,

800
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
we got one too.

801
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,340
Go get it.

802
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,140
Meixin, what are the odds?

803
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,540
Weimin and Qiufang's wedding

804
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,980
is also on that day

805
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,900
at the same cafeteria.

806
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,060
Our families are having a joint wedding.

807
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,020
Here.

808
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,300
What a coincidence.

810
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,700
It's on the same day.

811
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,320
(Wedding Invitation)
It's true.

812
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,340
That day is going to be lively.

813
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,990
Lively indeed.

814
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,900
Lively indeed.

815
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,740
Take care.

816
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,500
Still looking at her?

817
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,540
Oh, right.

818
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,940
She's left.

819
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,300
Then why are you still looking?

820
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,540
I was seeing her off.

821
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,340
On the same day at the same cafeteria.

822
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,380
They're obviously targeting us.

823
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,260
Think about it.

824
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,500
Should we

825
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,340
change the date?

826
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,980
Or the venue?

827
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,380
Why should we?

828
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,700
Just because their son
is getting married,

829
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,860
does it mean we have to change

830
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,900
our date and place?

831
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,100
There's limited space in that cafeteria,

832
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,740
and we're inviting so many people.

833
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,660
We invited them,

834
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,900
but they invited them too.

835
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,660
So, are they coming

836
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,900
to eat at our wedding

837
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,180
or theirs?

838
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,780
Don't worry about that.

839
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,940
Once the invitations are out,

840
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,860
guests can decide

841
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,300
for themselves.

842
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,190
They can eat

843
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,380
wherever they want.

844
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,340
It's not our concern.

845
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,300
But it's my first daughter's wedding.

846
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,660
Mom, is this color too bright?

847
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,700
Too bright? Not at all.

848
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,460
This red is perfect.

849
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,340
It's steady and dignified.

850
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,860
It's perfect for you.

851
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,460
Well.

852
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,900
This part isn't fitting well.

853
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,260
I'll ask them to adjust it.

854
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,300
No need.

855
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,380
The waist fits just right.

856
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,300
It'll be too tight.

857
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,060
That's the point.

858
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,540
It's time to show off your figure.

859
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,500
Exactly.

860
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,380
You need to look your best.

861
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,050
No need to compete with clothes.

862
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,260

than Qiufang.

Yes.
