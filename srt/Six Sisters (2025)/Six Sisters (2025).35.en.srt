I've got a cold.

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,590
Mom.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,880
What happened?

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,920
What's wrong?

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,640
Dad.

21
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,480
Don't cry.

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,720
What's wrong?

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,430
What happened?

24
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,840
Xiaonian, what did you do to her?

25
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,400
Dad, he didn't do anything to me.

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
He...

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
What have you done?

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,320
Mom,

29
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
can I

30
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,680
borrow some money?

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,550
What?

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,760
Money?

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,120
Why are you borrowing money?

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
It's urgent. I'll pay you back next month.

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,550
How much?

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,230
300,000 yuan.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,640
- Three...
- What?

38
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,200
Have you been robbed?

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,600
Say something!

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,990
I'm deep in debt.

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,470
I saw Aunt Jiahuan

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,950
making money in the stock market,

43
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,360
so I was tempted to try it.

44
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,510
They said I could make more in futures.

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,950
I never thought

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,160
that I was unlucky.

47
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,270
Futures?

48
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,280
Your aunt is professional in stock trading.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,630
Do you know anything about it?

50
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,710
No, I don't know.

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,840
But I wanted to give myself one more option.

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,870
If I hadn't been stuck with my job,

53
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,120
I could have gone into business,

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,870
and gone to Shanghai or Nanjing,

55
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,310
other than staying in Huainan,

56
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,800
watching others come back from abroad

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,960
and some of them becoming big shots.

58
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,110
Since her youth, Aunt Xiaoling has also

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,320
been venturing from place to place.

60
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,360
But I'm like a frog at the bottom of a well.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,600
You're out of your mind!

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,150
You think business is easy?

63
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,710
You only saw Jiahuan making money,

64
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,950
but you didn't see Xiaoling being bullied

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,790
or Jiayi and Jiaxi suffering huge losses.

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,030
You've got such a good job.

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,470
Everyone envies you,

68
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,550
but you hate it.

69
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,470
Mom, stop blaming me.

70
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,320
If I don't pay them back,

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,750
they will make a scene at my workplace.

72
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,360
The debt increases with compound interest.

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,990
Compound interest?

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,320
You owe a loan shark?

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,440
Is it a loan shark?

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,160
You jerk!

77
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,760
Dad!

78
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,550
Are you tired of the good life

79
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,390
and digging your own grave?

80
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,870
You don't know anything.

81
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,560
Why did you speculate on futures?

82
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,560
You're blinded by money and profit!

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,950
Dad, Mom,

84
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,120
don't be angry.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,430
If we can't pay back the money...

86
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,560
How can we pay it back?

87
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,200
How?

88
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,720
Now you remember your parents!

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,070
Borrowed money from a loan shark?

90
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,710
Are you trying to piss us off?

91
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,320
Get out!

92
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,590
Get out of here!

93
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,350
I'll pretend I don't have a son!

94
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,900
(Yibao Hotel)

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,910
Ouyang,

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,510
where is Jiayi?

97
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,390
Jiali.

98
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,510
Jiayi,

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,870
do you have any cash on hand?

100
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,350
If you do, lend me some.

101
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,510
Coming.

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,800
Jiahuan.

103
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,510
What's up?

104
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,150
Do you have any cash?

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,000
What's wrong?

106
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,760
Jiawen.

107
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,870
Don't worry.

108
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll go get the money

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,510
and bring it to you this afternoon.

110
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,390
Ok.

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,630
Jiali, here's the money.

112
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,410
I don't need it urgently,

113
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,600
and there's no rush for you to repay it.

114
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
You keep it.

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,760
You'll face a lot of expenses in the future.

116
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,940
Take it.

117
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,950
We're sisters. Don't stand on ceremony.

118
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,950
Besides, I don't need it recently.

119
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,560
This is the hardest time for you.

120
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,950
Thank you, Xiaoling.

121
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,000
Your words

122
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,030
make our sister bond meaningful.

123
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,710
Luckily, we took the initiative

124
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,950
and drove the couple out.

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,360
Otherwise, the debt collectors

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,630
would have shown up at our door.

127
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,000
How are we going to get by?

128
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,200
How could Xiaonian do that?

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,200
He was such a sweet boy.

130
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,120
Poor upbringing is a father's failing.

131
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,480
Xiaonian's life was too smooth.

132
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,640
He's carried away and has lost his marbles.

133
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,760
Futures speculation?

134
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,150
Unbelievable.

135
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,430
What's futures speculation?

136
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,590
Futures speculation...

137
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't know much about it.

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,030
Anyway, he owes a lot of money.

139
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,480
How much does he owe?

140
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,440
I don't know.

141
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,590
Constant saving leads to a financial hole.

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
She's been stingy in vain.

143
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Someone has spent all her money.

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
Her son is being self-destructive.

145
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,320
There's nothing she can do.

146
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,020
(Kill)

147
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,860
(He Xiangdong, Pay your debts)

148
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,340
(Kill, He Xiangdong, Pay your debts)

149
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,150
Where is Xiaonian?

150
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,320
He...

151
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,350
He ran away.

152
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,950
Let him pay the price for his misdeeds!

153
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,760
They spray-painted our door.

154
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,510
Open the door!

155
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,350
Open it!

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Open up!

157
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,590
Mom, they...

158
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,680
No, no, you stay here.

159
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,640
I'll get it.

160
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,510
I'm a woman.

161
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,030
They can't do anything to me.

162
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,440
Don't be afraid. It's a society ruled by law.

163
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,350
Jiali.

164
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,000
What brings you here?

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,950
I'm looking for He Xiangdong.

166
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,870
This is his house, right?

167
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,000
You're mistaken.

168
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,800
No way.

169
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,760
I'm telling you,

170
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,350
your son owes us money.

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,100
It's his obligation to pay his debts.

172
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,440
If the son runs away, the father has to pay.

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,910
Listen. Unless you give the money back,

174
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,160
we're not leaving today.

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
How much does he owe you?

176
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Three hundred thousand.

177
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,830
You leave first.

178
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,750
We'll figure it out.

179
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,750
Fine.

180
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,110
Let's go.

181
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,590
I'm telling you,

182
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,950
I won't be so polite next time I come.

183
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,440
He has to run.

184
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,110
Cut everyone off.

185
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Go

186
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,440
as far away as he can.

187
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,710
Geckos in danger break their tails to escape.

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,750
Wenwen,

189
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,400
he's in trouble, but you can't be.

190
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,040
Sell your apartment

191
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,520
and pay them back as much as you can.

192
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,230
He already ran away.

193
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,160
Do I have to sell the apartment?

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,350
Those wolves

195
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,440
won't stop until they get something.

196
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,040
Once it's sold, they'll have nothing to claim

197
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,750
with your assets dried up.

198
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,160
Dad, Mom,

199
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,630
I'm going to take Yiyi away.

200
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,820
(Huainan Station)

201
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,750
Mom,

202
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,350
my comrade's relative is hiring in Shanghai.

203
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,040
Stay safe when you're out there.

204
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,750
Call me when you arrive in Shanghai.

205
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,230
You're on your own.

206
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,680
You and Dad

207
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,510
take care of yourselves.

208
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,750
Stay well.

209
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,990
Don't worry about me.

210
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,440
There.

211
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,800
There, there.

212
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,630
What kind of mess is this?

213
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,440
He took the money

214
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,160
but failed to enlist him!

215
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,710
Can you believe this?

216
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,960
You know what, your nephew

217
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,480
is quite a character.

218
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,690
He's committing fraud!

219
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,630
Mom, Mom.

220
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm telling you,

221
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,390
Jiaxi,

222
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,630
you must take full responsibility for this.

223
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,400
Mom, don't worry.

224
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,110
I'm sure we can find a way to fix this,

225
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,520
right?

226
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,830
Not at all!

227
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,800
He already ran away!

228
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
Turns out my money

229
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,080
was just his travel allowance

230
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
and a bailout for his debts!

231
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,550
No, no way.

232
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,910
I'm sure

233
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,160
we'll get the money back.

234
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,630
Jiaxi,

235
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,440
the son ran away, right?

236
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,920
But he has parents.

237
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,360
Go to your sister.

238
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Tell her

239
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,440
to fix this

240
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
for me.

241
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
She has to fix this!

242
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,720
Your son took the money but did nothing.

243
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,710
Shouldn't you return it to me?

244
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,470
That's it, huh?

245
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,950
Jiali,

246
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,680
this is Jiaxi.

247
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,680
Jiaxi.

248
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,270
We heard

249
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,710
about Xiaonian.

250
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,480
I have something to tell you.

251
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,470
I'm listening.

252
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,750
Here's what happened.

253
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,150
A while ago,

254
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,830
I met Xiaonian

255
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,510
about getting

256
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,160
Hongyu's nephew enlisted in the military.

257
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,630
He took 20,000 yuan from me

258
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,320
but never got it done.

259
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,840
Now he's run away.

260
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,750
Can I get my money back?

261
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
I don't know anything about this.

262
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,080
Yes, but now you know.

263
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,350
You've heard it.

264
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,990
He ran away. I can't get in touch with him.

265
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,080
Jiali, Xiaonian

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,440
took money from us.

267
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
He's your son.

268
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,750
Shouldn't you pay me back?

269
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,030
This wasn't my idea,

270
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,710
and I knew nothing about it.

271
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,750
You two made your own deal.

272
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,560
Nobody forced either of you.

273
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,360
If you think he owes you,

274
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,990
go to him.

275
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,590
Jiali,

276
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,630
you can't act so shamelessly!

277
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,040
Jia...

278
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,240
Put this inside.

279
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,160
Ok.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,870
Be careful with this.

281
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,550
Just put it in the corner.

282
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,750
Jiali, Jianguo.

283
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,470
Did you really

284
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,230
sell Xiaonian's apartment?

285
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,950
Yes.

286
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,670
I used part of it to repay the loan sharks.

287
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,350
I borrowed money from Jiayi and Jiahuan.

288
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,520
Would you take my payment to them today?

289
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,750
Ok.

290
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,110
So,

291
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,950
where is Xiaonian?

292
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,590
He left.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,950
And Li Wen?

294
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,470
They are divorced.

295
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,200
And their daughter?

296
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,710
Where do you want me to put this photo?

297
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,710
Go inside and find a corner.

298
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,950
Ok.

299
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,910
Place the photo back side out.

300
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,800
Ok.

301
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,830
Peanuts, melon seeds, all kinds of snacks.

302
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
Don't get your hands hurt.

303
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,990
Ok.

304
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,320
Let's have a few drinks tonight.

305
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,160
Did he pass the exam?

306
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,630
He hasn't taken it yet.

307
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,040
Is it Guangming?

308
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,870
You stay here.

309
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,630
You're in the middle of it. I'll get it.

310
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,630
Coming.

311
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,990
Is it Guangming?

312
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,670
- Uncle.
- You're back. Come in.

313
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,590
Come on in.

314
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,870
Your mom is preparing crabs.

315
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,830
Go say hi.

316
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
Mom.

317
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,990
You're back.

318
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,440
How many days will you stay?

319
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,350
I'll leave the day after tomorrow.

320
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,280
So soon?

321
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,680
Then,

322
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,280
will you come back for the holiday?

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,710
I have to finish my exam first.

324
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,300
Ok.

325
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,960
Good, at least you will come back.

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,110
This is your grandma.

327
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,680
Do you remember her?

328
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,560
Yes, a little bit.

329
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,000
You were only two when she died.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,990
How can you remember her?

331
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,830
I remember when you were born,

332
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,830
she was so thrilled.

333
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,310
Dad told me my grandma

334
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,940
was from Shouxian.

335
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,040
A big family from Shouxian.

336
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,480
People lining up to propose to her

337
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,000
could fill an entire street.

338
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,670
But she was only interested in your grandpa.

339
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,800
Your grandma

340
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,040
was sweet

341
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and sharp.

342
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,920
When she was alive,

343
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,110
your uncle and aunts...

344
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,910
Forget about it. Let bygones be bygones.

345
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,280
Anyway, remember

346
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,520
that she thought the most of you.

347
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,100
(Yibao Hotel)

348
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,240
I hear

349
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,590
the old house in Longhu

350
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,590
will be demolished.

351
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,960
Really?

352
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,800
The authority has started mobilization.

353
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,480
Mom didn't tell me.

354
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,960
She wouldn't tell us.

355
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
It belongs to everyone of us.

356
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Why didn't she tell us?

357
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,560
That's true,

358
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,310
but don't you know who she has favored?

359
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,400
Jiali was kicked out.

360
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,390
Why?

361
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,190
We must ask Mom about this.

362
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,510
Don't. It will only make you upset.

363
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,870
I'm not asking her just to get the house.

364
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,830
I want an explanation.

365
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,240
- Jiahuan.
- You...

366
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,430
You're leaving?

367
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,800
Well,

368
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,320
what's wrong with her again?

369
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,000
I said the wrong thing.

370
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,350
Now there's going to be some drama.

371
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,720
How could a wrong word start drama?

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,840
Tell me.

373
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,870
Aren't you going to tell me?

374
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,870
Mom.

375
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,590
Jiahuan.

376
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,110
Where is Mom?

377
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,960
At the tailor's to get her pants hemmed.

378
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,670
Have a seat.

379
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,040
Come.

380
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,560
When did you replace it?

381
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,190
Not long ago.

382
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,270
You're just in time.

383
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,350
Sit down and feel the new couch.

384
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,670
It's good. Sit.

385
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,240
How are you doing, Jiahuan?

386
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,240
Jiaxi, is this area going to be demolished?

387
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,160
That's true.

388
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
I was going to tell you and Jiayi.

389
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,560
Will we get the flats or money?

390
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,080
I don't know.

391
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,520
We have to wait for the policy.

392
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm not here to ask for money or a house.

393
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,110
This is our house.

394
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,200
Shouldn't we clarify how it'll be assigned?

395
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,830
We should, of course.

396
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,590
But the problem is

397
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,520
we're not sure about the compensation.

398
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,080
The house is still Mom's.

399
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,160
It's up to Mom

400
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,630
who she wants to give it to.

401
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,520
She can give it to whoever is filial.

402
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,920
Did Jiali send you?

403
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,400
What does it have to do with her?

404
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,440
Look.

405
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
It must be her.

406
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,280
I can tell from your denial.

407
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,590
Jiahuan, I'm telling you,

408
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,960
He Jiali

409
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,350
is trying to divide us,

410
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,000
and using you as a pawn.

411
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,110
Jiahuan, think about it.

412
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,630
Search your conscience and think.

413
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,190
Haven't I been good to you?

414
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,720
When you got out

415
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,910
and were at your worst, who helped you?

416
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,960
And Hongyu

417
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,280
had been running around helping Fang Tao.

418
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,000
Alright, Jiahuan,

419
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,720
I'll tell you the truth today.

420
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,880
If Mom doesn't give me the house,

421
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,390
I won't complain.

422
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,590
But if Mom gives it to me,

423
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,280
you will definitely get a share.

424
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,320
Really?

425
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,400
My dear Jiahuan,

426
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,520
why don't you understand?

427
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,830
We're in the same boat.

428
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,390
Think about it.

429
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,280
He Jiali bought a house.

430
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
What does that mean?

431
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
How much money do you think she has?

432
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,790
I think she's like

433
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,520
He Shen, that corrupt official.

434
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,240
She's embezzled all our money.

435
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,830
As the old saying goes,

436
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,750
"several years as governor,

437
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,960
a fortune in silver,"

438
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,800
not to mention she's been in charge

439
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,280
and bullied us for years.

440
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Jiahuan, we have to wake up and fight back.

441
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,590
That's weird.

442
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,190
What's wrong?

443
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,910
She left in a huff, right?

444
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,040
However, after visiting the house,

445
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,030
she said that the demolition

446
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,430
should be left to take its natural course.

447
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,630
Isn't that good?

448
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,830
You don't have to worry about it.

449
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,080
That's true.

450
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I shouldn't have told her.

451
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,870
Yeah, isn't it good?

452
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,910
Most likely, Jiahuan

453
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,190
has been won over by Jiaxi.

454
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,910
You think so?

455
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
I should go back home

456
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,840
and take a look.

457
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,040
Hello, Jiayi.

458
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,630
Jiaxi, are you rich?

459
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,190
You've replaced the furniture.

460
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,590
Look at the red couch.

461
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm not rich.

462
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,240
I just had to replace it.

463
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,870
The old couch was a mess.

464
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,560
It wasn't good for Mom's back.

465
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,910
I paid for the new couch myself.

466
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,190
Do you know this area will be demolished?

467
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,310
I heard a bit about it,

468
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,240
but I didn't ask.

469
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,280
Jiaxi,

470
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,040
I must warn you in advance.

471
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,480
You can't

472
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,910
hog the house all by yourself.

473
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't get it.

474
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,870
Mom asked you to take care of her.

475
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,480
It's like making you her heir.

476
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,520
However,

477
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,670
if you try to hog it all by yourself,

478
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,190
I'll see you in court.

479
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,800
Are you going to sue Mom?

480
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,670
I'll side with justice rather than family.

481
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,240
Jiayi,

482
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,240
let me tell you this.

483
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,190
If that day ever comes

484
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,110
when I get a share,

485
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,830
you will as well,

486
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,110
but it applies only to Jiahuan, you, and me,

487
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,240
the three of us.

488
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,000
We must be united.

489
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,480
What about Xiaoling?

490
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,430
She's been expelled as a permanent member.

491
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,590
Are the debt collectors still coming?

492
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,560
Once in a while on holidays.

493
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,000
The principal's almost paid off. Let it be.

494
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,670
They can't do anything to me or Jianguo.

495
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,510
I don't care and can't do anything.

496
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,350
Jiali, Jiawen.

497
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,000
- Hello.
- Xiaoling.

498
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,150
Peeling garlic?

499
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,110
What have you been up to lately?

500
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,870
Doing business in Nanjing.

501
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm here today

502
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,830
to tell you something.

503
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,040
What is it?

504
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,280
I have a boyfriend.

505
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,970
Who?

506
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,910
A guy.

507
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,150
Who is the guy?

508
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,800
Come on in.

509
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,520
This is my boyfriend, He.

510
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,260
(Gift Box, Huainan Specialties)

511
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,140
(Peanut Oil)

512
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,190
He, have some water. Help yourself.

513
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,870
Drink water.

514
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,630
He,

515
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,040
how did you meet Xiaoling?

516
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,000
We met on the train.

517
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,800
Fate.

518
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,630
Fate brought us together.

519
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
That's true.

520
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,920
He, what do you do for a living?

521
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,110
Why do you have to travel all the time?

522
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,350
I'm in the building materials business

523
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,000
in Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing.

524
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,630
Recently, I've been working in Anhui.

525
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,550
Where are you from?

526
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,160
Jiangdu, Yangzhou.

527
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,320
- That's our hometown.
- Yes.

528
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,670
Your surname is also He.

529
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,630
What a coincidence.

530
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,430
Who are your family members?

531
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,110
There's no one left in my family.

532
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,630
My parents passed away early.

533
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,480
I have an elder sister,

534
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,630
but she got married.

535
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,190
We don't keep in touch much.

536
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,640
Have you been married?

537
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,310
No, never.

538
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,720
Why not?

539
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,480
I haven't found the right woman.

540
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,110
Do you know Xiaoling well?

541
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,240
Yes, he knows everything about me.

542
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,280
Xiaoling,

543
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,430
let him talk.

544
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,190
Go ahead.

545
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,750
I know, Jiali.

546
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,240
Xiaoling told me everything.

547
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,430
I can accept it.

548
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,390
Marriage is a big deal. Do think it over.

549
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,630
Xiaoling can't afford

550
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,830
to mess up again.

551
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,830
If you're really getting married,

552
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,320
make it a forever thing.

553
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,630
That's what I think.

554
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,040
Have you visited Mom?

555
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,630
Not yet.

556
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,630
Don't hide a big deal like this from Mom.

557
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,720
There's something strange about it.

558
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,280
How come?

559
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,350
He's a really nice guy.

560
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,590
And he's never married.

561
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,160
He’s decent-looking.

562
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,520
What does he like in Xiaoling?

563
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,310
Xiaoling's always been popular with men.

564
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,910
I think it makes sense.

565
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,720
He can't have a serious problem, huh?

566
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,270
You mean health issues...

567
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,390
Or shady morals.

568
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,870
That's easy.

569
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,030
Didn't he say he is from Jiangdu?

570
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,000
Why don't we ask our aunt's son

571
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,030
to dig into this?

572
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,350
Then we'll get answers.

573
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,240
That's right.

574
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,080
We need to find out.

575
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,280
Mom, I'm back.

576
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,800
Come on in.

577
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,240
Mopping the floor, huh?

578
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,670
This is...

579
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,040
Let me introduce you.

580
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,830
This is my boyfriend, He.

581
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,910
I'm He Qiqing. Nice to meet you.

582
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,030
This is He...

583
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,670
He Qiqing.

584
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,000
How do you do?

585
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,480
Boyfriend.

586
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,960
Hello.

587
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,240
Her sixth sister.

588
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,430
Hello.

589
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,240
Come on in.

590
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,110
Come in, He.

591
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,160
Go ahead.

592
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,030
Don't stand on ceremony.

593
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,080
Make yourself at home.

594
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,870
Here are some gifts as a token of my respect.

595
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,160
You're too kind.

596
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,920
Sit here. Get him a glass of water.

597
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,830
- Yes.
- Or tea.

598
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,590
I'm sorry. Sit down, He.

599
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,320
Where are you from, He?

600
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,440
Mrs. He,

601
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
I'm from your hometown,

602
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,430
Jiangdu.

603
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,630
Really? What a coincidence!

604
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,110
Where did you meet?

605
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,390
She didn't tell us.

606
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,000
We met on the train.

607
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,750
On the train?

608
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,790
Mom, I brought him to meet you

609
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,430
to finalize our marriage.

610
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,560
I only wish you'll be happy.

611
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
That's great.

612
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,640
Congratulations, He!

613
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,590
Thanks.

614
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,280
You're from our hometown.

615
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,550
You know the customs there.

616
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,830
There has to be a bride price.

617
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,870
Yes, I know the customs.

618
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,590
Let's follow them.

619
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,240
Mrs. He, let's follow the customs.

620
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,390
Well...

621
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,630
He, you don't know.

622
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,030
Let me tell you,

623
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,070
you have no idea how hard it was for Mom

624
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,280
to bring up Xiaoling.

625
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,070
And of the six girls,

626
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,550
only she took Mom's last name,

627
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,440
Liu.

628
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,280
She's her rightful heir.

629
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
You have to pay

630
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,480
double the bride price.

631
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,000
Double, ok.

632
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
No problem.

633
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,320
Mrs. He, double.

634
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,320
- Well...
- Don't be ridiculous.

635
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,910
Double.

636
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,790
Jiali, do you think we're mistaken?

637
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,920
He doesn't

638
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,800
look like a murderer to me.

639
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,830
Do you think criminals come with a label?

640
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,040
Who is it?

641
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,670
Coming.

642
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Jiali, Jiawen?

643
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,110
Is He home?

644
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,830
He's out.

645
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,240
Do you know who He Qiqing is?

646
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,190
He's a murderer who has done time.

647
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,670
I know.

648
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,670
And you still want to marry him?

649
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,590
How could you sleep at night

650
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,670
with such a guy lying next to you?

651
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Xiaoling, this isn't a joke.

652
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,350
He killed someone.

653
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,910
Can you imagine how brutal he is?

654
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,630
Jiawen, Jiali,

655
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,750
it's not what you think.

656
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,750
It was an accident.

657
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,750
If it was on purpose, how could he get out?

658
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,040
Still, he is a murderer.

659
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,790
You were headstrong before.

660
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,670
You got divorced when you were unhappy.

661
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,960
But with someone like him,

662
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,160
if you can't make it work

663
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,670
and decide to divorce him, he'd probably...

664
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,110
Jiali, Jiali,

665
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,960
calm down.

666
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,160
When the time comes, we can't help you.

667
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,510
Jiali, don't worry.

668
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,440
He isn't that kind of guy.

669
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,550
I know him well.

670
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,590
I'm telling you, Liu Xiaoling,

671
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,750
Jiali is doing this for your own good.

672
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,310
This isn't your first or second marriage.

673
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,550
If you marry again,

674
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,720
shouldn't you make it last a lifetime?

675
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,790
Yes.

676
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,550
I think there is no rush.

677
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,790
Let's watch and examine him

678
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,960
more carefully.

679
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,350
Think it over before any decision, ok?

680
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,200
I know.

681
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,280
I will think it over.

682
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,080
Xiaoling,

683
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,280
since your sisters don't agree,

684
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,880
why don't we...

685
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,590
We what? Say goodbye?

686
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,520
Break up? That's crazy.

687
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,040
I think Jiali is right.

688
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,550
Maybe I'm cursed to bring bad luck.

689
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,200
Why else

690
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,910
would that foreman die

691
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,580
when I shoved him years ago?

692
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,800
Let's not talk about this.

693
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,800
I'm afraid that if we get married,

694
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,550
I'll bring bad luck to you.

695
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,430
Why are you so superstitious?

696
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,960
If that's the case, I'm cursed too.

697
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,830
My ex-ex-husband died.

698
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,200
If we get married,

699
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,830
I'll be the one bringing bad luck to you.

700
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,430
He.

701
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,110
I'm just asking you,

702
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,240
do you love me?

703
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,280
Yes.

704
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,550
Do you want to marry me?

705
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,480
Yes.

706
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,870
That's it.

707
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,280
Two bruised souls grown from the same vine,

708
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,240
we are survivors soaked in sorrow.

709
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,750
From now on, let's just

710
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,910
cherish each other,

711
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,590
and make our marriage last a lifetime. Deal?

712
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,410
Deal.

713
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,800
Xiaoling,

714
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,520
how much shall I give for the bride price?

715
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,910
Not a penny.

716
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,110
Seriously? Is it appropriate?

717
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,000
Sure.

718
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,910
As the old saying goes,

719
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,590
an inch of flexibility gains a year of life.

720
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,480
- Stretch daily to thrive.
- Is that so?

721
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,750
I stretch my legs like this every day.

722
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,480
I'm getting old. I can't do this anymore.

723
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,630
No.

724
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,240
We're still young.

725
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,720
Don't let time beat you.

726
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,390
What's wrong?

727
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,420
(Huainan No.1 People's Hospital, Outpatient)

728
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,000
Mom,

729
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,440
you're impossible.

730
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
How old are you even?

731
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,920
How can you still act like a child,

732
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,040
stretching your legs at the park?

733
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,510
Hongyu and I

734
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,440
work our bones to dust every day.

735
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,710
Who has time to watch your every move

736
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,630
and cater to your every need?

737
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,590
Come on. Say no more.

738
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,840
It was just an accident.

739
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,440
I'll stop working for a couple of days.

740
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,630
I can take care of you.

741
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,230
Can you do it in a couple of days?

742
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,960
Look! Bone injuries take 100 days to heal.

743
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,630
She'll take a long time to recover.

744
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,590
Alright, come out.

745
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,590
I need to talk to you.

746
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,590
Mom, take a rest.

747
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,320
Won't your words

748
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,480
make her feel worse?

749
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,800
Who doesn't feel bad?

750
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,790
I?

751
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,040
That's my mom.

752
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,230
No, I have to call Jiayi and Jiahuan.

753
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,630
She isn't my liability alone.

754
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,080
How about this,

755
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,590
the three of us take turns,

756
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,110
each taking two-day shifts.

757
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,080
Mom needs round-the-clock care.

758
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,400
I can't leave my hotel unattended.

759
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,670
What do you think, Jiayi?

760
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,030
I think

761
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,840
Mom doesn't just belong to someone

762
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,400
or the three of us.

763
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,630
If we're doing this,

764
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,440
all of the six girls should take shifts.

765
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,440
No one gets to bail.

766
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,040
Then you tell Jiali.

767
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,040
Sure, I'll do it.

768
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,190
What if she asks about the house?

769
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,590
Doesn't she know about the demolition?

770
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,710
I don't know if she does.

771
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,590
She hasn't called to ask about it.

772
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,270
I guess she knows she is wrong.

773
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,960
Mom kicked Jiali out.

774
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,710
If the house is demolished in the future,

775
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,360
only we can get a share of the compensation.

776
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,210
So we are responsible

777
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,840
for taking care of Mom.

778
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,710
I don't think so.

779
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,560
These are separate issues.

780
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,270
The house is one issue,

781
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,520
and our duty for Mom is another.

782
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,190
Mom is in trouble now.

783
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,080
We have no reason to hide it from them.

784
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,110
Otherwise, even if we do our duty,

785
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,310
they may turn around and say,

786
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,110
"We'd have stepped up too,

787
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,920
if anyone told us

788
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,790
Mom was sick."

789
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,080
Jiayi is right.

790
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,760
We should tell Jiali, Jiawen,

791
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,150
and Xiaoling about this.

792
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,000
Xiaoling is getting married again,

793
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,270
with a vulgar rich guy.

794
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,510
Really?

795
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,270
She already brought him to Mom.

796
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,000
Don't change the subject.

797
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,920
Get to the point.

798
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,270
Who is going to tell Jiali and Jiawen?

799
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,360
Don't look at me.

800
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,710
Jiali keeps ignoring me.

801
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,520
Her son still owes me 20,000 yuan.

802
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,940
Alright.

803
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,710
I'll do it.

804
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,750
I'll tell them all

805
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,110
and get everyone together to discuss it.

806
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,400
Who was it?

807
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,270
Jiahuan.

808
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,000
She said Mom wants us to have a meeting.

809
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,080
Looks like she has come to her senses

810
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,000
and wants to patch things up.

811
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,310
It's hard to say.

812
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,590
When and where is the meeting?

813
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,630
I'll go with you.

814
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,590
Tomorrow. Not at home.

815
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,670
I'll go with Jiawen.

816
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,670
I was told no husbands.

817
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,560
Why?

818
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,510
Are they afraid I'll make a scene?

819
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,350
Afraid

820
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,750
and guilty.

821
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,310
That's why they don't have it at home.

822
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,710
If they did, any scene caused

823
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,400
would make us the neighbors' laughing stock.

824
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,740
(Yibao Hotel)

825
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,310
What's wrong with Mom's leg?

826
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,560
Tell us.

827
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,150
Today,

828
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,590
we're here to talk

829
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,960
about Mom's leg.

830
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,440
Let's not hold off for Xiaoling.

831
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,710
Start the meeting now.

832
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,590
Wait for her.

833
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,030
Six sisters.

834
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,590
No one should be left out.

835
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,590
Hello.

836
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,480
Everyone is here.

837
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,590
Alright, we are all here now.

838
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,150
Go ahead.

839
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,840
Mom,

840
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,150
go ahead.

841
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,590
I'm

842
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,270
getting older every day

843
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
and my health is failing.

844
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,000
My leg injury

845
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,710
has left me hobbling.

846
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,310
I have to go to the hospital constantly

847
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,080
for injections and medication.

848
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,790
Jiaxi pays for all the expenses

849
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,360
and takes care of me.

850
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,880
It's not fair that she has to

851
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,710
carry the entire burden by herself.

852
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,560
You're all my daughters, right?

853
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,110
It's time for you to come up

854
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,670
with a fair arrangement

855
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,000
for my long-term care.

856
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,070
Yes.

857
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
There's no need

858
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,750
for a rigid approach.

859
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,320
We each do our part

860
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,310
based on what we can offer.

861
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,080
Mom,

862
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,920
isn't your care arrangement

863
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
fair and clear?

864
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,360
It used to be Jiali's responsibility.

865
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,080
Now it's Jiaxi's.

866
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,840
Didn't Dad and Grandma make it clear?

867
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,110
Whoever lives in the house looks after Mom.

868
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,400
Jiawen, that's not fair.

869
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,840
Then what is fair?

870
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,440
Why do you live with Mom

871
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,400
instead of your mother-in-law?

872
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,790
I moved back for my daughter.

873
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,510
I see.

874
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,070
For your daughter.

875
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,960
You're not living there to look after Mom.

876
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,840
You only care about your daughter.

877
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,510
I didn't say I don't care about Mom.

878
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,710
I'm the only one looking after her lately.

879
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,790
But the problem is,

880
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,310
Mom isn't my responsibility alone.

881
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,480
We're all her daughters.

882
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,920
We should each do our part to care for her.

883
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,110
I think

884
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
now that Mom has brought it up,

885
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,150
we should work out a solution.

886
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,110
Jiahuan,

887
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,880
what do you think?

888
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,560
I think we should work this out together.

889
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,710
You've moved your registration back, right?

890
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,520
The six of us bear equal weight.

891
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,030
We agreed

892
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,110
that whoever occupies Mom's house

893
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,190
should provide for her.

894
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,230
Xiaoling, shut up.

895
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,840
You are in no position to say that.

896
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,630
You've been fooling around outside

897
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,400
and have never taken care of her.

898
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,230
You should contribute money and effort first.

899
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,150
Jiaxi,

900
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,110
no need to blow up.

901
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,710
Apples and oranges.

902
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,320
Taking care of Mom is our duty as sisters,

903
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,920
but first, we must clarify the house issue.

904
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,710
Anyway, we each do our part.

905
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,710
I'll make it clear today.

906
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,960
I don't want the house.

907
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,520
I'm not entitled to it.

908
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,230
It's your own business if you don't want it.

909
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
I'm telling you, I must get my share,

910
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,310
even if it's a bathroom.

911
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,030
When we get the house,

912
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,190
who gets it and how it should be split

913
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,880
is another matter.

914
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Affection is one thing,

915
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,190
and the law is another.

916
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,110
Don't mix it up.

917
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,640
Jiaxi,

918
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
tell us,

919
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,400
what's the situation with the house?

920
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,400
It's Mom's house. What can I say?

921
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,440
You should ask Mom.

922
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,590
It has nothing to do with me.

923
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,670
Jiaxi,

924
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,920
has Mom

925
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,190
transferred the house to you?

926
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,080
No.

927
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,150
No? If so,

928
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,560
bring out the house deed for everyone to see.

929
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,560
Yes.

930
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,960
Yes, show it to everyone.

931
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,030
Who would carry it around?

932
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,310
Then go home and get it.

933
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,920
Come on. I'll go with you.

934
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,710
Are you kidding? Let go!

935
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,520
I don't think that's necessary.

936
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,710
Mom, you tell them!

937
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,160
I guess the house

938
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,480
is no longer in Mom's name.

939
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,520
Jiaxi,

940
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,440
has Mom actually

941
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,560
transferred the house deed to you?
