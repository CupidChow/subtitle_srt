(September, 1996)

Xiaonian.

17
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,290
Say thank you to Dad.

18
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,980
You've finally got a job.

19
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,820
Thank you, Dad.

20
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,900
Don't thank me.

21
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,570
I didn't exactly help.

22
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,210
You made a good showing

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,740
with a third-class merit.

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,260
You're just qualified.

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,700
So, you're hired.

26
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,140
When you work,

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,850
people will respect you.

28
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,900
I get it, Mom. I'll work hard.

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,060
I'll serve the people

30
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,180
and won't disgrace you.

31
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,010
Have you washed your hands?

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,450
Yes, Mom. Let me have a bite.

33
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,650
It looks so tempting.

34
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,290
Xiaoling.

35
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,780
Xiaoling.

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,100
Why do we have much less income

37
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,370
than that of last month?

38
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,900
It's the off-season.

39
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,530
Something's wrong with the accounts.

40
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,810
Are you saying

41
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,530
Liu Xiaoling played a dirty trick?

42
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,900
I can't drink more.

43
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,220
- Xiaoling.
- Xiaoling, you lost.

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,430
- Drink.
- Come on, drink.

45
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,930
Drink, drink.

46
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,340
Drink, drink.

47
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,690
Let's drink together.

48
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,530
Ok.

49
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,580
Hello. Would you like more drinks?

50
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,810
We've had enough, Xiaoling, really.

51
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,060
Quite enough.

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,220
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,740
It's ok. One more box of beer.

54
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,890
Another snack-fruit tray.

55
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,820
- Xiaoling.
- It's enough.

56
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,690
Quite enough.

57
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,530
We've enjoyed a lot.

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,620
Don't be stingy when we have fun.

59
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,770
Money is nothing. Let's drink.

60
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,060
To Xiaoling. To Xiaoling.

61
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,970
Cheers.

62
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,690
Aren't we supposed to be profiting?

63
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,300
Why did we lose over 30,000?

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,540
It doesn't make sense.

65
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,380
Umm...

66
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,810
We've been profiting.
We couldn't have lost money.

67
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,250
Where's Liu Xiaoling?

68
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,020
Get her here.

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,930
She has to explain it.

70
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,420
She's been absent for days.

71
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,420
I'm also looking for her.

72
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,690
Oh no.

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,170
What's wrong?

74
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,020
How many days exactly?

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,300
Quite a few.

76
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,300
What's wrong?

77
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,580
One pair for each.

78
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,450
Here are eight pairs.

79
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,540
I nearly used up
my pay for the first month.

80
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,170
You're such a caring boy.

81
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,250
You only need to buy them
for Great-grandma and Grandma.

82
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,810
No way. I must treat you equally.

83
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,220
My aunts all care for me.

84
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,490
Good boy.

85
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,450
Yeah. He's sensible and generous.

86
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,420
You shouldn't have just bought shoes.

87
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,250
You could have bought pants or coats

88
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,340
from Aunt Xiaoling's store.

89
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,740
I went there,
only to be told she wasn't there.

90
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,930
She wasn't there?

91
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,740
Here. It's yours, Great-grandma.

92
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,370
Pretty shoes.

93
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,330
This pair is for Grandma.

94
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,920
Grandma, you often go
to the market for business

95
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,810
and you walk a lot.

96
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,690
So, I bought you sneakers.

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,780
- I...
- She doesn't like sneakers.

98
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,930
Are there leather shoes?

99
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,460
She is Aunt Xiaoling's size.

100
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,810
- Size 38.
- No need.

101
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,650
Yes, yes.

102
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,020
If I take them, what about Xiaoling?

103
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,300
She'll take sneakers. She loves them.

104
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,260
Mom,

105
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,660
you even get a present
from the fourth generation.

106
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,500
Yeah.

107
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,340
- Isn't it great?
- These shoes...

108
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,180
Grandma.

109
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,360
Aunt Xiaoling.

110
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,660
What's wrong? What's the rush?

111
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,540
Aunt Xiaoling, I got paid.

112
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,780
- I bought you sneakers.
- Why?

113
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,660
Want me to leave?

114
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,060
What are you talking about?

115
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,980
He means well. Come on.

116
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,810
- That's right.
- Fine. Thanks.

117
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,330
Who are you looking at?

118
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,860
Nobody.

119
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,980
Listen, Liu Xiaoling.

120
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,170
Even if you run away,

121
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,250
you can't always hide.

122
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,890
Give me back the money honestly.

123
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,250
Or I'll break your leg today.

124
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,010
Do you get it?

125
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,660
Don't go too far.

126
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,100
What's going on here?

127
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,610
I... I'm...

128
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,060
I'm being hunted.

129
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,450
Make it clear. What happened?

130
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,810
They insisted that I stole their money.

131
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,170
But that's the share I deserve.

132
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,020
They did nothing,

133
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,450
but took advantage of me together.

134
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,010
- Troublemaker.
- Open the door.

135
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,620
You...

136
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,660
Why did you mess

137
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,060
with this kind of guy?

138
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,020
He's Mi Lu's boyfriend.

139
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,660
They both took advantage of me.

140
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,300
Liu Xiaoling, come out here.

141
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,140
Jiali.

142
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,370
Save Xiaoling, please.

143
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,460
How much do you owe them?

144
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,340
Not even a penny.

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,370
Then why do they hunt you?

146
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,410
They think I stole money.

147
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,610
But they took their share.

148
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,370
What's the problem
with taking my own money?

149
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,300
How much did you take?

150
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,540
Thirty thousand.

151
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,380
Thirty...

152
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,980
- Where's the money?
- It's gone.

153
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,010
What do you mean?

154
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,540
I used it up.

155
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,810
What the heck, Liu Xiaoling?

156
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,650
Liu Xiaoling,

157
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,450
I'll count from three.

158
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,420
If you still don't come out,

159
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,070
I'll break more than your leg.

160
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,580
Mom, get into the room

161
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,420
with Grandma.

162
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,930
I'll think of a way.

163
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,250
- Can you?
- Are you sure?

164
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,520
- Xiaonian.
- Here.

165
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,480
Come on.

166
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,540
Look what you've done.

167
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,140
How could you spend so much money?

168
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,980
Three!

169
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,250
Or she wouldn't give us the money.

170
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,050
Liu Xiaoling, come out here

171
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,700
and explain everything.

172
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,540
Two!

173
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,220
I think you have to leave Huainan.

174
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,410
Yes. I... I'll leave.

175
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,540
I'll leave for another city.

176
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,050
- I'll go into business.
- Seriously?

177
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,540
You can't even get out of this house.

178
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,380
What do I do, then?

179
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,330
One!

180
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,810
Aunt Xiaoling, I'll cover you.
Let's rush out.

181
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,140
Ok. Let's fight them.

182
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,170
Ridiculous.

183
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,010
There are at least five of them.

184
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,170
Don't be silly.

185
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,140
- Be wise.
- Liu Xiaoling!

186
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,730
You're pushing me!

187
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,450
Liu Xiaoling, come out quickly!

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,860
Xiaonian. You go out
through the back door.

189
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,020
Make big noises.

190
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,220
- Ok.
-Lure them over.

191
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,540
Just don't let them catch you.

192
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,140
Get a chance to call your dad.

193
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,780
He'll go to the train station
with money and wait for us.

194
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,060
Ok. Let's go.

195
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,660
You don't come out, huh?

196
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,900
Smash.

197
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,260
A back door, huh?

198
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,580
Mi Lu, let's go get her.

199
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,420
There's a back door.

200
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,030
Mom.

201
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Lock the door.

202
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,250
If they break in
and see the two old ladies,

203
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,220
they won't hurt you.

204
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,450
Go. Hurry.

205
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,140
Be careful.

206
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,930
This is the only train.

207
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,260
I'll go wherever it takes me.

208
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,900
Jiali.

209
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,140
Jianguo.

210
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,660
Umm...

211
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,260
They aren't catching up, huh?

212
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Don't be scared. It's crowded here.

213
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,380
They won't do anything.

214
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,220
Right.

215
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,980
Take the money.

216
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
It's all we have. Spend it wisely.

217
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Take care of yourself
when you're out there.

218
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,620
Take it.

219
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,660
Call us if you need anything.

220
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,260
We'll handle everything here.

221
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,100
Don't worry.

222
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,460
Thanks, Jianguo.

223
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,900
Thanks, Jiali.

224
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,220
It's ok.

225
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,820
Will Yangyang come?

226
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,940
Yes, I think.

227
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,570
Dear passengers,

228
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,540
the train going to Xiamen

229
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,060
will leave soon.

230
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,260
If you haven't boarded,

231
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,130
get on the train soon.

232
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,200
Are you going to Xiamen?

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,040
Get on the train.

234
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,980
Go ahead.

235
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,780
Or the door will be closed.

236
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
Go.

237
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,900
I really have to go.

238
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,020
Go ahead.

239
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,940
Call us when you arrive.

240
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
Ok.

241
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,780
Stay safe when you're alone.

242
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,660
Call us when you arrive.

243
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,260
Jiali, I'll leave Yangyang to you.

244
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,140
Don't worry.

245
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,020
Stay safe when you're out there.

246
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,020
- Jiali!
- Jiali!

247
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,820
Where's she?

248
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,410
- Yangyang!
- Over there.

249
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,270
Xiaoling.

250
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,190
Liu Xiaoling!

251
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,060
Liu Xiaoling!

252
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,180
Mom has to leave.

253
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,660
Take good care of yourself.

254
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,180
Listen to Dad!

255
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,340
We rushed over, but still missed.

256
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,460
Yangyang!

257
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,620
I'll go after her.

258
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,460
Don't make trouble.

259
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,940
Your top priority

260
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,060
is to take care of Yangyang.

261
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,620
Where has Mom gone?

262
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,300
Mom.

263
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,420
Where's Liu Xiaoling?

264
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,060
You're in the wrong place.

265
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,140
Come on.

266
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,420
I can get here even with my eyes closed.

267
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,700
Who are you?

268
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,700
Are you Liu Xiaoling's mother?

269
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,620
Yes, I am. So what?

270
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,260
You look quite young.

271
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,420
Are you hiding her?

272
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,820
You've looked around, huh?

273
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
She isn't here.

274
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,580
It's ok.

275
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,580
Even if she isn't here,

276
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,380
her family members are.

277
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,620
We'll come tomorrow.

278
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,980
Bye.

279
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,580
"Mom".

280
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,620
Give me one.

281
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Tastes good.

282
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,980
What's Jiali doing?

283
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,100
Locking the door.

284
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Yan Hongyu,

285
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,180
I hear there are fortunes
all over the south.

286
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,430
When you bend...

287
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,580
You don't even need to bend.

288
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,980
Just stretch out your hands

289
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,740
and money will fly to them.

290
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,380
Who told you that?

291
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,800
I think Xiaoling

292
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,860
will profit by foul means.

293
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,540
Ordinary people like us

294
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,490
should work hard

295
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,020
and live a normal life.

296
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,420
We need to break out
of the comfort zone.

297
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,860
I have so many skills.

298
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,620
Why can't I use them?

299
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,900
Clean it. It's scratchy.

300
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,380
All day long,

301
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,220
I'm so bored at home.

302
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,620
Go away.

303
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,020
Don't touch me
after touching your feet.

304
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,860
- I...
- You...

305
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,260
Yan Hongyu, stop it.

306
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,420
Stop it.

307
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,580
Come on. Drink the milk.

308
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,780
No.

309
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,460
Did Xiaoling really run away?

310
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,380
Yes, she did.

311
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,900
Glad there are chances in the south.

312
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,940
But I fear she may go wrong

313
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,020
and make illegal money.

314
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,300
She won't.

315
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,500
Now, many people are doing business.

316
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,820
My buddies of the old fleet

317
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,900
have gone south for trucking business.

318
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,780
That's a faraway place, after all.

319
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,780
She doesn't know anyone there.

320
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,780
Qiulin was highly educated,

321
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,380
but he still failed to stay abroad.

322
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,900
It can't be that easy.

323
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,740
(Bathhouse)

324
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,060
I asked you not to drink too much,
but you gulped.

325
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,180
Come on.

326
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,420
Wipe your mouth.

327
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,980
Honey,

328
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,420
today is the festival.

329
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm just happy.

330
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,940
Don't restrain me.

331
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
I'm not restraining you.

332
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,860
You think I want that?

333
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,180
Who do you think you are?

334
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,580
You know what, honey?

335
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,220
After tonight,

336
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,380
your husband will soar.

337
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,620
Let me show you. Take this.

338
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,660
I'll soar like this.

339
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,820
All right.

340
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,780
Stop that. I'll wait to see you roar.

341
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,500
Let's go now.

342
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,660
Hey, Zhang.

343
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
How's the water today?

344
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,180
It's hot. Few people are in. Go.

345
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,020
Ok.

346
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,140
This is a bathhouse?

347
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,620
Come on.

348
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,220
I'll take a bath and sober up.

349
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,820
Don't do that.

350
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,140
- Let me do it.
- Go back!

351
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,660
I can't bathe, huh?

352
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,420
You can't. Let's go.

353
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,340
Then, let's go home to bed.

354
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,300
Try some French wine.

355
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,900
The taste is quite unique.

356
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,900
Come on.

357
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
- Ok.
- Taste it.

358
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,740
Don't worry, ma'am.

359
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,900
If you rent us
the bathhouse of the popsicle factory,

360
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,300
I promise we'll pay
another 10% of the annual rent.

361
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,380
No problem. Cheers, ma'am.

362
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,500
That's right, ma'am.

363
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,860
We'll pay another 10% of the rent.

364
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,900
Think about it. We're close.

365
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,260
You have to help us.

366
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,100
That's right.

367
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,620
If you rent it,

368
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,220
we'll feel more relieved.

369
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
- That's right.
- Right.

370
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,540
The point is our employees

371
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,140
rely on the rent for their allowance.

372
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,740
So, we have to be cautious.

373
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
But Jiayi,

374
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,860
I won't guarantee the result.

375
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,380
It's not up to me.

376
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,180
It's not up to my husband, either.

377
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,220
We need the approval from the committee.

378
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,260
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

379
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,540
- It makes sense.
- You have to.

380
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,580
It has to be fair...

381
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,740
- Ask them.
- Transparent.

382
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,620
- Yes. We need opinions.
- Right.

383
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,060
But from my point of view,

384
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,540
I prefer you, of course.

385
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,060
Ma'am, that's all

386
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,260
you ever have to say.

387
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,180
We're relieved, then.

388
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,220
I wondered

389
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,340
why I thought you were so nice.

390
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,540
Actually, last time I wished to tell you

391
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,180
I wanted you to be my godmother.

392
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,540
Ok.

393
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,900
- Godmother.
- Great.

394
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,100
A toast to you, Godmother.

395
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,060
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

396
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,100
- I'll drink it up.
- Ok.

397
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,100
Here I go.

398
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,380
(July, 1997)

399
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,300
(Cashier)

400
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,740
Honey.

401
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,140
Go check

402
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,980
if water is available.

403
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,860
Why?

404
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,540
What did you come for?

405
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,020
Get to work.

406
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,940
Now?

407
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,060
Fine.

408
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,940
I'm on it.

409
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,780
(Grand Opening
of Sifenlai Clothing Store)

410
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,140
We're opening today!

411
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,900
Big discounts!

412
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,300
Come take a look! Try anything you like!

413
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,820
Come in here! Welcome!

414
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,940
What's wrong?

415
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,220
Mom,

416
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,300
your daughter is in trouble.

417
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,060
What happened to Jiaxi?

418
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,420
Do you have only one daughter?

419
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,900
It's me.

420
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,820
I'm in trouble.

421
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,060
What kind of thing in this world

422
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,540
can actually trouble you?

423
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,420
Mom, my husband will rent a bathhouse.

424
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
He'll succeed.

425
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,220
That's a good thing.

426
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,060
We just need some working capital.

427
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,620
It's no use telling me about that.

428
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,780
Mom, I wouldn't ask you for help

429
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,500
unless I really had to.

430
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,660
How about this?

431
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,020
I won't ask for money.

432
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,340
May I borrow some?

433
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,180
I'll give you an IOU.

434
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,180
If I had some, I would give it to you.

435
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,660
But I really don't have money.

436
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,460
Your retirement pay for years

437
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,700
and the income of business.
Are they gone?

438
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,020
I spend money every month.

439
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,060
Your grandma never works to make money.

440
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,660
I pay for everything.

441
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,220
Mom, we'll do it the normal way.

442
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,220
I'll give you a high interest rate.

443
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,340
Please help me this once.

444
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,780
Just this once. Ok, Mom?

445
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,060
Why do you not believe me?

446
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,150
I really don't have money.

447
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,860
Can Jiaxi get some money, then?

448
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,500
No, either.

449
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,460
Besides, she's never asked for money.

450
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,060
Only you asked shamelessly.

451
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,220
Mom, stop lying.

452
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,460
How did she open that store?

453
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,860
We're just too generous

454
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,540
to complain about that.

455
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Mom, to be fair,

456
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,060
you've never been fair.

457
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,220
My younger sisters are lucky.

458
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
They always take advantage.

459
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,380
My elder sisters were born earlier.

460
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,100
They had everything they deserved.

461
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,620
I'm the middle daughter

462
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,860
and you never care for me.

463
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,260
You're being so ungrateful.

464
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,340
You've been taking the best advantage.

465
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,660
Since your first day at work,

466
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,820
you've been handling in less money.

467
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,740
I've never told your sisters.

468
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,260
I really don't have money.

469
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,060
If you're in an urgent need of money,

470
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,100
I'll go ask Jiali and Jiahuan.

471
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,500
Are you satisfied?

472
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,740
Yes.

473
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,940
Forget I even asked.

474
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,620
Honey,

475
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Mom came today.

476
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,620
She did?

477
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,260
Then,

478
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,460
she gave us some money.

479
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,460
You accepted it?

480
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,220
She forced me, I...

481
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
So, I accepted it.

482
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,860
Give it back to her.

483
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,540
She works so hard every month
to make a little money.

484
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,460
Ok. I'll return it tomorrow.

485
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,860
We should appreciate

486
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,620
Mom's kindness, right?

487
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,780
Hey.

488
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,980
How could you

489
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,500
change your mind so quickly?

490
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,300
What will we do, then?

491
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,620
Lunch is ready.

492
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,540
Be right there.

493
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,540
Jiaxi.

494
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,860
Glad you're home.

495
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,940
Come on. Come in here.

496
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,050
Come on.

497
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,620
Hurry. It's too hot.

498
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,300
(Young Yan Xiaoman)
Come on.

499
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,460
Put your things there.

500
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Mom, Mom. Who are they?

501
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,860
Relatives from my hometown.

502
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
They'll see a doctor.

503
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,260
My house is full.

504
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,860
They have no choice but to live here.

505
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,020
- It's ok.
- Mom.

506
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,100
You should have at least told me.

507
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,420
This is urgent.

508
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,700
And it's a medical emergency.

509
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,340
- Aunt, shall we...?
- Don't say that.

510
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,660
It's ok. When you're here,

511
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,740
make yourselves at home.

512
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,780
Do anything you like.

513
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,300
See? Right place, right time.

514
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,500
Lunch is ready.

515
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,260
Jiaxi, go get some bowls.

516
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,140
Go. Hurry.

517
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,460
- Mom.
- Dayong, help me.

518
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,340
Come on. Hurry.

519
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
Dayong, give me a hand.

520
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,500
Come on.

521
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,740
Xiaoman,

522
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,060
are there more chairs?

523
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,540
I don't know.

524
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,500
Be seated first.

525
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,060
Come on.

526
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,340
Don't be angry with your mother-in-law.

527
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,420
Just pretend to get along with her.

528
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,260
She has a problem.

529
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,420
But you live with Hongyu.

530
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,060
He has no problem.

531
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,140
He's a nice guy.

532
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,460
We think highly of him.

533
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,020
Sadly, Hongyu is a pushover.

534
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,980
We told you not to marry him.

535
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,140
Jiali!

536
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,460
That was a long time ago.

537
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,540
Why did you bring it up?

538
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,860
What's the point of saying that?

539
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,300
Can it help me face the fact?

540
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,820
The fact is you should go back

541
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
and stick together with Hongyu

542
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,580
to make money.

543
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,380
Then, buy a flat you like,

544
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,220
move out,

545
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,620
and live with Hongyu.

546
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,820
I'm not leaving. I'll stay here.

547
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,100
There's no space for you.

548
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,540
So, you can live here while I can't?

549
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,940
Come on, Jiaxi.

550
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,140
Don't be unreasonable.

551
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,540
We welcome you

552
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,660
to live back here.

553
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,620
But you and Hongyu
must get back together.

554
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,500
You can't come back

555
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,540
every time you fight with your husband.

556
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,300
You've got along with her for years.

557
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,140
Why can't you make peace yet?

558
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,340
It's easy for you to say.

559
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,300
You don't have one.

560
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,500
You never know how bad it feels
when she annoys you.

561
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,820
Hongyu's mom broke in

562
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,460
with five or six relatives.

563
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,540
What could I do?

564
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,500
What could you do? Two options.

565
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,940
Either you leave or she leaves.

566
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,140
I leave?

567
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,340
If I had somewhere to go, I...

568
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,740
I can't judge your family business.

569
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,100
I can talk to her for you

570
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,940
and quarrel with her.

571
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,540
But it can't solve the problem.

572
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,980
It'll make things worse instead.

573
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,900
You often come back here.

574
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,500
Isn't it inappropriate?

575
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,700
Mom,

576
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,300
I can't even come back here, huh?

577
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,820
I know you all despise me.

578
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,060
Nobody despises you.

579
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,420
You should win honor for yourself.

580
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,140
Ah, headache.

581
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,900
- Mom.
He's knocking.

582
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,540
Be right there.

583
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,940
Come on. Stop crying.

584
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,020
Smile for me.

585
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,940
Smile.

586
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,300
That's it.

587
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,200
Hello, Grandma.

588
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,740
Mom.

589
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,740
Xiaoman.

590
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,900
There you are, Hongyu.

591
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,220
Come on.

592
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,540
Your fourth brother has a son.

593
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,940
Your mother has a grandson.

594
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,420
We all feel happy for her.

595
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,180
We don't expect her to be very fair.

596
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,900
But she can't be ridiculous, huh?

597
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,380
Hongyu.

598
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,020
Don't try to mediate between them.

599
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,140
You need to be tough.

600
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,100
- Do you hear?
- Yes.

601
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,020
Jiali is right.

602
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,140
(Pay Phone)

603
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,140
We can put bath towels and keys

604
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,100
in it.

605
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,500
Bath towels.

606
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,540
Why is there...?

607
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,500
Hello.

608
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,540
Ouyang.

609
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,460
- This is Xiaoling.
- Xiaoling.

610
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,300
Where's Jiayi?

611
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,350
You talk to her.

612
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,740
She's too busy.

613
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Wait a minute.

614
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,500
Hey, Xiaoling.

615
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,220
Where are you?

616
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,420
Jiayi, I'm in Guangzhou.

617
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,900
What are you doing there?

618
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,620
Nothing.

619
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,340
When will you come back?

620
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,180
Not now, I think.

621
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,620
Jiayi,

622
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,100
can you lend me some money?

623
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,660
How much?

624
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,980
Two hundred.

625
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,260
Your account number.

626
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,300
Ok.

627
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,660
6445.

628
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,340
6... Pen and paper.

629
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,060
6445.

630
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,900
7765.

631
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,780
4321.

632
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,580
4321.

633
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,940
9876.

634
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,140
Ok, I'm on it.

635
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,420
Jiayi,

636
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,140
don't tell anyone else.

637
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
Don't worry.

638
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,580
Thanks, Jiayi.

639
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,140
Protect yourself when you're alone.

640
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,380
What did she say?

641
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,820
She borrowed money.

642
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,020
She's a drama queen.

643
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,500
Among the sisters, she had the best job.

644
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,420
She took over the job

645
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,580
handed down from Dad.

646
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,500
And then?

647
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
She lost it.

648
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,820
Now,

649
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,020
she has a tough time.

650
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,580
Maybe

651
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,140
the stupid are blessed.

652
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,460
If she were blessed, she wouldn't have called.

653
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,540
Did you say yes?

654
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,420
I had to.

655
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,780
She's my sister.

656
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,990
If your sister wanted to borrow money,

657
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,860
would you reject her?

658
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,940
And she sounds terrible.

659
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,780
I'm afraid

660
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,220
she can't even afford food.

661
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,740
Seriously?

662
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,820
Pretty, your fried rice noodles.

663
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,700
Sir, one more, please.

664
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
- Ok.
- One extra egg.

665
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,540
No problem, pretty.

666
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,860
(Plutocrat KTV)

667
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,260
- Who do you want?
- Is the manager in?

668
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,540
What's up?

669
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,380
Manager.

670
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,460
- Wait.
- Manger.

671
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,300
- You can't get in.
- Manager.

672
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,580
What's going on here?

673
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,100
Manager, this woman
insists on seeing you.

674
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,860
Hi, manager. I'm here to get a job.

675
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,900
I can sing.

676
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,180
Can you sing Cantonese songs?

677
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,340
What?

678
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,540
Cantonese songs.

679
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,300
Cantonese songs?

680
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,140
Leave now.

681
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,940
I can learn.

682
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,540
(What are you doing? Have you eaten?
Who do you want to see?)

683
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,340
Huan.

684
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,380
Huan.

685
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,500
Eat. He'll get more sleep
at the weekend.

686
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,460
Don't always spoil him.

687
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,460
The soy milk is hot.
Have fried dough sticks and fried eggs.

688
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,820
How's your work?

689
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,020
Good.

690
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,820
Taxi business is getting more difficult.

691
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,460
Want to quit again?

692
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,860
Have some perseverance, will you?

693
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,140
I didn't say I'd quit.

694
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,780
I mean, I'll work in another way.

695
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,180
My buddies and I have discussed it.

696
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,980
We'll start a business. It will work.

697
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,140
Those from the fleet
of the Grain Bureau?

698
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,540
They're my familiar buddies.
And they're reliable.

699
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,540
Ok.

700
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,820
Just don't ask me for a loan.

701
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,460
Hey, I haven't started it yet.

702
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,380
Your little plan

703
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,620
can't escape my eye.

704
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,900
Huan,

705
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,020
we've long meditated.

706
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,380
We'll start a company
for trucking business.

707
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,280
We've even got a name.

708
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,620
"Brother Transport."

709
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,540
Can you do something

710
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,020
to give us a loan?

711
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,860
It's not that I don't give you a loan.

712
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,740
But you aren't qualified for a loan.

713
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,180
Why can you get a loan?

714
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,580
How can you pay it back?

715
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,780
Suppose I give you a loan.

716
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,260
If you can't pay, who'll be responsible?

717
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,100
Before we start,

718
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,980
how do you know we can't pay it back?

719
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,140
You haven't even reviewed the profile.

720
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,060
How do you know we aren't qualified?

721
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,060
And we have you.

722
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,380
Your company has made so many loans.

723
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,940
Every year, a lot of loans

724
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,460
are approved by you.

725
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,340
Fang Tao,

726
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,580
business is business.

727
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,220
I can't break the rule

728
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,540
just because you're my husband.

729
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,820
The loans I've approved

730
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,300
are either government projects

731
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,780
or foreign investments.

732
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,100
They're serious public institutions.

733
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,260
What are you? Amateurs.

734
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,020
He Jiahuan!

735
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,260
What do you mean, amateurs?

736
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,580
We were the fleet of the Grain Bureau.

737
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,420
We joined in flood rescue many times.

738
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,740
We were always the first
to donate blood.

739
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,900
We made contributions.

740
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,940
We're the glorious fleet

741
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,180
of the Grain Bureau.

742
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,460
We aren't amateurs.

743
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,180
I'll go get the soy milk.

744
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,100
(Taxi)

745
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,580
Jiahuan isn't that kind of woman.

746
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,180
People change.

747
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,380
Besides, her career has taken off.

748
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,780
But I...

749
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,980
I haven't gone backward.

750
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,220
But I haven't improved.

751
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,980
If it continues,

752
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,220
we'll drift further apart.

753
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,420
What do you do, then?

754
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,260
I must start my own career.

755
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,780
What can ordinary people like us do?

756
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,220
I want to build out a fleet

757
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,820
for trucking business.

758
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,940
You'll set up a team?

759
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,180
For long or short distances?

760
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,940
Both. Mainly long distance, though.

761
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,780
What do you think?

762
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,500
Impressive, Tao.

763
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,580
I strongly support you.

764
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,580
I just have this idea.

765
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,420
But I have no money.

766
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,380
Get sponsors.

767
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,420
Get investments.

768
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,180
In this case, you need a proposal.

769
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,380
Proposal?

770
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,340
Will that work?

771
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,580
Yes, of course.

(Proposal of Transport Team
By Fang Tao)

773
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,620
It's printed out. Take a look.

774
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,380
Ok. Good.

775
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,700
Sir, is there a cover?

776
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,740
Or it may be stained.

777
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,860
Yes. Three yuan or five yuan.

778
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,900
Which one do you want?

779
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,260
Five yuan. I want the best one.

780
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,140
Jiahuan, I wasn't thoughtful enough.

781
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,900
I shouldn't have
talked about business at home.

782
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,620
Business is business.

783
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,180
I can't make you break the law

784
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,700
for the sake of our relationship.

785
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,780
In this proposal,

786
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,500
input and output are too fuzzy.

787
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,780
There's no prospect of profit.

788
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,900
Jiahuan, review it carefully.

789
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,180
It's a good project.

790
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,700
If something is confusing,

791
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,780
I'll rewrite it.

792
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,300
I have a meeting.

793
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,180
He Jiahuan,

794
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,460
you can't always see me with prejudices.

795
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,140
Will you approve everyone's project

796
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,460
except mine?

797
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm just sticking to the fact.

798
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,980
I'm not as good as you.
I didn't go to college.

799
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,620
But I can make progress, can't I?

802
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,140
Mr. Zhang, are you busy?

803
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,740
Please sell out

804
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
all my treasury notes, ok?

805
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,300
But the condition isn't very good now.

806
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,630
No problem.

807
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,810
Just sell them as soon as possible.

808
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,020
Tell me when it's done.

809
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,180

Jiali, will you really
not come tomorrow?

812
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,180
No, I won't.

813
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,100
Jiali, your son has a secure job

814
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,420
and makes money now.

815
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,780
You're free.

816
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,660
Not exactly.

817
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,180
I just want to have some rest.

818
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,020
Jiali, it's time for you
to have a grandson.

819
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,740
My son isn't even married.
I have no grandson.

820
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,340
I'm so jealous of you.

821
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,580
You'll go home and enjoy a great life.

822
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,140
Don't worry. Unless one is dead,

823
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,380
he'll always suffer.

824
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
- I should go.
- Thanks for this stall.

825
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,460
- Come often.
- Jiali.

826
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,860
Come and buy our vegetables.

827
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,700
I will.

828
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,980
Xiaofang.

829
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,660
- Xiaonian.
- One more.

830
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,420
Here.

831
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,940
I've been taking care
of this plant for years.

832
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,460
But it never blossoms.

833
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,540
I'm afraid our daughter

834
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,860
may have a crush on someone.

835
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,620
Is she in love?

836
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,860
Did she tell you or did you find it?

837
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,300
You didn't read her diary, did you?

838
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,220
Don't be ridiculous.

839
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,460
This is really important.

840
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,940
I'm not kidding.

841
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,740
Today, I saw her stay with Xiaonian.

842
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,500
They looked very close.

843
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,260
She won't have feelings for him, huh?

844
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,340
They grew up together.

845
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,900
Don't imagine things.

846
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,140
I'm not imagining things.

847
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,100
I just fear Xiaofang
would take a wrong path.

848
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,540
She'll go to college in Shanghai.

849
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,620
If she has a boyfriend now,

850
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,660
they may not end up together.

851
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,220
She'll be hurt, then.

852
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,780
Love at this age is beautiful.

853
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,660
You should let her experience that.

854
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,260
Yeah. You experienced that a lot.

855
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,500
Why am I involved?

856
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,060
If you worry about her,

857
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,660
just tell her.

858
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,460
She isn't a child and she'll understand.

859
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,820
She's usually sensible.

860
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,940
But once she's in love,

861
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,340
maybe she'll lose her mind.

862
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,620
I suffered in love, you know.

863
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,140
End of this topic.

864
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,820
Some kind of love

865
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,100
is just like a fire.

866
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,100
It blazes and goes out.

867
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,300
Love between us

868
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,460
is like water.

869
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,580
Slow flow is the right way

870
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,660
and the truth of life.

871
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,380
But I prefer the fire.

872
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,740
It's really passionate.

873
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,660
So, the two of us
go through water and fire.

874
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,060
We do anything for each other.

875
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,780
Won't you regret it?

876
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,660
No.

877
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,500
Glad to hear that.

878
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,060

880
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,180
- Mom.
- What are you doing?

881
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,340
Reading.

882
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,100
Even after the exam?

883
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260

884
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,540
Are you available now?

885
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,900
Mom wants to talk to you.

886
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,060
Let's sit over here.

887
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,300
What's up, Mom?

888
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,580
I'll get to the point, then.

889
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,740
Does Xiaonian like you?

890
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,860
No, Mom. What are you thinking?

891
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,900
Then, do you adore him?

892
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,860
I have no feelings for him, either.

893
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,660
You're going to college.

894
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,980
Maybe you'll even go abroad.

895
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,060
In many cases,

896
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,180
you'll learn to make a choice.

897
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,860
Maybe you and Xiaonian

898
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,260
belong in different worlds.
