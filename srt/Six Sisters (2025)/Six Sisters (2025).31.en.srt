=Episode 31=

15
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,060
Grandma, why do you want
to come here today?

16
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,740
Along the river lies our hometown.

17
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,860
- Nice cake.
- This is Great-grandma.

18
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,810
The birthday lady.

19
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,140
She's the queen of our family.

20
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,500
Don't be ridiculous.

21
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,340
You're so good at making stuff up.

22
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,060
Why don't you be a writer?

23
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,460
If you can't say anything nice, shut up.

24
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,060
Great-grandma is
the head of this family.

25
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,220
She's our backbone.

26
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,820
She's our central pillar.

27
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,940
This is my grandma,

28
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
the mother of six girls.

29
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,300
Yes. I have six daughters.

30
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,900
That's all I've done.

31
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,060
This is my eldest aunt.

32
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,340
She's hardworking.
Everybody listens to her.

33
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
Nobody listens to me now.

34
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,500
This is her husband, a retired cadre.

35
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,620
This is my cousin and his wife.

36
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,220
A perfect couple Tianjia'an.

37
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh, come on.

38
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,940
This is my second aunt,

39
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,340
the prettiest lady.

40
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,940
Uncle Fan isn't here, huh?

41
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,660
No. He's on duty today.

42
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,740
This is my mother.

43
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,700
She's very artistic.

44
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,740
I got my artistic genes

45
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,660
totally from her.

46
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,860
If you inherited even one-third,

47
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
you would be an artist.

48
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,940
This is my father,

49
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,980
born in the Year of the Tiger.

50
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,340
He used to be powerful and rich.

51
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,540
But now, he has a hard time.

52
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,460
Now, you can use idioms.

53
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,940
This is my fourth aunt.

54
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,660
She's a talented leader
who has dozens of subordinates.

55
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,700
She makes the most money.

56
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,700
Not really. I get paid monthly.

57
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,450
That's good enough.

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,700
It's so hard to do business now.

59
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,020
This is my sixth aunt,

60
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,820
a modern lady.

61
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,340
This is her husband

62
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,140
who loves tea eggs.

63
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
Oh, no.

64
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,460
I'm labeled.

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,420
"Love tea eggs."

66
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,340
This is my second cousin.

67
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,020
And the other two cousins

68
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,900
both study better than I do.

69
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,420
Aren't you ashamed?

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,500
What's your name?

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,700
Go there.

72
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,540
Hello.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,900
Ok.

74
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,460
Grandma, it's Xiaoling.

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,060
Oh, she's on the phone?

76
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,340
Xiaoling.

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
Aunt Xiaoling?

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,100
Yes. How's everything there?

79
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,020
Xiaoling?

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,260
All right.

81
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,060
Talk to your mother.

82
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,380
Hello.

83
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,500
Ok. Ok.

84
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,620
We're celebrating
your grandma's birthday.

85
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,220
Alright. Got it.

86
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,580
- Wait.
- Say something.

87
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,180
Yangyang, don't run away.

88
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,260
I won't.

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
Mom.

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
Yes.

91
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,460
Everybody is here.

92
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,300
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,540
She hung up?

94
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,820
Fine.

95
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,890
Jiayi.

96
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Come and have the cake.

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,980
- Hurry.
- Here.

98
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,460
I'll light the candle.

99
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,090
Come on.

100
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,660
Grandma, make a wish.

101
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,500
I don't need to make a wish at this age.

102
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,460
- You do.
- Say something nice.

103
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,620
In this case,

104
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,860
I hope our family will prosper

105
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,540
and you guys will be united.

106
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,780
Jiali.

107
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,340
You and your sisters must
take care of your mom when she's old.

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,940
Don't worry. Dad told us
what to do before he died.

109
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,300
Jianguo takes care of this family.

110
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,580
Jianguo.

111
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,340
I'll be relieved, then.

112
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
Blow out the candle.

113
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,980
Let's sing the birthday song.

114
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,540
♪Happy birthday to you♪

115
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,180
♪Happy birthday to you♪

116
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,900
♪Happy birthday to you♪

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,860
♪Happy birthday to you♪

118
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,580
Try again.

119
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,460
Blow higher.

120
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,340
Naughty boy.

121
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,860
The noodles are ready.

122
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,740
Come on.

123
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,740
Be careful, Mom.

124
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,660
Come here.

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,220
Ms. Liu's son Zhang Qiulin

126
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,780
went back to Hefei and got remarried.

127
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,660
Jiali, I'll say it one last time.

128
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,260
My divorce with Fang Tao

129
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,700
has nothing to do with Qiulin.

130
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,940
People

131
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,820
should keep a low profile.

132
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,620
Too much arrogance may make you fall.

133
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,700
It's ok.

134
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,820
Pieces for peace.

135
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,660
Come on. Step aside.

136
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,300
All right, Jiayi.

137
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
You go east and I go west.

138
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,540
See you, then.

139
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,580
I'll go west, too.

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,620
Let me go with you.

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
Why?

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,740
I'll go see your mother-in-law.

143
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,930
Why?

144
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,690
I quarreled with someone in the market.

145
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,100
Your mother-in-law stood up for me.

146
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,500
I'm quite grateful.

147
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Oh, come on.

148
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,540
What kind of tank do you like,

149
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,380
Xinxin?

150
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,580
- Mom.
- This one...

151
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,420
Hi, ma'am.

152
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,820
Oh, Jiayi. What are you doing here?

153
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,220
I'm here to see you.

154
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,940
Last time in the market,

155
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,220
glad you helped me.

156
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,700
Or I would have fought with that guy.

157
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,100
Relatives like us should

158
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,020
help each other. Don't say that.

159
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:45,980
Take your seat.

160
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,900
Who is this kid?

161
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,660
Mom's grandson.

162
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,740
- Right.
- Oh, I see.

163
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,140
He has a perfect nose

164
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,300
and big eyes.

165
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,700
Such a pretty boy.

166
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,620
Come on. Have some fruit.

167
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,220
You needn't have come

168
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,500
with the fruit.

169
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,140
It's my pleasure.

170
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,620
- Here, ma'am.
- Ok. Thanks.

171
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,100
- And you?
- I want an orange, Jiayi.

172
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
- Orange, huh?
- Mm.

173
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,820
You have some, too.

174
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,940
Alright. I will.

175
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,420
I'll have a banana, then.

176
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,900
He's a good boy.

177
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,500
But he can't live here.

178
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,980
Ma'am, no offense.

179
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,140
All kinds of people live

180
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,900
near the train station.

181
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,700
If a kid grows up here,

182
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,020
his life will be ruined.

183
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,620
Where else can we live, then?

184
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,860
Besides, this is our ancestral estate.

185
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,420
Our next-door neighbors

186
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,260
have been informed by superiors.

187
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,820
They'll move away

188
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,420
and return their rooms to us.

189
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,540
That's really wonderful, huh?

190
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,140
This is my house, after all.

191
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,260
Then, you can sell this house.

192
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,060
Isn't it great to live in a flat?

193
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,940
The flats in the community

194
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,220
are really good.

195
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,620
But this house is old.

196
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,660
Who will buy it?

197
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,440
You know what?

198
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,150
My husband is Jiaxi's brother-in-law.

199
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,860
How shall I put it?

200
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,580
He has a lot of brothers

201
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,560
who can't afford to live.

202
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,060
So, I'm thinking

203
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,300
I can buy a house for them

204
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
to serve breakfast

205
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,060
or sell tea eggs.

206
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,460
They can make a living, anyway.

207
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm not like Jiaxi.

208
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,180
She has a capable husband

209
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,860
and a helpful mother-in-law like you.

210
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,940
Our bathhouse has closed down.

211
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,650
We can only live on my layoff salary.

212
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,340
I even have to spare some money

213
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,260
for my brothers-in-law and relatives.

214
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,180
Think about it, ma'am.

215
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,180
How am I supposed to live

216
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,340
like that?

217
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,780
You really have a hard time.

218
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,100
How about you sell this house to me?

219
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,740
The point is I can't decide this.

220
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,140
Everybody knows that.

221
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,700
You're in charge of this family.

222
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,780
Well, the house price...

223
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
It's not a problem.

224
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,580
Quote us on the price.
Even if we have to sell everything

225
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
to collect the money,

226
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,260
we'll give you a good offer.

227
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,500
Fine.

228
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,380
I'll think about it.

229
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,020
You're so good at doing trickery.

230
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
When you want her house,

231
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,820
you should have at least told me.

232
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,760
I didn't mean to buy it.

233
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
We just brought that topic up.

234
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
That's a shabby house.

235
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,620
Will you really buy it?

236
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
I have no choice.

237
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,660
Ouyang has so many brothers

238
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,500
who have no food.

239
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,660
As their sister-in-law,

240
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,220
I can't just watch them

241
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,260
starve to death.

242
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,500
What if she asks for a lot of money?

243
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
She won't.

244
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,300
You and Hongyu will help.

245
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,340
She and I are relatives.

246
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,220
She wants to sell it
and I want to buy it.

247
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
The two of us

248
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,260
will both benefit.

249
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,220
So, who'll benefit more?

250
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,760
Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,260
- Honey, you're back.
- Honey.

252
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,280
I want to say something.

253
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,780
What is it?

254
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,420
Do you want to rise again?

255
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Isn't that obvious?

256
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,580
Answer me. Yes or no.

257
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,900
Yes, of course.

258
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,740
Good.

259
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,940
We must take the plunge.

260
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,990
How?

261
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,020
Sell this house.

262
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,280
This house?

263
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,980
Yes. Our home. This house.

264
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
Here.

265
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,740
Congrats, Ms. Wang.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,320
I should congratulate you, Ms. He.

267
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,980
Wish you a booming business

268
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,860
and a big fortune.

269
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,880
You made a wise decision.

270
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,060
In a better place,

271
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,780
your grandson will make a difference.

272
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,740
What's the saying again?

273
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,220
In ancient times, a mother... What?

274
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,980
She relocated three times for her son.

275
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,580
Now, Ms. Wang

276
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,980
has chosen a better place
for her descendants.

277
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,860
Very wise, indeed.

278
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,600
From your lips to God's ears.

280
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,350
Let's go, Jiayi.

281
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,780
You're grinning from ear to ear.

282
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,740
Fine. We'll be neighbors.

283
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,490
Don't worry. You go through your door.

284
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,170
I've warned

285
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,260
my brothers-in-law.

286
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,240
Whatever business they do,
they won't disturb you.

287
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,230
How will you thank me?

288
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,620
For what?

289
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,660
I did you a big favor.

290
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,740
Successfully,

291
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,780
I made your mother-in-law move out.

292
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,940
Right. Now, you're a cuckoo in the nest.

293
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,220
Don't use the wrong idiom.

294
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,740
Who do you mean cuckoo?

295
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,340
I'm a phoenix, at least.

296
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,060
Fine.

297
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,980
Bye.

298
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,420
See you, phoenix.

299
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,260
Ok.

300
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,780
Great-grandma.

- Grandma.
- Grandma.

302
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,580
Thanks.

304
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,340
- Here.
- Thank you.

305
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,300
Thanks, Grandma.

306
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,620
Your great-grandma and I

307
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,140
don't have too much money for you.

308
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,580
We'll say something nice, then.

309
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Hope you'll grow old together.

310
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,740
Have babies soon.

311
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,180
Grandma, don't worry.

312
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,220
I'll always take care of you.

313
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,660
This is your big day.

314
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,060
Don't say that.

315
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,760
To your parents.

316
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,750
Dad and Mom.

317
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,780
Thank you for what you've done for us.

318
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,260
My desire is

319
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,140
we can have a baby soon.

320
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,140
- Good.
- Good.

321
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,340
Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.

322
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,420
See?

323
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,700
Even my great-grandson is married.

324
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,700
I've lived for really a lot of years.

325
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,020
Go to bed early.

326
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,020
It was a busy day.

327
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,220
I can't calm down for now.

328
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,260
You have to calm down.

329
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,140
Our mission is done today.

330
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,700
No, actually.

331
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,860
Unless we're dead,

332
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,460
we won't stop worrying

333
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,740
about our child.

334
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,340
That's something to worry about later.

335
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,860
At least today, we can relax.

336
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,620
We can't. We must save money.

337
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,860
For what?

338
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,460
We need to buy a small flat.

339
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,300
You don't expect our children
to live with us forever, do you?

340
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,940
Even if they do, I won't accept that.

341
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,700
I don't want to be annoyed.

342
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,500
It's about the flat again.

343
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,340
We'll think about that later.

344
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Who?

345
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,340
- You don't have a fever. Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

346
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,780
Is there a pain in your gallbladder?

347
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,740
I'll get your medicine.

348
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,860
No, no.

349
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm a little bit tired.

350
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,140
I'll just take some rest.

351
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,060
Grandma, if you don't feel well,
go to the hospital.

352
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
No need.

353
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,580
I'm just too happy.

354
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,740
You go to sleep. I'm fine.

355
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,300
Jianguo, you go back.

356
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,380
I'll stay with Grandma.

357
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,660
Then...

358
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,460
Call me if you need me.

359
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,460

Yes.

362
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,460

something would happen.

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,100
My mother is missing.

377
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,460
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,420
She can't be missing.

379
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,460
Is she working overtime?

380
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,300
No.

381
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,100
Since yesterday, she hasn't come back.

382
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,060
Did she not call you?

383
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,860
See? I knew this day would come.

384
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,660
She abandoned her family.

385
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,100
She has probably eloped.

386
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,060
Stop trash-talking.

387
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,260
Let's go find your mother.

388
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,900
How grumpy.

389
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,900
Qiu.

390
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,660
I'm only familiar with you here.

391
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,340
Please tell me the truth.

392
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,940
Where has Director He gone?

393
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
Did nobody tell you?

394
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,900
I'm not staying at home lately.

395
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,140
Is she on a temporary trip?

396
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,020
Where has she gone?

397
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,340
Ms. He was taken away
by the Procuratorate.

398
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,460
The Procuratorate?

399
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,940
Jiawen,

400
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,940
your former sister-in-law's daughter

401
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,140
is a lawyer, isn't she?

402
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Ask her.

403
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,020
See if she has any reliable news.

404
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,300
Don't worry, Jiali.

405
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,160
I'll go ask her.

406
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,660
Fang Tao.

407
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,500
Don't bother about Grandma.

408
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,220
Focus on Jiahuan's case.

409
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,420
Glad Mom didn't hear us in her room.

410
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,820
Hongyu. Follow Fang Tao

411
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,020
wherever he goes.

412
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,780
If anything happens,

413
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,980
we'll think of a way together.

414
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,900
Jiali, Jiawen.

415
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,300
I'll count on you.

416
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,060
When it rains, it pours.

417
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,980
The tricycle should be ready.

418
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,140
It's hard to get a car
if someone's sick in the night.

419
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,980
It's so thoughtful of you.

420
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,380
Jiali,

421
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,020
you should prepare mentally.

422
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,860
Grandma is a blessed lady.

423
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,620
But there's nothing we can do.

424
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,180
It's like...

425
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,380
It's like the tricycle.

426
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,020
When it's time,

427
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,340
it's time.

428
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,540
I want Grandma to live to a hundred.

429
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,380
So do I.

430
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
It's our luck to have

431
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,820
such a reasonable grandma.

432
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,020
When she's here,

433
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
we have the backbone.

434
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,620
Tonight, I'll still stay with Grandma.

435
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Will you inform your sisters?

436
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,260
Not now.

437
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Grandma can't eat anything now.

438
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,780
If it goes on like this,

439
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,980
she can't live for too many days.

440
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
Grandma.

441
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,980
Mom, have a little bit of soup.

442
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,460
Mom, you have to eat and drink.

443
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,260
Will you get your sisters back?

444
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,180
Just in case.

445
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,340
Not now. We'll see.

446
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,860
Water.

447
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,300
Mom, go get some water.

448
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,140
Ok. I'm on it.

449
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,220
Grandma.

450
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,740
Jiali.

451
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,260
I'm here.

452
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,180
In the future,

453
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,580
take good care of yourself.

454
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,220
Don't worry, Grandma.

455
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,780
Don't count on your child.

456
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,620
I know.

457
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,420
I won't count on anyone.

458
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,780
Nothing else is a problem.

459
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,020
I just worry

460
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,380
your mom will be partial.

461
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,500
Don't just stand here.

462
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Go out. I'll talk to her.

463
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,420
Let's go.

464
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,220
Jiali, you go out, too.

465
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,740
I'll talk to Grandma alone.

466
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,300
Mom,

467
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,340
since Changsheng died,

468
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
we've been accompanying each other

469
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,780
for so many years before we realize it.

470
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,140
When the kids were little,

471
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,260
I always thought I couldn't

472
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,700
have a son.

473
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,380
And I felt guilty.

474
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,620
You told me daughters were the same.

475
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,500
You never blamed me.

476
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,820
When my kids grew up

477
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,340
and got married,

478
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,540
you also persuaded me, saying

479
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,700
children would be independent.

480
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,500
You enlightened me,

481
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,580
advising me to get a job.

482
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,540
You told me to sell pickled vegetables

483
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,100
and start my own career.

484
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,500
I always remember

485
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,380
what you've done for me.

486
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,500
But I have so many daughters.

487
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,660
You fear I will be partial.

488
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,340
Life is hard, Mom.

489
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,420
When you're here as my backbone,

490
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,980
all problems can be solved.

491
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
If you're really gone, I...

492
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,980
I'll lose my backbone.

493
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,220
I can't live without you, Mom.

494
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,580
Mom.

00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,580
Sorry for your loss.

565
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,660
(All the best, Grandma He)

566
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,060
Tao?

567
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,660
You...

568
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,580
Where's Jiahuan?

569
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,340
It's such an important thing.

570
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,260
You all knew it but didn't tell me.

571
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,100
Grandma died
and everything was in a mess.

572
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,580
We planned to tell you
after the problem was solved.

573
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,140
How can it be solved?

574
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,820
She's in prison now.

575
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,900
Oh my God.

576
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,900
Haven't you asked around?

577
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,860
What exactly happened?

578
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,780
Mom,

579
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,580
what could you do if we told you?

580
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,420
I...

581
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,660
We should do something

582
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,700
to prove she's innocent.

583
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,020
Mom, we're working on it.

584
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,340
But if Jiahuan has really
done something wrong...

585
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,900
She couldn't have done anything wrong.

586
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,340
Among my daughters,

587
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,380
she's the smartest one.

588
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,820
How would she do anything so silly?

589
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,340
Alright, Mom.

590
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,140
Don't get too anxious.

591
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
We'll think of a way.

592
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
There are laws.

593
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,580
The investigation takes some time.

594
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,420
You knew that, too?

595
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,620
I didn't know.

596
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,220
Tao, you...

597
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,940
You have many friends, don't you?

598
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,780
Mom,

599
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,420
I know all I need to know.

600
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,460
Now,

601
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,500
we can't do anything.

602
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,340
That's too bad.

603
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,620
Come on.

604
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,460
Mom,

605
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,580
most of the guests have left.

606
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,780
This is the list of consolation money.

607
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
And a ledger.

608
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,740
I've kept clear records.

609
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,580
Take a look.

610
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,060
Here's the money.

611
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,660
Jiayi!

612
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,980
Jiaxi?

613
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,100
Ouyang.

614
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,220
- I have something to ask you.
- What is it?

615
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,460
My mother-in-law's house.

616
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,460
You said you would serve breakfast.

617
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,060
Why are the walls being smashed?

618
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,900
We...

619
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,180
Let me explain.

620
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,580
We did some research.

621
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,940
The breakfast business

622
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,780
is oversaturated.

623
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,580
So, we will do another business.

624
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,900
What business?

625
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,220
- Hotel.
- Right.

626
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,140
I don't approve, then.

627
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,620
That'll be chaotic.

628
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,420
But her family also did that business.

629
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,660
Before I married Hongyu, anyway.

630
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,380
If you run a hotel,

631
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,140
all kinds of visitors will be messy.

632
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,860
That's lawful. It won't be messy.

633
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,980
Besides,

634
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,860
you and hotel guests

635
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,180
go through different doors.

636
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,860
We won't disturb each other.

637
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,700
Don't worry.

638
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
(Grandma)
Good for you.

639
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,100
Jiaxi,

640
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,820
hide what you don't deserve.

641
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,180
Don't be so blatant.

642
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,180
(Grandma)
Or people will gossip.

643
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,060
Honey,

644
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,060
it's kind of hard

645
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,740
to convince Jiaxi.

646
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,140
It's ok. Don't worry about her.

647
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,780
Did you see that?

648
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,140
Mom gave her all the money so soon.

649
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,780
What money?

650
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,140
The envelope in her bag.

651
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,260
Oh, it's Mom's.

652
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,540
Don't think too much.

653
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,980
That's not our money. No big deal.

654
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,380
We helped with the funeral, too.

655
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,380
And some of the money

656
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,660
was from our friends.

657
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,180
We'll give it back in future cases.

658
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,020
Listen to me.

659
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,180
Go ahead.

660
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,420
Our hotel will be renovated.

661
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,980
We also need money.

662
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Doesn't Mom know that?

663
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,860
When Jiaxi opened a store,

664
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,420
Mom must have given her a lot.

665
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
Now, it goes again.

666
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,220
(Freight transport and Removal Service)

667
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,260
Nice hair color.

668
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,540
I may hit you again.

669
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,820
That's ok.

670
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,580
But you must know how things are going.

671
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,860
The situation is,

672
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,180
Jiahuan's superior

673
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,580
must have done something wrong.

674
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,220
Two vice presidents and Jiahuan

675
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,740
are suspected as accomplices.

676
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,580
No way.

677
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,220
She would never do anything like that.

678
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,020
I know she wouldn't.

679
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,980
And I'm sure she didn't do that.

680
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,820
But we need proof.

681
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,180
I have friends in the Procuratorate.

682
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,020
I'm asking them to figure out more.

683
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,180
I just want to know
when she can come out

684
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,020
and when I can visit her.

685
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,580
It's hard to tell now.

686
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,180
By the way,

687
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,860
the lawyer you have...

688
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,060
He isn't capable enough.

689
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,980
I'm going to get a lawyer from Hefei.

690
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,220
Go ahead.

691
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,580
Get the best one.

692
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,180
I'll pay.

693
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,380
Come on, man.

694
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,380
Don't bother about money at this moment.

695
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,260
I'm going.

696
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,540
Qiulin.

697
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,180
Thank you.

698
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,220
Lunch is ready.

699
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,420
Mom,

700
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,820
let me tell you something.

701
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,780
Don't be so serious.

702
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,940
What is it?

703
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,980
Really?

704
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,180
That's awesome.

705
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,220
How far along are you?

706
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,140
Over a month.

707
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,620
Jianguo.

708
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,060
What are you talking about?

709
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,660
Congratulations to Mom.

710
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,980
She'll be a grandma.

711
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,620
She's pregnant.

712
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,980
That's great news.

713
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,500
- Sit down.
- Come on, sit.

714
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,620
This is so great.

715
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,660
Eat more.

716
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,180
You need well-balanced meals.

717
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,660
Xiaonian, peel shrimp for her.

718
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,900
Hurry.

719
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,620
From now on, don't do any housework.

720
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,780
Don't even wet your hands.

721
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,380
Tell Mom whatever you want to eat.

722
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,820
Mom, that's really sweet.

723
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,460
She's going to have a very nice year.

724
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,740
Of course, she will. Right?

725
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,220
Yes. That's right.

726
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,660
Very nice.

727
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,100
Too bad.

728
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,780
Your great-grandma can't see this day.

729
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,540
She must be watching in heaven.
