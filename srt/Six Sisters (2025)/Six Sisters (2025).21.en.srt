15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,640
I never intended for Jiali
to repay this money.

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,710
You didn't want her to repay it,

17
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,070
why did you ask her to write an IOU?

18
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,120
Isn't that embarrassing Jiali?

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,070
Back then,

20
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,760
when they disagreed us to get married,

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,230
wasn't that embarrassing?

22
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,590
People need dignity.

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,280
I don't value money that much.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,180
But since the money is in my hands,

25
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,180
it has to follow my rules.

26
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,980
In my world, I am the boss.

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,220
Is that wrong?

28
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,780
No. You are the boss.

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,100
(IOU)

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,540
When Xiaonian returns,

31
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,460
this money will be given to him as a gift.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,180
Alright.

33
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,620
What kind of business
does Jiali want to do?

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,180
Didn't I tell you? Old profession.

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,180
Selling vegetables?

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,220
What's wrong with it?

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,180
It's nothing ashamed.

38
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,140
Everyone's living their lives.

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,260
You come so early to buy vegetables.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,780
Look, it's not even dawn yet.

41
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,380
I can pick the best vegetables now.

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,180
If I come late, only the leftovers are left.

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,780
If you're not fully awake,

44
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,060
why don't you go back to sleep?

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,580
You should have said so earlier.

46
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,980
I'm already here.

47
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,580
When you were in the army,

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
didn't you get up
even earlier for training?

49
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,140
I'm just worried about you.

50
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,380
From now on,

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,860
you have to get up this early every day.

52
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,420
I don't mind.

53
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,940
I'll get used to it.

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,540
If you haven't woken up yet,

55
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,380
can you calculate the accounts correctly?

56
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,620
You are not good at math.

57
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,300
It's a small business,

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,380
it's a piece of cake for me.

59
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,340
Ok. Alright.

60
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,980
Let's go to the Bank today

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,740
and withdraw the money
to return to Jiayi.

62
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,380
Isn't it almost due?

63
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,580
If we withdraw it now,

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,580
we'll lose the interest.

65
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,980
Forget it. Let's return it to her.

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,860
It makes me feel at ease.

67
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,380
It seems you are quite confident.

68
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,580
Of course.

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,140
Alright. I'll wait for you
to make big money.

70
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,060
How can this make big money?

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,180
Hold on tight.

72
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,140
Carrot, potato, spinach

73
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,380
on sale. Ms.,

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,800
which vegetable do you want?

75
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,260
Radish and celery,

76
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,660
fresh vegetables on sale!

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
Girl,

78
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,340
how much is your spinach?

79
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,180
Fifty cents per jin.

80
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,220
Fifty cents?

81
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,580
Others are selling it at forty-five cents.

82
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
You want fifty cents?

83
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,620
Not all vegetables are the same.

84
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,100
Look at my spinach.

85
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,180
Let me see what's different.

86
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,020
It's very fresh.

87
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Too small.

88
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,220
The cheaper ones are too old to eat.

89
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,900
- It's too small.
- It's fresh and tasty.

90
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,460
- I won't buy it.
- Come on, buy some.

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,420
- No, no.
- It's Fresh.

92
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,620
Give me one cabbage.

93
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,620
Carrot, potato, spinach.

94
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,060
Buy some?

95
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,100
Well,

96
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,580
about moving back,

97
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,620
you'd better discuss it
with Mom and Grandma.

98
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,140
Yes, I was just about to say that.

99
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,220
Come, let me have a sip.

100
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,580
Be careful, it's hot.

101
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,020
Do you think Mom will agree?

102
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,540
Why would she disagree?

103
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,300
This is the only solution.

104
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,140
To sell vegetables at Longhu Market,

105
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,020
I have to get up at four in the morning.

106
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,460
It is the closest to there.

107
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,900
Besides, if I go back,

108
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,900
I will pay the meal fee.

109
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,460
That is a must.

110
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,340
I have made up my mind.

111
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,140
Love the job you do.

112
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,100
Since I've decided,

113
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,140
I must do this thing well.

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,860
You will definitely succeed.

115
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,660
What do you mean?

116
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,260
It sounds like

117
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,980
you're doubtful about this.

118
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,700
No, I'm praising you.

119
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,180
This time,
you're probably having a boy too.

120
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,460
I hope so.

121
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,060
Otherwise, my mother-in-law
would give me a hard time.

122
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,380
Jiali is back.

123
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,380
Mom,

124
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,540
I might stay at home for some time.

125
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,780
What happened?

126
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,740
I want to start a small business.

127
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,980
It's good you want to move back.

128
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,300
I'll tell your Grandma later.

129
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,980
She will be very happy.

130
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,540
What kind of small business?

131
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,940
Old profession: vegetable business.

132
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,340
Isn't that selling vegetables?

133
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,500
Yes, selling vegetables.

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,740
Jiali,

135
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,180
I admire you.

136
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,540
Admire what?

137
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,960
You can adapt to any situation.

138
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,580
Is your foreign trade business so soft?

139
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,540
You needn't go to work?

140
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,180
It's more than just soft,
if this continues...

141
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,980
I'm afraid I can’t even get wages.

142
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,380
Don't say that.

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,860
As long as your unit doesn't lay you off,

144
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,780
you should keep working.

145
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,380
Yes, I inherited this work,

146
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,780
I have to bear it for a lifetime.

147
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,780
You didn't say this as conditions were good,
but now start complaining?

148
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,980
The situation is bad for everyone now.

149
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,700
That's why
a family needs a division of labor.

150
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,060
My husband refuses to work outside.

151
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
If I also just sit and wait,

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,980
we'll have no hope for the future.

153
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,660
Look at our family,

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,940
Jiali has come out, and her husband is
in the Armed Forces Department.

155
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,940
Although Jiawen and her husband
haven't quit,

156
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,300
her husband is running a business,

157
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,580
he might earn big money.

158
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,140
Not to mention Jiayi.

159
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,980
She's rich.

160
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,900
Jiahuan's husband also came out.

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,980
He has skills.

162
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,620
Even if just like Hongyu,

163
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,660
driving a taxi.

164
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,540
This is also a money-making job.

165
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
As for my husband,

166
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,700
he's in a big pit,

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,900
just sitting at the bottom of a well.

168
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,980
You know, sometimes it's better
to stay still than to move.

169
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,700
Now you have a house,

170
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,060
and your job is stable,

171
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,700
you just need to raise a child.

172
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,460
His brother and sister-in-law
can also help,

173
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,860
what more do you want?

174
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Jiali, why don't you understand?

175
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,300
You need to keep up with the wave
of reform and opening-up.

176
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,780
Now China is like a parking lot,

177
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,990
there are parking spaces everywhere,

178
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,060
as long as you occupy one,

179
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,260
this is yours.

180
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,700
A parking lot?

181
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,660
Do you even have a car?

182
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
I have a bicycle.

183
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,900
Does a bicycle need a parking lot?

184
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,900
She's a fool.

185
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,220
When I give birth to this child,

186
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,900
I have to come back
for postpartum recovery.

187
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,020
Hongyu's Mom can't take care of me.

188
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,140
She must take care of you.

189
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,460
If she doesn't take care of you,

190
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,900
let her pay to find someone
to take care of you.

191
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,040
Mom, you don't care about me at all.

192
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,360
How could I not?

193
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,940
You're now heavily pregnant.

194
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,940
Stop running back and forth.

195
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,140
Stop exhausting yourself.

196
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,140
His mom can't cook well.

197
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,020
You're picky.

198
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,180
I'm not doing it for myself,

199
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,060
but for the sake of our future generations.

200
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,340
Jiaxi,

201
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,180
as a woman,

202
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,500
you have to go through this.

203
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
When the time comes, don't be afraid,

204
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,580
Mom will be with you.

205
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,060
You just need to smoothly
bring him into the world,

206
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,420
that's all.

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
- Blow on it.
- Ok. I'll do it.

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
Alright.

209
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Is it tasty?

210
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,570
Yes, it is.

211
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
Is it thick?

212
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
A bit.

213
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
- A bit thick.
- But it's okay.

214
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,920
Alright.

215
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
Jiaxi.

216
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,040
Continue.

217
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,880
No need, I'm full.

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,840
Come, let me show you something nice.

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Isn't it cute?

220
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,480
Isn't it beautiful?

221
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
Yes, it is.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,880
I made it by myself,

223
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,280
stitch by stitch.

224
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,960
You're so considerate, Mom.

225
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
That's right.

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
I carefully selected the colors.

227
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,080
This is suitable for boys,

228
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,920
right?

229
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,160
- Looks good.
- Mom,

230
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,280
its gender is not certain now.

231
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,440
Yes, never mind. It's our child.

232
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,440
- Mom,
- Looks good.

233
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,680
it's getting late.

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,840
Let's rest.

235
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,680
Pregnant women cannot lack sleep.

236
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,280
It's okay.

237
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Yes, sleep.

238
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,480
Sleep well.

239
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,950
Once you are well-rested,

240
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,040
our first child will grow up
strong and healthy.

241
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Go to sleep.

242
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,800
Good night, Mom.

243
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,040
Sleep.

244
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,160
Hurry up.

245
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
She goes downstairs?

246
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,520
- Yes.
- Come over.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
Your Mom did it on purpose.

248
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,480
She meant well.

249
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,600
Do you think so?

250
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,760
She didn't mean well at all.

251
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,520
She just wants to achieve her own goals.

252
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
How could she make it by herself?

253
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,360
Does she have the skill to make this?

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
Check it by yourself.

255
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,320
- She bought it?
- Yes.

256
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,120
This little duck is too difficult for her.

257
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,200
Your Mom always lies.

258
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,510
Whether it's bought or woven,
it's the same.

259
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
My Mom spent money.

260
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,360
Tell me, do you want a boy or a girl?

261
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
A girl.

262
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,620
Feed me.

263
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:45,460
(Huainan AH Trust Investment Corporation)

264
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,620
(People-oriented Economic Development)

265
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,700
The company has decided

266
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,580
to appoint Comrade He Jiahuan

267
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,220
(Promotion Notice)
as the Director of Foreign Business.

268
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,820
(Director's Office)

269
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,020
Congratulations, Director He.

270
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,060
You deserve it.

271
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,460
In the future, under your leadership,

272
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,780
we will definitely make rapid progress.

273
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,580
It's all thanks to your support
for my work.

274
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,830
Let's work hard together in the future.

275
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,500
Alright, Director He,

276
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,580
I'll go to work now.

277
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,820
Director He.

278
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,500
Hongyu, me, your Fourth Sister,

279
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,650
when will my husband
be able to drive a taxi?

280
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,020
I've already paid the deposit,

281
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,780
and asked Hongyu for help.

282
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,060
You have to wait in line to drive a taxi.

283
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,700
It's quite profitable.

284
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,020
Did you hear what I said?

285
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,620
I deliver goods,

286
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
not people.

287
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,500
No.

288
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,380
What's the difference
between goods and people?

289
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,820
Just treat people as goods.

290
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,120
It's like being in a convoy.

291
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,900
Get off at the destination
and you make money.

292
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,460
Where can you find such a good deal?

293
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,660
I only serve goods,

294
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
not people.

295
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,860
You are the master,

296
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,900
and you don't serve people.

297
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,020
In today's society,

298
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,220
who doesn't serve others?

299
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,700
Do you think I am

300
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,800
enjoying a carefree life outside?

301
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,300
Do you think I'm the Director now

302
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,260
and I can do anything I like?

303
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,220
Back in the days when I was the Deputy,

304
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,420
I deal with the Director
and the Manager internally,

305
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,340
and externally, I deal with the clients.

306
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,620
At home, I take care of the children,

307
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,860
and you, too.

308
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,780
Director He,

309
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,820
it must be hard for you.

310
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,180
Don't eat too much at night.

311
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,980
You can't put a crown on a clown

312
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
and expect a king.

313
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,900
As a laid-off worker,

314
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,420
this is all I can do now.

315
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,740
(Handsome Siblings)

316
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,020
In the future,
don't buy so much at one time.

317
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,700
This isn't much.

318
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,260
And you have to choose.

319
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,180
You can't buy everything.

320
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,580
I just began to do this,

321
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,900
just considering it as paying tuition.

322
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,020
I discovered that

323
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,260
leafy vegetables can't be stored.

324
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,380
They don't last.

325
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,820
They must be sold soon.

326
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,450
So, I have to make small profits
and quick turnover.

327
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,540
How about this?

328
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't sell these anymore.

329
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,120
You can sell Tofu.

330
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,980
Look at those few shops.

331
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,100
Their Tofu is selling well.

332
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,020
They are from Bagong Mountain.

333
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,380
Their Tofu skills are all ancestral.

334
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,140
Each of them has a Tofu Workshop.

335
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,100
How can I compete with them?

336
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,660
Selling Eggs.

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,260
Isn't Weiguo familiar with the people
at the Chicken Farm?

338
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,260
Ask him to contact them
and secure some supplies.

339
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,300
You can also get my eggs.

340
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,860
How many do you have?

341
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,420
They are not enough for you to eat.

342
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,860
I'll ask Weiguo later.

343
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,540
Have some eggs.

344
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,500
Jiali,

345
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,060
- Ms. Liu is here.
- Wow, you've started a business.

346
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,340
I was laid off,

347
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,420
just trying to make a living.

348
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,620
Isn't Jianguo's wages not enough
to live on?

349
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,420
We have a son to raise.

350
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,700
Isn't your son joining the army?

351
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,140
After discharge,
he'll get a guaranteed job.

352
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,060
If I were you,

353
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,900
I would simply

354
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,140
retire.

355
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,940
I'm not that old yet.

356
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,220
I can still do some work.

357
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Lady,

358
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,860
her eggs are good.

359
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,980
Why, have you tried them?

360
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,260
Of course. Listen,

361
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm a regular customer.

362
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,140
Did you see that?

363
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,300
Zaolin free-range eggs.

364
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,220
They're nutritious.

365
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,740
From Zaolin, right?

366
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,100
Free-range ones.

367
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,500
These eggs are quite clean.

368
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,020
Well, you see, she is clean too.

369
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,260
- Get some?
- Okay.

370
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Give me ten.

371
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,420
Alright.

372
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,940
Here you are, ten.

373
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,780
- Okay.
- Two yuan.

374
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
Come back if it's tasty.

375
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,340
- Alright.
- Thank you.

376
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,660
See you.

377
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,820
Thank you for bringing me business.

378
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,660
It's the least I could do.

379
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,820
Give me twenty of them.

380
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
Alright.

381
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,420
- Take the money.
- No.

382
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,230
Why not?

383
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,260
You're running a small business.

384
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,550
Just do as you should.
Don't be too polite.

385
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,950
Listen, even your Mom's Eight Treasures Dish,

386
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,060
I never take it for free.

387
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,060
Isn't this our Jiali?

388
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,340
Why are you standing on the street here?

389
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,860
I'm learning from you.
You're experienced.

390
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,700
Could you share some tips with me?

391
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,540
Why be modest?

392
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,700
What tips do I have, right?

393
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,020
I just deal with things as they come.

394
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,660
Ms. Liu, your son should be
coming back soon, right?

395
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,300
Yes, soon, he'll be back soon.

396
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,860
China's money is not enough to earn.

397
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,540
He went to America to make money.

398
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,860
Impressive.

399
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,220
Come on, take this.

400
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
Give this to Jiaxi
to supplement her nutrition.

401
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,020
No need.

402
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,820
Look.

403
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,260
You're a real sister.

404
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,300
You treat me differently.

405
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,860
Alright, I'm leaving now.

406
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,740
She's leaving like this?

407
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,860
No.

408
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,020
With her coming, you waste two days?

409
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,940
As sisters, we don't count this.

410
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,780
I really dislike people like that.

411
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,780
How unashamed she is!

412
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,060
See you, Ms. Liu.

413
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,140
- See you.
- Okay.

414
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,900
Jiali.

415
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,460
When did you start doing this?

416
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,780
I didn't even dare to recognize you.

417
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,020
A few days ago.

418
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,340
Selling vegetables, my old profession.

419
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,460
Let me help you.

420
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,620
Let's go.

421
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,260
You should find something to do.

422
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,260
But the key is, this is too tiring,

423
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
and it wastes time.

424
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,940
I'm used to it.

425
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,900
I will establish a branch

426
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,060
for my bakery at Longhu Hotel.

427
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,660
I've found the venue.

428
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Now I just need a store manager.

429
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,260
Why don't you come?

430
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,140
You're joking.

431
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,700
How could I possibly do it?

432
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,900
Don't be so quick to refuse

433
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,860
I'm trying to recruit talent.

434
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,820
If you come to be

435
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,540
the store manager for this branch,

436
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,060
the performance will surely
surpass the main store.

437
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,140
Let's say goodbye here.

438
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,260
Alright.

439
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,260
Think about it carefully.

440
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,980
Did he really say that?

441
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,380
What's wrong?

442
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,060
Do you think he wouldn't say that

443
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,540
or do you think I'm not talented?

444
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,580
Of course, you are talented.

445
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,620
So, what's your opinion?

446
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,100
I have no opinion. It's up to you.

447
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,740
Look.

448
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,260
I knew you would get angry.

449
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,780
I'm not angry,

450
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,940
not even the slightest bit unhappy.

451
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,740
If he really needs a person,

452
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,980
and you really want to do it,

453
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,380
I will fully support you.

454
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,180
You're not jealous at all?

455
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,820
How many years have passed?

456
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,460
Am I still holding a grudge?

457
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,580
It's because you have a big heart,

458
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,860
but it doesn't mean
others won't hold grudges, either.

459
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,100
Who?

460
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,460
Qiufang.

461
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,580
Weimin meant well,

462
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,380
but I have to think about Qiufang.

463
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
Besides,

464
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,780
I'm not familiar with the work
at the bakery either.

465
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,060
It'll be awkward

466
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,660
if I get involved.

467
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,260
I'd rather stick to my own

468
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,460
small shabby stall.

469
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,980
Although it's small and shabby

470
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,380
and might not make money,

471
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,020
at least I have the final say.

472
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,980
That's true.

473
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,860
Independent.

474
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,380
Self-reliant.

475
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,380
Even in poverty,
we must maintain dignity.

476
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,180
I have some news to tell you.

477
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,580
Is it good or bad?

478
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,860
Is it that our son sent a letter?

479
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,020
No, it has nothing to do with him.

480
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,820
Well, it's not proper.

481
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,340
It does have something to do with him.

482
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
What is it?

483
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,180
- Hurry up and tell me.
- Listen to me.

484
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,620
My work unit

485
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,060
is going to allocate houses.

486
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,900
Really?

487
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,980
If we return the old house,

488
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,060
we can get a new one at Longhu.

489
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,660
Do you have enough points?

490
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Just enough for a two-bedroom apartment.

491
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,500
A two-bedroom apartment.

492
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,780
Which floor?

493
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Which floor do you want?

494
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,580
How many floors are there in total?

495
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,460
Four floors.

496
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,380
Anyway, let's not take the first floor.

497
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,180
Alright.

498
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,580
It's up to you.

499
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,580
Once we get the keys,
we'll move in right away.

500
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,620
Okay.

501
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,380
Xiaoling.

502
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,940
Hongyu?

503
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,740
Where are you going?

504
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,780
Anywhere, just drive.

505
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,140
Were you arguing with Zhenmin?

506
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,260
He and I are like chalk and cheese.

507
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,780
We are not on the same wavelength at all.

508
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,340
I can't continue like this.

509
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,260
Let's go.

510
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,340
Okay.

511
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,660
Who is it?

512
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,380
Coming.

513
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,260
Zhenmin.

514
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,100
Qiufang.

515
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,060
Go play with your aunt.

516
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,580
Zhenmin, what's wrong?

517
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,380
Didn't Xiaoling come back with you?

518
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,260
I don't know.

519
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,580
Xiaofang,

520
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,060
take your brother inside to play.

521
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,100
Okay.

522
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,180
- Come on, baby.
- Okay,

523
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,460
let's go inside and play.

524
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,220
You had a fight again.

525
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,180
You're already the head of the family.

526
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,020
Can you be a bit more magnanimous?

527
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,620
Stop fighting at every turn.

528
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,380
The point is you always run home
when you fight.

529
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Zhenmin,

530
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,100
what happened?

531
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,940
It's disappointing.

532
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,860
Tell us if there is any problem

533
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,340
and we'll solve it together.

534
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
Liu Xiaoling…

535
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,420
Liu Xiaoling is a murderer!

536
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,620
What?

537
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,980
Liu Xiaoling, I'm telling you,

538
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,940
you made a wrong decision.

539
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,020
It's such a big matter,

540
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,780
how could you decide on your own?

541
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,780
I had no choice.

542
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,500
The doctor said if I didn't operate,

543
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,740
it would be very dangerous.

544
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,660
Nonsense.

545
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,860
You're just making excuses for yourself.

546
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,580
You're the child's mom,

547
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,740
Zhenmin's its dad,

548
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,380
he has the right to know.

549
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,380
I called him, but he didn't go with me.

550
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,620
Tang Zhenmin,

551
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,940
I'll ask you one last time.

552
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,120
Are you going to the hospital with me?

553
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,860
Are you sick?

554
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,980
No, but I need to go to the hospital.

555
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,980
If you're not sick,
why are you going to the hospital?

556
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,820
Are you going or not?

557
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,730
No.

558
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,460
Nonsense.

559
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,220
He doesn't have any
sense of responsibility at all.

560
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,660
He has no energy at work,

561
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,180
neither after work.

562
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,620
He doesn't do anything at home.

563
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,820
I really don't dare to
have another child with him.

564
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,340
Wasn't that your own choice?

565
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,600
We all disagreed with your marriage
at the beginning.

566
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,380
You were so determined.

567
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,260
Since you chose this path,

568
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,340
you should live your life well.

569
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,340
- I don't want to continue.
- What do you want to do?

570
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,580
- One word.
- I won't let you say that word.

571
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,060
If you don't think for yourself,

572
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,420
won't you think for your son?

573
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,580
Do you want Yangyang to lose home?

574
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,940
Get that idea

575
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,340
out of your mind.

576
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,940
Nothing like this has ever happened
in our family.

577
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,580
Take a step back
and everything will be fine.

578
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,220
This matter is mostly her fault,

579
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,260
but you are not entirely blameless either.

580
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,020
Conflicts between couples
accumulate over time.

581
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,740
She wishes she could
become rich overnight.

582
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,380
Xiaoling has unrealistic expectations.

583
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,340
So you need to work with her more,

584
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,020
communicate more
and understand each other.

585
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,340
Both your brother and I know you are a

586
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
game enthusiast.

587
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,980
As soon as you get off work,
you just play games.

588
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,380
Xiaoling doesn't necessarily

589
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,180
want to go out and earn a lot of money.

590
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,020
The key is that she

591
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,380
wants to see you in a good mental state.

592
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,820
She needs an attitude from you.

593
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,980
What attitude?

594
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,820
She wants me to leave foreign trade.

595
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,980
Qiufang, do you think I can agree?

596
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,220
No, you can't agree to that,

597
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,180
but you can talk to her nicely.

598
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,380
A couple are in the same boat in life.

599
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,220
You can't have two hearts.

600
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,980
Later, come with me to
apologize to Xiaoling.

601
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,860
Why should I apologize to her?

602
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,020
She killed my child
and I still have to apologize to her?

603
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,220
Shouldn't she apologize to me first?

604
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,020
Your attitude and statement are wrong.

605
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,060
Having a child
is a matter for both of you.

606
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,020
Now your relationship is like this.

607
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,340
If you really want it,

608
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,460
can you talk about it later?

609
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
Hurry up and make a statement.

610
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,980
I'm sorry.

611
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,780
This matter was my fault,

612
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,460
but you're wrong, too.

613
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,740
What did I do wrong?

614
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Are you sincerely apologizing?

615
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,340
Would I have had surgery
if it weren't for you?

616
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,860
Liu Xiaoling.

617
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,380
Let him finish speaking.

618
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,420
I still want to live with you.

619
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,860
Is it meaningful to
say such insincere words?

620
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,780
Alright,

621
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,580
it's your turn.

622
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,020
I'm sorry.

623
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,780
What did you do wrong?

624
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,020
I shouldn't have had an abortion

625
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
without your consent.

626
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,420
And then?

627
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
There's no "then".

628
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,180
There's no future with him and me.

629
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,500
Did you forget

630
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,580
why you two get together
in the beginning?

631
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,460
Back then, you loved each other so much.

632
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
What happened now?

633
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,540
Whenever you're about to argue,

634
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,380
just think about

635
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,940
how you two got together in the beginning.

636
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,980
Reflect more on each other's good qualities,
and you won't argue.

637
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,060
(Labor Ward)

638
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,820
(Labor Ward)

639
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,620
Hongyu,

640
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,780
stop pacing around here.

641
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,260
You're making me dizzy.

642
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,260
You feed Jiaxi so many eggs.

643
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,820
Look how chubby she is.

644
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,130
It's not good for giving birth to a child.

645
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,140
Isn't it all for our child's sake?

646
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,020
What's wrong with being a bit chubby?

647
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,630
Being chubby gives strength for birth.

648
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,620
What do you know?

649
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,500
How is she?

650
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,380
Jiaxi's Mom.

651
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,220
She's still inside.

652
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,180
How long has it been?

653
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,660
Five or six hours.

654
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,780
Jiaxi has always been weak.

655
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,740
Weak?

656
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,180
She is the strongest.

657
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,900
- Exactly.
- No worries.

658
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,380
Who is the family of the patient?

659
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,220
Here we are.

660
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,060
I am.

661
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,780
The baby's weight is too large,

662
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,760
a C-section might be necessary.

663
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,820
No C-section!

664
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,060
A C-section is not good for the baby.

665
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,420
Is it a boy or a girl?

666
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,530
It's still uncertain at the moment.

667
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,140
Currently,
if a C-section is not performed,

668
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,340
both the baby and the mother
might be at risk.

669
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,620
You all discuss it

670
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,460
and sign here.

671
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,980
Hongyu's Mom,

672
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,060
a C-section is needed.

673
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,020
If we disagree, it will be too late.

674
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,940
- Wang.
- No, we can't do the C-section.

675
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,780
What if it harms our child?

676
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,620
Well, I mean

677
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,580
a C-section always requires
making an incision.

678
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,020
That poses a risk to Jiaxi.

679
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,860
You know that, right?

680
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,780
You make a decision.

681
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,340
I agree.

682
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,660
Sign.

683
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:55,300
(Patient's spouse's signature)

684
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,700
Thank you.

685
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,300
Are you silly? You...

686
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,060
(Labor Ward)

687
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,180
Seven point six jin.

688
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,490
A girl.
Both mother and daughter are safe.

689
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,420
Congratulations!

690
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,020
Congratulations! You become a father.

691
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,740
Well,

692
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,180
I have something to do.

693
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,220
I'll head back first.

694
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,380
You stay here.

695
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,220
What kind of person is this?

696
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,740
Forget it, it's normal.

697
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,060
Jiaxi will do her postpartum recovery
at home.

698
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,580
Xiaoman.

699
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,300
She's so beautiful.

700
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,780
Look, double eyelids.

701
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,340
Alright, Jiaxi,

702
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,820
stop shedding tears.

703
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,380
Yes, Xiaoman is so pretty.

704
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,300
She will make big money.

705
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,980
What's wrong,
did I say something wrong?

706
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,180
Alright, Jiaxi.

707
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,900
If you don't want her,
just give her to me.

708
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,340
Zhicheng has been clamoring
for a younger sister.

709
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,380
That's right. It's great to have a daughter.

710
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,140
Look at these little clothes,
they're so fun.

711
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,300
You didn't see how his Mom acted.

712
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,620
His Mom was just confused now.

713
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,780
Once she figures it out,

714
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,420
things will go back to
how they should be.

715
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,340
Isn't Xiaoman her descendant?

716
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,060
Jiaxi, have something to eat.

717
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,940
Hongyu,

718
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,260
your wife is here for postpartum recovery.

719
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,860
Your whole family doesn't show up.

720
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,460
What do you mean?

721
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,900
Jiali, you are really wronging me.

722
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,140
I come here every day.

723
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,060
I want to set up a bed and stay here.

724
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,660
Jiaxi doesn't allow it.

725
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,060
What is your Mom's attitude?

726
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,460
My Mom's opinion is that

727
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,340
I should take her back home.

728
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,380
She will take care of her.

729
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,660
Hongyu,

730
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,900
you need to be a good bridge

731
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,660
between Jiaxi and your Mom.

732
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,700
If she can't take care of Jiaxi,

733
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,980
she should give Jiaxi some money.

734
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,500
I submit my wages to her every month.

735
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,580
Yours is yours.

736
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,260
Your Mom's is your Mom's.

737
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,300
What's the point of getting married?

738
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,140
I wonder.

739
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,740
Hongyu, tomorrow,

740
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,600
you come to

741
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,780
bring Xiaoman and Jiaxi back home.

742
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,820
Mom,

743
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,740
I'm not going back.

744
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,060
If Hongyu's Mom asks you to go back,
you should go.

745
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,700
Are you staying with her in the future?

746
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,300
Wait until she finishes the recovery period.

747
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,980
No need.

748
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,380
The recovery period is the best time

749
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,430
for them to get used to each other.

750
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,340
Drive the car here tomorrow.

751
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,130
You haven't fallen asleep yet.

752
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,660
I'm waiting for you. Hungry?

753
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,740
What do you want to eat?

754
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,740
What do we have?

755
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,820
Noodles, okay?

756
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,660
Perfect.

757
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,060
Wait for it.

758
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,500
He's sleeping soundly.

759
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
I've been missing your noodles so much.

760
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,580
Delicious.

761
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Your face…

762
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,980
What's wrong?

763
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,060
Take a look.

764
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,940
Your face

765
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,860
is yellow.

766
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,540
Is it?

767
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,500
It is a bit yellow.

768
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,660
It's probably the lighting.

769
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,300
(Outpatient Department,
Huainan No. 1 People's Hospital)

770
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,220
(Payment Window)

771
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,300
Come on, change your clothes.

772
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,660
It's not a serious illness.

773
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,060
Why should I be hospitalized?

774
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,300
The illness isn't severe,

775
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,140
but it's Hepatitis A.

776
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,420
The doctor advised hospitalization.

777
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,620
Is it really that serious?

778
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,420
It's not that serious.

779
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,260
The doctor suggested it.

780
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,100
Come on.

781
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,540
It will delay my work.

782
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,820
- Lv.
- Lv.

783
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,100
- Weiguo.
- Why are you here?

784
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,420
I just come to visit you.

785
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,500
Thank you.

786
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,740
It's a minor illness. I will be fine soon.

787
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,140
Lv, you come just in time.

788
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,300
Can you help me persuade him?

789
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,260
Him?

790
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,300
No need to persuade.
He listens to you the most,

791
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,620
isn't that right?

792
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,450
Alright, I'll change.

793
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,660
I'll change.

794
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,940
That's right, just take a good rest.

795
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,500
I will take care of the work in Sichuan,

796
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,100
you can rest assured.

797
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,290
Come.

798
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
Alright, please take more care
of it for me.

799
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,580
- Don't worry.
- When I'm discharged,

800
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,940
- I'll take over and you have a rest.
- Okay.

801
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,980
Thank you, Lv.

802
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,260
- Rest assured.
- Thank you for your gifts.

803
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,540
Weiguo is just too frugal.

804
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,990
I tried to persuade him,
but it didn't work.

805
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,660
He ate street food for about a month.

806
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,260
Now I finally understand

807
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,540
health is truly the foundation
of everything.

808
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,180
- Without a healthy body,
- Yes.

809
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,820
everything is nothing.

810
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,890
Alright, don't see me off anymore.
I'm leaving.

811
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,300
Okay, thank you, Lv.

812
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,260
Call me if you need me.

813
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,180
This is why we say
before giving you big responsibility,

814
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,660
you'll suffer both from the mind

815
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,700
and physiques.

816
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,100
As long as you get through this,

817
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,430
you will definitely succeed.

818
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,500
We don't seek success,

819
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,740
we just seek peace and safety.

820
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,060
Jiahuan, I heard you got promoted.

821
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,860
I just have three or four subordinates.

822
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,340
What's the difference?

823
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,380
That's not the same.

824
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,780
Anyway, you're a leader now.

825
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,700
Looking at it now,

826
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,500
the financial system is stable.

827
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,100
Yes, we can't even make ends meet
in foreign trade.

828
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,300
Is it that bad?

829
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,980
Currently, foreign trade is
just barely surviving.

830
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,340
Both of us work in this field.

831
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,100
So, it's a lesson learned,

832
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,980
the eggs should not be put in one basket.

833
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,180
No matter you're rich or not,

834
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,940
you can live a life.
Don't compare yourself to others.

835
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,940
Jiawen,

836
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,180
I should go to work now.

837
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,980
- Okay.
- Go and work now.

838
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,140
Let's not disturb Weiguo's rest.

839
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,080
- Alright.
- We'll leave first, Weiguo.

840
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,660
- Have a good rest.
- We'll come again when we have time.

841
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
- Okay.
- Don't come if you're busy.

842
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,700
- You do you.
- We'll leave.

843
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,460
Take care, Weiguo.

844
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
I'll see them off.

845
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,300
Go ahead.

846
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,700
(Ward Six)

847
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,900
Stop here, Jiawen, go back.

848
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,700
It's enough for you to visit us.
I can't accept it.

849
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,700
Visiting is enough.

850
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,660
I can't take the money.

851
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,940
Besides, Fang

852
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,340
was also laid off.

853
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,660
Take the money.

854
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,460
Alright, next time.

855
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,380
Let's go.

856
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,660
We're leaving.

857
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,660
- We're leaving, Jiawen.
- Bye.

858
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,100
Jiahuan, if you planned to give money,

859
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,700
you should have told me in advance.

860
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,340
Aren't you putting me
in an awkward position?

861
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,180
It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

862
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,140
Sorry about that.

863
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,700
Besides, you brought fruit.

864
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,200
- How is that the same?
- Money or strength,

865
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,180
contribute whatever you have.

866
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,140
Why be so particular among sisters?

867
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,460
Right now,
I have neither money nor strength.

868
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,300
Are you still worried about your job?

869
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,500
You see, so many people around me

870
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,540
have become successful.

871
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,580
With all my skills,

872
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,180
why can't I find a place to use them?

873
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,660
What skills do you have?

874
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Just a job.

875
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,380
It is taken over from Dad.

876
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,660
I've told you long ago,

877
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,900
being greedy for small gains
leads to big losses.

878
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,380
Jiahuan!

879
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,980
(Early 1996)

880
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,820
Si,

881
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,300
what about this,

882
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,380
you stay here and

883
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,620
keep an eye on them to finish the work.

884
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,980
Then, distribute this money

885
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,180
to them as wages.

886
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,660
How much does this?

887
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,980
Don't bother knowing it.

888
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,740
Just distribute it to everyone.

889
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,260
Everyone, finish the work well.

890
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,100
Alright.

891
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,020
Okay.

892
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm leaving now.

893
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,380
Okay.

894
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,260
Thank you.

895
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,100
Alright.

896
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,860
- Honey.
- You're back.

897
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm suffocating.

898
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,260
Hello?

899
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,140
