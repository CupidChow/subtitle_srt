Qiufang,

18
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,670
let's get a divorce.

19
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,630
What are you talking about?

20
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,830
I've thought it through.

21
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,350
This is

22
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,760
the best for you.

23
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,350
Rest a little longer.

24
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Close your eyes.

25
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,190
Good morning.

26
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,550
Let's find some time

27
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,550
to visit Weimin.

28
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,550
Even countries can break the ice,

29
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,480
and we're not mortal enemies.

30
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,110
How should we visit him?

31
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,230
Go openly and honestly.

32
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,480
His family won't welcome me.

33
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,920
Our families are sworn enemies.

34
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,740
How big can the grudge be?

35
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,480
Is it bigger than the grudge
between Yang Bailao and Huang Shiren?

36
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,480
I'm here for you.

37
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,040
For Qiufang's sake,
you should go see him.

38
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,040
You have been good friends for years.

39
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
Weimin.

40
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,960
What are you here for?

41
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,870
We came to see you.

42
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,280
You don't need to.

43
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,710
Leave.

44
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,430
- Weimin.
- Get out.

45
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Tang Weimin,

46
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,840
you've made sacrifices
for the revolution.

47
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,310
I admire you for being a real man.

48
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,640
But if you keep going like this,

49
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,670
I won't respect you.

50
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,040
You think I care about your respect?

51
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,640
Sooner or later, I'll fight you.

52
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I'll be ready anytime.

53
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,230
I can still beat you even like this.

54
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,070
Do you believe it?

55
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,070
What are you doing?

56
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,790
What are you doing?

57
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,720
What's going on?

58
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,920
Get out.

59
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,350
- Get out!
- Mom.

60
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,690
Get out.

61
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,530
Mom.

62
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760
Get out!

63
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,870
- Sit down.
- Weimin, are you okay?

64
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,720
Help him sit down.

65
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,670
Don't get angry.

66
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,040
It's not worth it to be mad
at people like that.

67
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,940
Jiali.

68
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,520
(Silence)

69
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,870
Jiali, why are you mad?

70
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,080
We're here to see the patient.

71
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,720
Why say those things to provoke him?

72
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,920
I want to provoke him.

73
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,990
I want him to snap out of it.

74
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
He just lost his foot.

75
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,190
Revolutionary soldiers
gave up their lives

76
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,960
on the battlefield,

77
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,170
but now he's acting
like he can't live without a foot.

78
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,330
I can't explain it to you.

79
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,650
What's there to explain?

80
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,950
You've got a nosebleed.
Tilt your head up.

81
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,080
Are you okay?

82
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,980
On the battlefield,

83
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,420
it wouldn't even count as an injury.

84
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
That was before.

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,870
Now you have a family.

86
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,870
Taking care of yourself
means taking care of me.

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,920
Got it.

88
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,430
I actually admire Weimin.

89
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,150
He's going against the current
and doesn't fear divorce.

90
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,080
What do you know? Don't talk nonsense.

91
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,110
Mom, this is what we call
"no pain, no gain".

92
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,280
Weimin can't stand his pride being hurt.

93
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,960
Look how superior he used to be.

94
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,080
He's a revolutionary soldier,

95
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
and he's been to Beijing.

96
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,430
But now? He's left with one foot.

97
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,550
Qiufang will have to take care of him

98
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,040
for the rest of her life.

99
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Weimin doesn't want to be pitied,

100
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,550
so divorce is the only option.

101
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,950
It's better this way.

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
They'll be both free.

103
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,960
There's an old saying:

104
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,070
Husband and wife are like birds
in the same forest,

105
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,210
but when disaster strikes,
they fly separately.

106
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,430
I don't think they'll get divorced.

107
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,550
It's their matter.

108
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,480
We don't need to worry about it.

109
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,310
One wants to divorce,

110
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,640
but the other doesn't.

111
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,720
So in the end, it might just be...

112
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,710
I won't divorce.

113
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,240
Qiufang,

114
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,710
listen to me.

115
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,400
It's not the time
of virtuous women anymore.

116
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,770
You've only been married
for a short time

117
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,880
and don't have kids.

118
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,830
A divorce doesn't mean much.

119
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,390
Besides,

120
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,000
the neighbors all know why,

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,260
and they won't gossip.

122
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,830
You can't ruin the rest of your life,

123
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,790
can you?

124
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,400
What kind of mother
advises her daughter to divorce?

125
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm just handling this

126
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,470
as an exceptional case.

127
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,520
So what do you want to do?

128
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,190
Now Weimin has a crippled leg,

129
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,280
he might not be able
to take care of himself,

130
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,640
let alone work.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,470
His family never made him
do anything before.

132
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,280
You just keep being stubborn.

133
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,150
I don't care.

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,240
It's just one missing foot.

135
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,710
What's the big deal?

136
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,400
You'll have a harder life ahead.

137
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,360
Mom,

138
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
you don't understand.

139
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,940
(Happiness)

140
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,630
Qiufang.

141
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,070
Mom, Dad.

142
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Qiufang.

143
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,070
How's Weimin?

144
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,830
I'll go see him.

145
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,530
Have you thought it through?

146
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,950
Yes.

147
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,470
Tomorrow,

148
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,260
let's go and take care of the paperwork.

149
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,530
I don't agree with the divorce.

150
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,950
I don't want to drag you down.

151
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,760
We're just legally married.

152
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,310
There's nothing else.

153
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,640
I've married you.

154
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,410
I'm not afraid of being dragged down.

155
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,070
Besides, you're not a burden to me.

156
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
My heart was never with you before,

157
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,710
and now, with one foot missing,

158
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,760
do you still want to be with me?

159
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,470
I do.

160
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,280
I don't.

161
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,710
Weimin.

162
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,710
Anyway,

163
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,360
it's my fault.

164
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,160
I don't care what you think

165
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,550
and who you love.

166
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,400
Now I'm your wife.

167
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,280
This is our fate for this life.

168
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,160
That's it.

169
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,520
What's there that you can't get over?

170
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,920
You just lost one foot.

171
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't mind.

172
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,360
You're my husband.

173
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,790
I will always respect and support you.

174
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,520
I will never leave you, no matter what.

175
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,360
Weimin,

176
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,000
let's live a good life together.

177
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,520
Do you pity me?

178
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,920
I don't pity you.

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,470
I like you.

180
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,920
I love you.

181
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,310
Listen.

182
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,790
Listen.

183
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,000
What a good woman.

184
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,590
Don't take your blessings for granted.

185
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,000
When your mom and I are gone,

186
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,430
dead,

187
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,280
she will always be our daughter-in-law.

Jiawen.

Jiawen.

193
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,520
Go tidy up that chicken at the door.

194
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,360
Okay.

195
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,750
Put it there.

196
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,030
Jiali and Jianguo have been
at the hospital for so long.

197
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,590
How come they're not back yet?

198
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,310
Mom.

199
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,950
Dad, we're back.

200
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,520
- Jiali, you're back.
- Jiali.

201
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,470
Jiali, you're back.

202
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,710
How's everything?

203
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,790
It's good.

204
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,160
- Everything's normal?
- Yes.

205
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,270
- It's great.
- Good.

206
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,000
- The doctor said everything's fine.
- Sit.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,590
- Help Jiali sit down.
- No need.

208
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,470
Dad, you even killed a chicken today?

209
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,760
Let's celebrate properly.

210
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,760
Let's drink today.

211
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,000
- Jiali.
- Sure.

212
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,790
Look at this. It cultivates the spirit.

213
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,670
Jiali, how about I sing you a song?

214
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,670
Let the nephew get some
artistic exposure too.

215
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,720
Sure.

216
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,390
Jianguo, let me do it.

217
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,550
No need, you sit. I'll do it.

218
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,630
Jiali.

219
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,900
Sit in this chair.

220
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,360
This chair is comfortable.

221
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,950
Jiahuan is so considerate.

222
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,790
Is Jiali having a baby brother?

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
A brother?

224
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,590
How could it be your brother?

225
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,760
It's your nephew.

226
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,590
Jiali will give us a nephew.

227
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,670
We won't have a brother,

228
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,000
but we'll have a nephew.

229
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,310
We don't know
if it's a boy or a girl yet.

230
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,520
- Either is good.
- Jianguo.

231
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,360
Have you decided on a name for the baby?

232
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
How to name it
without knowing its gender?

233
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,310
Just pick a name

234
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,070
that works for both a boy

235
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,070
and a girl.

236
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,790
I've thought about it.

237
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,790
How about Xiangdong?

238
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,490
- Zhang Xiangdong.
- Xiangdong.

239
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,660
That's a nice name.

240
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,720
Zhang Xiangdong.

241
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,360
Dad, I have an idea.

242
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,570
Our first child should be a He,

243
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,460
so it's He Xiangdong.

244
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,240
This can't be decided recklessly.

245
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
You must be kidding.

246
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,430
We're

247
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,160
not just having one child,

248
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
so for the first child,
no matter the gender,

249
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
we'll name it He Xiangdong.

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
For the second child,
no matter the gender,

251
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,070
it'll be named Zhang Xiangnan.

252
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,070
Then won't the third be Zhang Xiangxi?

253
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,240
The fourth would be Zhang Xiangbei.

254
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,280
Why didn't you

255
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,640
discuss this with me first?

256
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,280
I knew you'd agree,

257
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,160
so I didn't report it to you in advance.

258
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,240
You just knew

259
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,590
Dad would be happy today.

260
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,520
Look how excited he is.

261
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,670
Actually, the surname doesn't matter.

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,430
It's our child,

263
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,590
continuing our bloodline.

264
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,090
Besides,

265
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,870
it's their grandchild,
so it should be a He.

266
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,310
It's not a problem, right?

267
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,070
You must've long planned this, huh?

268
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,120
Do you remember I told you

269
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
we need to fulfill a wish
for them first?

270
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,120
Oh, you meant this?

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,070
What were you thinking?

272
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,790
Nothing.

273
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,360
What do you want to eat?

274
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,600
I'll cook it for you every day.

275
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm craving fried dough twist soup.

276
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,590
Fried dough twist soup?

277
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,880
Alright.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,790
The rain's getting heavier.

279
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,840
Mom.

280
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,040
Why hasn't Dad come back yet?

281
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,590
Someone passed along the message.

282
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,510
They said he went
to Shangyao to help them.

283
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,760
Shangyao?

284
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,240
That's far. Why go there?

285
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,120
They said the wall
of the Yao River Floodgate collapsed.

286
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,680
It injured a lot of people.

287
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,470
Some even died.

288
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,600
The year's been bad.

289
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,180
I feel like something bad
will happen this year.

290
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,270
- Mrs. Zhu.
- Meixin.

291
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,890
You don't know, right?

292
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,990
- What's wrong?
- Listen.

293
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,120
A big thing happened.

294
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,070
Mrs. Zhu,

295
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,840
you always bring bad news.

296
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,400
No, you don't know.

297
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,740
Last night,

298
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,230
there was an earthquake in Tangshan.

299
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,120
Where?

300
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,120
Tangshan, Hebei.

301
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,710
What are you going to do?

302
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,270
Going up to the hills to grab some land.

303
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,430
Hurry up.

304
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,510
They've started it.

305
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
- Okay.
- I'm going.

306
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,640
We'll go together.

307
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,710
- I'm going.
- Come on.

308
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,990
- Let's go look.
- Let's go.

309
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,840
Let's go take a look.

310
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,510
- Close the door.
- Take everything.

No more nails.

325
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
Go ask Mrs. Zhu.

326
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,510
- Okay.
- Jiali.

327
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,840
Jiali, I'm hungry.

328
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,510
Wait a moment. It's coming.

329
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,400
When are we eating?

330
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,080
Mrs. Zhu, do you have nails?

331
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
- Yes.
- Yes.

332
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,290
- Give me some.
- Over there.

333
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,560
- I'm hungry, Jiali.
- Hungry?

334
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Jiali, when can we eat?

335
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,230
- Okay, soon.
- Right.

336
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,540
Dad, the nails are here.

337
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,400
Mom,

338
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,880
I'll go back and get them some food.

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
Okay.

340
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,500
We're almost done for today, right?

341
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,560
Let's keep walking.

342
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,510
There's still treasure.

343
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,990
How about we go

344
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,560
behind Big Tang's shed and take a look?

345
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,920
That spot hasn't been dug yet.

346
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,160
Let's go.

347
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,230
What's this?

348
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,030
This notebook is nice.

349
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,950
It's probably the bride's.

350
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,840
Let me see.

351
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,670
Heart of a Young Girl.

352
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,640
He, you're back.

353
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,270
Dad.

354
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,120
Look, this is the treasure
I dug with Jiaxi.

355
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,960
Yes.

356
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,710
This little deer,

357
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,160
and my little sandbag.

358
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,430
You dug so many treasures.

359
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,160
Where did this notebook come from?

360
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,320
We picked it up.

361
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,650
Where did you pick it up?

362
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,610
Behind Tang Zhenmin's house.

363
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,460
Yes.

364
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,510
Have you looked at it?

365
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,400
There are many words I don't recognize.

366
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,770
Good thing you don't recognize them.

367
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,740
(Tang)

368
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,710
Don't tell anyone about this.

369
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,550
Got it?

370
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
Don't talk about it.

371
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,960
(Today's menu: luomo, scallion pancake,
beef noodles, beef soup)

372
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,800
Hurry up and eat.

373
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,510
Do we need this between us?

374
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,640
We still need to eat.

375
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,190
What's wrong?

376
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,430
It's nothing specific.

377
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,470
After so many years of dealing with you,

378
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,090
I know you well.

379
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,500
I know how many tricks

380
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,120
you have up your sleeve.

381
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,400
The moment you move,

382
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,190
I know what you're up to.

383
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,320
You can join the Party,

384
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,990
but you need to behave well.

385
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,470
The most important thing is

386
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,400
you have to withstand
the test of the organization.

387
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,030
Taking shortcuts?

388
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
No way.

389
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,670
If you want to take the wrong path,

390
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,030
you will be defeated.

391
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,120
You're overthinking it.

392
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,160
Tang,

393
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,990
the district is conducting
a strict investigation.

394
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,310
What do you mean?

395
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,920
I walk the right path and sit straight.

396
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,030
If people find out

397
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,640
about some things,

398
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,990
and if people see certain things,

399
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,600
it'll be a big deal.

400
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,270
What things?

401
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,400
What did you see?

402
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,400
Do you have something on me?

403
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,300
(Tang)

404
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
It's yours, right?

405
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,400
This hand-copied book

406
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,420
is a banned book.

407
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,540
(Tang)

408
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,190
Don't let anyone see it.

409
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,320
Hurry up and hide it.

410
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,870
Don't worry.

411
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,850
I'll pretend

412
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,070
I don't know.

413
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,510
Hurry, or it'll get cold.

414
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,320
Changsheng, Meixin,

415
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,460
when you read this letter,
it's as if I'm before you.

416
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,170
I've been away from Huainan
for over seven years,

417
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,510
and I think of you every moment.

418
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,960
Sadly, my sister has been ill
for a long time.

419
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,320
I've been taking care of her,

420
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,610
so she's now in good health.

421
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,800
We've relied on each other
since childhood.

422
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,490
After suffering from the war,

423
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,530
her body has been weak.

424
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,220
She's my sister.

425
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,550
It's my duty to take care of her,

426
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,260
so I can't share the joy of family
with you for now.

427
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,460
I'm sending this letter
through someone else.

428
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,320
My sister is now seriously ill in bed,

429
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,010
and I fear she won't survive long.

430
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,420
She misses Changsheng

431
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,600
and Meixin.

432
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,700
She asked me to invite you
to return home

433
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,370
to ease her longing.

434
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,630
You have to come.

435
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,300
So it seems

436
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,660
we need to go back to Jiangdu.

437
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,480
I'm worried. If we leave,

438
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,080
what will Jiali do?

439
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,500
Jianguo is so busy right now.

440
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,600
Who will take care of you?

441
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,230
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

442
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,230
I can take care of myself.

443
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,190
Besides, we have Jiawen and Jiayi.

444
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,230
What about meals?

445
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,550
Three meals a day,

446
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,730
and so many mouths to feed.

447
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,840
I can cook.

448
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,460
You can cook?

449
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,710
Jiawen and Jiayi can manage too.

450
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,470
Dad, Mom, don't worry. Go ahead.

451
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,000
Alright.

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,840
Then I'll give you living expenses,

453
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,430
food coupons, and vegetable coupons.

454
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,440
Jiawen,

455
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,470
stick close to Jiali.

456
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,960
Got it.

457
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,950
Jiayi, Jiahuan,

458
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,030
you'll buy groceries and cook.

459
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,750
Xiaoling, Jiaxi,

460
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,640
be good and help out.

461
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,540
Don't wander off.

462
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,410
Got it?

463
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,260
Yes.

464
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,710
Every day, check back at home.

465
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,190
Come back before dark.

466
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,520
Got it.

467
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,030
Jiawen, you're responsible

468
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,430
for making sure everyone's in bed
by night.

469
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,270
Okay?

470
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,840
You all have to listen to Jiali.

471
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,430
Don't make her angry.

472
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,510
If anything happens to Jiali,

473
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,430
I'll make you regret it when I get back.

474
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,600
Jiali, you're full?

475
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,430
Jiayi, Jiahuan,

476
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,670
what's wrong with you?

477
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,470
It's always radishes and cabbage.

478
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,270
Jiali needs nutrition right now.

479
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,910
Is it because there's no money?

480
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,620
We don't mind.

481
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,750
Don't worry.

482
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,360
Who doesn't care about Jiali?

483
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,010
We're at this point.

484
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,120
Everything should go to Jiali first.

485
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,200
What are you cooking?

486
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,600
Fish and meat for Jiali.

487
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,800
Why are you so happy?

488
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,800
Because I can do something for Jiali.

489
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,590
Don't run.

490
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,990
You can't catch me!

491
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,590
Candles.

492
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,870
There are matches.

493
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,530
We can have fun lighting candles.

494
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,510
Hurry up.

495
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,640
Light one.

496
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
This is fun.

497
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,880
What's that smell?

498
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,240
It smells like meat.

499
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,710
I saw Jiayi come back with meat earlier,

500
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,920
so we'll have meat tonight.

501
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,270
Jiayi.

502
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,190
Jiali, we have
fish and vegetables tonight

503
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,320
to nourish you.

504
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,840
You've worked hard.

505
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,600
- It's fine.
- Let's take the food to the shed.

506
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,270
Jiali, you don't need to move.

507
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,190
We can carry

508
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,180
these dishes.

509
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,750
Something's wrong!

510
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
It's on fire!

511
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,580
It's on fire!

512
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,190
- It's on fire!
- Where's the fire?

513
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,230
Our shed

514
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,720
is on fire!

515
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,030
Oh, my.

516
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,870
Let's go see it.

517
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,720
Let's go.

518
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,160
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

519
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,300
Less water. Pour it first.

520
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,270
Pour water on the fire.

521
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,430
That's too much to pour.

522
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,400
Pour over there.

523
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,030
Pour it on the fire.

524
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,400
On the fire!

525
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,030
Careful!

526
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,470
- Hurry up!
- This place has the biggest fire.

527
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,920
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

528
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,190
The fire is the biggest over there.

529
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,030
Hurry up!

530
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,190
How do we explain it to Dad and Mom?

531
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,840
Who was in the shed this afternoon?

532
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,750
I was out.

533
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,740
Qiulin can vouch for me.

534
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,980
What about Xiaoling and Jiaxi?

535
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,530
I was digging radishes with Xiaoling.

536
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,300
Yes, I was digging radishes with Jiaxi.

537
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,670
Did the shed catch fire by itself?

538
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,310
It wasn't me!

539
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,510
Don't move. Stay here.

540
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,270
Jiali, I'll go too.

541
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,270
Hurry, hurry!

542
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,810
All the furniture
in the quake-proof shed

543
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,030
was burned up in one fire.

544
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,640
I think we should call the police.

545
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,750
It's too late now. Why call the police?

546
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,500
But we still need to know

547
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,270
whether it was accidental
or intentional.

548
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,670
Arson is a crime.

549
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,800
We can't let any bad person
get away with it.

550
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,960
Right.

551
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,360
Xiaoling, Jiaxi,

552
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,160
before we call the police,

553
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,470
you two tell us.

554
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,840
Did you play with fire in the shed?

555
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,600
She lit the candle.

556
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,110
She struck the match.

557
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,190
That's the basic story.

558
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,840
Jianguo and I didn't want you to worry,

559
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,190
so we didn't send you a telegram.

560
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,880
We're glad you're all safe.

561
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,990
The district gave us some furniture,

562
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,560
and Jianguo took care of the rest.

563
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,360
Let's go home.

564
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,060
(February 1977)

565
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,120
Just postpone the rural trip if you can

566
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,320
to see how things go.

567
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,750
I want to find a job.

568
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,190
There are three options:

569
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,360
be a worker, a cadre, or an officer.

570
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,030
Jiawen, hurry and call the nurse.

571
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,470
I feel something's wrong.

572
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,510
Okay.

573
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,980
(Labor Ward)

574
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,990
When your mom gave birth to Jiali,

575
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,950
I was as nervous as you.

576
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,900
(Operating)

577
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,920
Jiali is healthy

578
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,760
and very lucky.

579
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,880
She will get through this.

580
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,960
Dad,

581
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,710
I heard people say

582
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,920
giving birth is a near-death experience.

583
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,510
Yes, that's what the old saying goes.

584
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,160
Giving birth is really tough for women.

585
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,360
But now, the conditions are much better.

586
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,430
When Jiali was born,

587
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,880
there was nothing like today.

588
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,020
We didn't go to the hospital.

589
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,470
Back then, women gave birth at home

590
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,710
with a midwife.

591
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,960
Jianguo,

592
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,070
I've long had a question for you.

593
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,680
Tell me the truth.

594
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,400
If Jiali gave birth

595
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,070
to a girl,

596
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,920
what would you do?

597
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,090
I don't care whether it's a boy
or a girl,

598
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,990
as long as Jiali is fine.

599
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,910
Good.

600
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,210
My daughter picked the right man.

601
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,300
(Operating)

602
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,550
He Jiali's family?

603
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,640
Yes.

604
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,520
It's a boy.

605
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,310
Doctor.

606
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,950
Doctor,

607
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,110
how is the mother?

608
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
They're both safe.

609
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
Thank you.

610
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,920
They're both safe.

611
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,150
He looks just like you.

612
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,400
I think he looks like Jianguo,

613
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,160
doesn't he?

614
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,510
He sounds so loud.

615
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,760
Changsheng,

616
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,330
give him a name.

617
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,990
His father is here.

618
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,880
Well...

619
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,050
What will he be called?

620
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,360
We agreed on this, right?

621
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,110
He'll be He Xiangdong.

622
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,280
He Xiangdong.

623
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,400
- Jianguo.
- He Xiangdong.

624
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,550
That was not serious.

625
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,320
Are you really going to let him be a He?

626
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,990
Dad, Jiali and I have long planned this.

627
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
The first child will be a He.

628
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,920
That's the official name.

629
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,510
We still need a nickname.

630
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,030
Dad,

631
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
you name him.

632
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
Alright, I'll think of one.

633
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,920
She's your mom.

634
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,070
What should it be?

635
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,680
The Chinese New Year is coming.

636
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,280
How about Xiaonian?

637
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
Xiaonian.

638
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,110
- Good.
- Good.

639
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,950
Alright.

640
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,950
Xiaonian.

641
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,200
- Xiaonian.
- Xiaonian.

642
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,320
Xiaonian.

643
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,070
Do you know what will he call you?

644
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,110
No.

645
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,240
Aunt.

646
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,470
You're all aunts now. Do you know that?

647
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,630
That's great! We're aunts now!

648
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,590
Right!

649
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,880
- Xiaonian.
- Xiaonian.

650
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,990
Look at her hair.

651
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,150
It's so thick.

652
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,320
She takes it after Weimin.

653
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,200
Good girl, you've worked hard.

654
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,360
Mom, it's nothing.

655
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,190
Mrs. Tang, you're too polite.

656
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,990
Well, being a woman,

657
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,610
this is bound to happen.

658
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,840
Look at that little nose.

659
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,630
She takes it after Qiufang.

660
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,150
Her face is just like Qiufang.

661
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,110
But I think the nose is big.

662
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,720
It really looks like Weimin's, right?

663
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,080
(Chairman Mao's Quotes)

664
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,700
(Be resolute, fear no sacrifice)

665
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,860
(Blessings)

666
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,630
I think you're nowhere near Jianguo.

667
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,030
He's organized and thorough

668
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,990
in his work.

669
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,950
He's much better

670
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,150
- than you.
- No, no.

671
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,510
You flatter me.

672
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,720
- Jianguo.
- Dad.

673
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,680
When I'm not around,

674
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,110
you're in charge of the family.

675
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,310
You make the decisions.

676
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,180
Well...

677
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,040
This is exaggerated.

678
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,020
Jianguo will take over.

679
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,880
No, no, Dad.

680
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
This is exaggerated.

681
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,470
- Jiawen, listen.
- Okay.

682
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,150
When I'm gone,

683
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,030
everything, big or small,

684
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,510
will be decided by Jianguo.

685
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,320
Jianguo is the one in charge.

686
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,510
Alright, let's drink.

687
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,470
Stop drinking.

688
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,950
Dad, you're drunk again.

689
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,280
You can't let your mom

690
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,840
decide anything.

691
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,760
If your mom were in charge,

692
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,630
this family would be a mess.

693
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,070
Would you dare say that in front of Mom?

694
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,630
You call her over.

695
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,570
I'll say it to her face.

696
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,840
Is he hungry?

697
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,250
Yes, Xiaonian's hungry.

698
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,720
- Drink less.
- Alright.

699
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,740
- Come on.
- Mom said no drinking.

700
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,510
- Let's stop.
- Xiaonian might be hungry.

701
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,730
- OK, let's stop.
- Go ahead.

702
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,360
Hungry? Here, eat something warm.

703
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,570
It's cold. Don't eat that.

704
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,460
This is fun!

705
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,280
So much fun!

706
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,840
Be careful, everyone.

707
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,680
Got it.

708
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,630
Do you dare make a loud noise?

709
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,630
- No.
- I dare not.

710
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,470
Let me show you
how to make a loud noise.

711
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,800
- Go.
- Come here.

712
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,070
Jiahuan, be careful.

713
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,950
Got it.

714
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,720
Jiahuan!

715
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,910
Jiahuan!

716
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,260
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

717
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,430
Dad, Mom, Jiahuan got blown up!

718
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,430
Time to eat!

719
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,800
Xiaoling, go eat.

720
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,800
Got it, Jiali.

721
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,200
You don't want to eat now?

722
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,690
I'll bring the food to you?

723
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,630
Still won't come out?

724
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,330
Still crying.

725
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,550
She needs more time.

726
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,150
Will it leave a scar?

727
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,150
I looked. It's much better.

728
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,840
It's not that serious.

729
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,550
She is never that pretty anyway,

730
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,200
and she has a bad temper.

731
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,950
What if the scar stays?

732
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,360
How will she get married later?

733
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,320
There's always a solution.

734
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,950
Is it ready?

735
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,990
I'll bring it to her.

736
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,830
It's ready.

737
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,650
Use a little sesame oil.

738
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
Don't add soy sauce

739
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,360
to her dish.

740
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,760
Be careful. It's hot.

741
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,360
Hurry up.

742
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,950
School starts today. Don't be late.

743
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,360
- Jiali, we're going to school.
- OK.

744
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,110
Jiali, I'll go check the job postings.

745
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:27,950
Okay, you go.

746
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,320
Jiahuan, are you going or not?

747
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm not going.

748
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,830
As you wish.

749
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Jiahuan, your scar is much better now.

750
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,420
You should go.

751
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,260
I still won't go.

752
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,020
Are you going to hide here
for the rest of your life?

753
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,100
Dad won't allow it.

754
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,060
You still have to go to school and work.

755
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,900
Just leave me alone.

756
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,020
(Zhang Qiulin)
Jiali, has Jiahuan left?

757
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,140
That's it. Come here.

758
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,420
You came at the right moment.

759
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,340
She hasn't left yet. Go talk to her.

760
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,260
Look at this.

761
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,580
What's this?

762
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,300
I made it myself.

763
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,100
It's just a scar under your eye.

764
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,940
You can wear it. After the scar fades,

765
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,140
it'll be like before.

766
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,380
I'm afraid people
will laugh at me with this.

767
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,780
I won't wear it. It looks bad.

768
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,260
This is so cute.

769
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,940
I'll wear it too.

770
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,980
We'll be a united front.

771
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,220
Look, it's so cute.

772
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,300
You look nice too.
