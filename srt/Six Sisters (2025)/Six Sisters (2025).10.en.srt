No, no.

16
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,860
Let me tell you.

17
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,170
Your hip needs

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,140
to be pushed up against this bar.

19
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,470
Try it.

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,710
It's easier this way.

21
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,550
Right, right.

22
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,430
In a moment, you go prepare

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,170
six poached eggs.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,720
Looks like your dad really likes Weiguo.

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,440
Jianguo.

26
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,120
Have there been any updates on my work?

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,500
Don't worry.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,480
Your sister and I
are keeping an eye on it.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
We'll let you know
as soon as there's news.

(Family Tradition: Kind)

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,580
Coming.

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,100
What time is it?
Why haven't they come yet?

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,400
- Don't rush.
- Mom.

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,680
Mom.

35
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,650
- Jiawen is here.
- They're here.

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,880
Hurry. They're here.

37
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,200
- Jiawen, come in.
- Mrs. Chen.

38
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,350
Come on, come here.

39
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,230
Jiawen's gifts.

40
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,320
Mrs. Chen, this is a gift from my mom.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,580
(Homemade)
Thank you.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,000
Jiawen, come here.

43
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,000
Sit here.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Come on.

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,880
Have a seat.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,210
We must be late.

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,560
- No, no.
- No.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,340
Weiguo,

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
don't just smile there.

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,370
Introduce us.

51
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,710
Oh, right.

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,190
This is my older brother.

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,950
Thank you. Hello.

54
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,790
Hello, hello.

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,660
My sister-in-law.

56
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,180
My eldest sister.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,160
Hello.

59
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,390
My little sister.

60
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,260
Hello.

61
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,330
And our big treasure here.

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,150
- She's Niu.
- Niu.

63
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,990
Hello.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Aunt, you're really pretty.

65
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,000
Wow, so sweet.

66
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,600
Let me properly introduce her.

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,440
He Jiawen,

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,760
my girlfriend.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
- Got it.
- Really pretty.

70
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,160
Let me say a few words.

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,400
Today, Jiawen is here
for the first time.

72
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,290
Let's give her a warm welcome, right?

73
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,220
- Right.
- Welcome.

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,060
Can you drink?

75
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,140
- Sure.
- Come on.

76
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,760
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
Alright.

78
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,440
I'm so happy today. I'll drink first.

79
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,650
Mom, drink slowly.

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,020
Now, let's drink. Cheers.

81
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,250
Come on, have some food.

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,900
Here.

83
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,830
Try the chicken soup my mom made.

84
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,670
OK.

85
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,990
Jiawen,

86
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,430
don't worry.

87
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,720
If you and Weiguo end up together,

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,340
I've already prepared

89
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
the house,

90
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,600
the furniture,

91
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,800
and the betrothal gifts.

92
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,900
Thank you, Mom.

93
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,310
Mrs. Chen,

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,800
the last time you gave us
such an expensive gift.

95
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,160
My mom's been worried
about how to return it.

96
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,600
It's just a little thing.
I'm glad you like it.

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,670
No need for any returns.

98
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,840
Don't stand on ceremony.

99
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,040
Come on, eat up. Have some soup.

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,090
Thank you.

101
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,240
Well,

102
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,240
the leather is quite good this year.

103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,600
Weiguo is a fine young man.

104
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,690
He's strong,

105
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,800
sharp-eyed,

106
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,210
and hardworking.

107
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,400
Jiawen really knows how to pick a man.

108
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,890
Who are these leather items for?

109
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,450
You want them?

110
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,180
Well, they're for gifts.

111
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,840
I have to find someone

112
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,730
to take care of Jiayi's job.

113
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,360
It's been so many years.

114
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,580
We've seen a lot of good leather,

115
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,890
but all of it's been given away.

116
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,450
We should keep a little at home, right?

117
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,210
Any progress?

118
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,840
The Art Factory.

119
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,160
Sit.

120
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,460
This year, we'll start
with practicing lines.

121
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,240
Your hand must be steady.

122
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,190
Once you can trace the lines,

123
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,280
we'll start with coloring.

124
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,540
OK.

125
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,040
It's alright. Try again.

126
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,220
Jiayi.

127
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,670
What are you doing?

128
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,650
Nothing.

129
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm checking if there are cockroaches.

130
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,890
Are you taking me to buy shaobing?

131
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,580
Of course.

132
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,510
No problem.

133
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,310
You've suddenly become generous.

134
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,210
Well, I'm your sister after all.

135
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,310
Let's go.

136
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,430
The salary

137
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,910
Jiayi submitted for the first month

138
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,360
is wrong.

139
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,330
How do you know?

140
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,090
Mrs. Zhang's daughter

141
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,920
next door has the same job,

142
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,040
but she earns more than this number.

143
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,920
We'll talk about it next month.

144
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,350
If everyone were like you,

145
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,210
the national treasury
would've been empty.

146
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,170
Now, five of us are earning money.

147
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,080
Life is much better than before.

148
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,800
Shouldn't we loosen up for the kids?

149
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,970
But we can't start with Jiayi.

150
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,380
If the beam isn't straight,
the rest will be crooked.

151
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,690
Jiayi has always been strong-willed

152
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,780
but has never been able
to stand on her own.

153
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,010
Now,

154
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,080
she can finally earn money.

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,210
I bet the novelty hasn't worn off yet.

156
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,530
Let her enjoy it for a while.

157
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,110
We'll see how it goes in a while.

158
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,700
(Special Repair)

159
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,380
(Autumn 1982,
Hengdeli Watch and Eyewear Company)

160
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,880
Look, who's this big star?

161
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,460
So pretty.

162
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,520
It's better to come at the right time.

163
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
You bought your glasses
at the right moment.

164
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,940
What's this?

165
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,930
A camera.

166
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,840
I've loaded the film.

167
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,980
How many shots can we take?

168
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,790
You can take as many as you like.

169
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,690
Really?

170
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,000
The background is good.

171
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,240
Alright, go ahead.

172
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,810
Good.

173
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,950
Take another one.

174
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,670
Come on.

175
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,950
Good.

176
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,090
Take another one.

177
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,810
OK, one more.

178
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,740
Good.

179
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,310
Jiayi,

180
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,720
we've never taken a photo together.

181
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,290
No one can take one for us.

182
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,290
He can help us.

183
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,790
Alright.

184
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,710
Let's take one.

185
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,740
Sir,

186
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,000
can you do me a favor and take a photo?

187
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,400
I don't know how to do it.

188
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,890
- It's okay. I'll teach you.
- OK.

189
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,720
Look. After you finish the film,
just press this button.

190
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,640
Just frame us in the shot.

191
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,730
Got it.

192
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,570
Thanks.

193
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,360
Say "One, two, three".

194
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,210
One, two, three.

195
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,410
Alright, one more.

196
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,120
One, two, three.

197
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,190
Come on. Let me hold you up to see.

198
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,240
- Take one more.
- OK.

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,340
The background is the lake.

200
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,530
This lake is beautiful.

201
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,450
- Come on.
- Come on.

202
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,580
Get ready.

203
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,740
Jiayi,

204
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,310
what are you doing?

205
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,330
Put your hands down.

206
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,070
This...

207
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,690
- Young man.
- It's Jiali, right?

208
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,860
Jiali.

209
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,980
Jiali.

210
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,720
We're taking a photo.

211
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,600
People take it step by step.

212
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,550
But you...

213
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,540
You ran.

214
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,530
Jiali, you misunderstood us.

215
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,240
We were at that eyewear store...

216
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,190
Misunderstood?

217
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,190
Why was his arm around your shoulders?

218
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,950
I...

219
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,740
Where did you get the money to buy this?

220
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,580
Jiayi.

221
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,460
Jiayi.

222
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,260
Jiayi.

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,670
Jiayi, what are you doing?

224
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,520
Why are you avoiding me?

225
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,500
Jiayi,

226
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,090
we're still friends, right?

227
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,600
Just ordinary friends.

228
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,790
Alright.

229
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,840
Ordinary friends are fine.

230
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,880
Jiayi.

231
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,540
(Ouyang)

232
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,970
What are you doing?

233
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,300
I'm not doing anything.

234
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,530
Jiayi, let's not go any further.

235
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,700
I know there's

236
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,330
a really good restaurant there.

237
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,690
Let's go eat.

238
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,090
Do you know him?

239
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,090
- No.
- Liar.

240
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,160
He's just a sunflower seed seller.

241
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,450
How could I know him?

242
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,380
Jiayi.

243
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,980
Jiayi.

244
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,480
He's my dad.

245
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,930
I want sunflower seeds.

246
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,640
Why are you hiding from your dad?

247
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm afraid you wouldn't like him.

248
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
You're such an outstanding beauty.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,840
Ouyang Bao,

250
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,290
is this how you see me in your heart?

251
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,760
Your dad...

252
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,000
No matter how simple,
he's still your dad.

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,480
Without him, where would you be?

254
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,440
If you don't acknowledge your dad,
I won't acknowledge you.

255
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,070
Don't.

256
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,580
Dad,

257
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,290
why aren't you resting today?

258
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,340
Yeah.

259
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,600
There's a new movie today.

260
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,170
Hello, sir.

261
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,620
Hello.

262
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,640
Let me introduce you.

263
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,240
This is Jiayi,

264
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,880
the girl I've been telling you about.

265
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
The really good one.

266
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,980
Miss,

267
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,720
thank you.

268
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,190
What are you thanking me for?

269
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,090
You've saved my son.

270
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,600
Ever since he met you,

271
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,810
he's improved

272
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,580
and grown up.

273
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,410
You've saved him.

274
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,250
Sir,

275
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,720
I'm not that capable.

276
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,810
If he's offended you,
please forgive him.

277
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,240
As the saying goes,

278
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,640
even a toad has times when it's useful.

279
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,450
With the right guidance,

280
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,330
he'll be a great person.

281
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,600
Don't worry, sir.

282
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,290
Ouyang is a good man.

283
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,330
You raised a good son.

284
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,550
Well, I'll go to work now.

285
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,050
Dad, you go ahead.

286
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,520
Eat some sunflower seeds.

287
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,160
Take some, take some.

288
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,090
It's alright. Take some.

289
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,120
Alright, alright.

290
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,770
Take some.

291
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,090
Dad, I don't want any sunflower seeds.

292
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,430
Alright.

293
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,090
Take more, take more.

294
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,590
- OK.
- Thank you.

295
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,450
I'm going to work.

296
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,550
Goodbye.

297
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,210
Sunflower seeds!

298
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,450
Sunflower seeds!

299
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,340
My dad's roasted sunflower seeds
are delicious. Try them.

300
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,780
(Autumn Housing Allocation
for Employees)

301
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,410
Is there any first-floor left?

302
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,050
Who hasn't chosen yet?

303
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,220
Where's He?

304
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,690
I'm here.

305
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,520
- Here.
- Which unit do you want?

306
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,760
Is there still a first-floor one?

307
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,280
First floor?

308
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,820
There are only three first-floor units.

309
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,670
Now, Tang and Zhu have both

310
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,470
- chosen one.
- There's only one left.

311
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,450
I'll take this one.

312
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,040
- OK.
- He, let me have it.

313
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,290
I'm afraid of climbing stairs.

314
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,470
I don't mind

315
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,520
which floor I live on.

316
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,640
But my mom's coming

317
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,830
to live here soon.

318
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,550
She can't walk very well.

319
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,690
It'll be inconvenient for her
to climb the stairs.

320
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,190
Sorry about that.

321
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,460
He will live on the first floor.

322
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,300
First floor.

323
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,080
Third floor, third floor.

324
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,180
- I want the third floor.
- I want the third floor.

325
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,610
Third floor, third floor.

326
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,720
Any third-floor units?

327
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,600
Just this one.

328
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,840
Look at how excited you are.

329
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,330
- How is it?
- A little excited.

330
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,190
When can we get the keys?

331
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,290
I want to go inside.

332
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,950
Why rush? The house is assigned to you.

333
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,120
It's not like it'll run away.

334
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,830
In a couple of days, you'll have it.

335
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,330
Look, that's a bedroom over there,

336
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,120
and this is the living room.

337
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,100
Right.

338
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,880
- I'll draw it for you.
- Where's the kitchen?

339
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,480
Here, look.

340
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,880
This is our house.

341
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,810
This is the entrance door.

342
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,790
When you come in, on the right side

343
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,130
is the bathroom.

344
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,260
Look, next to the bathroom

345
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,590
is a room facing the living room.

346
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,200
- I don't understand.
- This side is...

347
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,040
That is

348
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,330
a bedroom too.

349
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,740
It has three bedrooms
and one living room.

350
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,190
So many rooms.

351
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,300
How should we divide them
among the girls?

352
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,430
That's just

353
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,070
up to you.

354
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,490
You can arrange it however you want.

355
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,410
Finally, this day has come.

356
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,720
There's a yard at the front and back.

357
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,040
I'll plant roses
and jasmine flowers there.

358
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,080
Jasmine smells so good.

359
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,880
I'll also plant sunflowers.

360
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,190
Stop dreaming.

361
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,710
Mom said the yard should be
for raising chickens.

362
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,800
Will the outhouse be inside the house?

363
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,130
So we don't have to go out?

364
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,200
Look at you.

365
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,270
It's not a sitting toilet.

366
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,240
It's a squat toilet.

367
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,210
The main issue is...

368
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,650
How are we going to live there?

369
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll say it first.

370
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
I'll share a room with Jiawen.

371
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,430
Why? I'll share a room with Jiawen.

372
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,410
You can live with her.

373
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,190
We're born with an order.

374
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,340
It's all settled.

375
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,750
I'm naturally close to Jiawen.

376
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,080
Why are you jumping ahead of me?

377
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,130
So what?

378
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,850
Jiawen, who do you want to live with?

379
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,700
I'm fine with anyone.

380
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,100
Anyone can live with me.

381
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,300
Don't say that.

382
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,620
You have to make a decision.

383
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,460
Jiawen.

384
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,540
I need to tell you
an important fact in advance.

385
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,620
Jiahuan's feet stink.

386
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,540
That's slander.

387
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
How about this?

388
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,060
You stop fighting.

389
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,260
I'll live with Jiawen.

390
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,740
- You're the 5th.
- You're the 5th.

391
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,740
Anyway, Jiawen's bed

392
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,980
is already mine.

393
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm closest to Jiawen.

394
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,340
Oh, really?
Everyone knows your little thoughts.

395
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,260
You just want to wait
until Jiawen gets married

396
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,960
and you'll have a big room
all to yourself.

397
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
What a dirty thought.

398
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,380
I've never thought that.

399
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,540
Then why are you explaining?

400
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,460
What am I explaining?

401
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,300
Why are you arguing?

402
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,740
Dad.

403
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,340
I can hear you all the way from here.

404
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,420
Dad, they're discussing

405
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,980
how to arrange the rooms.

406
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,740
That's right, Dad.

407
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,100
You have to make the decision.

408
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,300
Ask your mom about it.

409
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,460
Let her arrange it.

410
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
Mom doesn't care.

411
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,220
Then how do you want to live?

412
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,620
I'll live with Jiawen.

413
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,340
No, I'll live with Jiawen.

414
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,740
We both love reading, right, Jiawen?

415
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,160
I won't live with Jiahuan.

416
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,260
Who wants to live with you?

417
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,720
- Who wants to live with you?
- Who wants to live with you?

418
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,220
Look, look.

419
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,060
This is why you can't discuss things.

420
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,860
It always gets messy.

421
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,900
What are you saying?

422
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,780
We're all family.

423
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,820
Are you enemies?

424
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,100
How about this?

425
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,740
Jiawen and Jiayi share a room;

426
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,740
Jiahuan and Xiaoling share a room.

427
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,620
Then we'll put the bunk beds

428
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,780
in Jiahuan and Xiaoling's room.

429
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,580
Who sleeps on the top bunk?

430
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,780
You sleep on the bottom.

431
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,220
Why? I want to sleep on the top.

432
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,020
I'm afraid she'll dirty my bed.

433
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,580
How about this?

434
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,580
We'll make you a big room on your own.

435
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,060
You'll sleep on one bed by yourself.

436
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,020
From now on, you'll be in charge.

437
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,540
Why are you laughing?

438
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,380
(Moving Celebration)

439
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,500
(Unit 2)

440
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,340
- Done.
- Great.

441
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,700
Alright.

442
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,740
Our new house.

443
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,820
Come down.

444
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,140
- Let's go inside.
- Lead the way.

445
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,220
Let's go.

446
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,140
(Unit 2, Moving Celebration)

447
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,220
(Harmony)

448
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,220
You've started.

449
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,700
- Weiguo.
- Try the Chen-style braised pork.

450
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,620
Good job, Weiguo.

451
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,980
- It's nothing.
- You surprised me.

452
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,700
I don't know if it suits your taste.

453
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,690
- Sit.
- Weiguo.

454
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Jiawen is going to have a good life.

455
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,020
Mom.

456
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,620
Jiawen has always known

457
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,100
how to take advantage of situations.

458
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,100
Good job.

459
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,180
Hurry.

460
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,900
Eat your meal.

461
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
- It's okay.
- What do you mean?

462
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,140
Eat more.

463
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,340
Jiawen is the most sensible one.

464
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,980
She knows how to care for others.

465
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,340
Someone like her

466
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,620
will have a blessed future, right?

467
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,860
You all

468
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,860
should learn from Jiawen.

469
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,740
- Weiguo.
- I'll drink to you.

470
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,780
I think the girls
are all quite sensible.

471
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,660
Yes, yes.

472
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,220
Weiguo.

473
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,300
Welcome.

474
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,380
Thank you, Jiali.

475
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,300
Come on.

476
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
- Jianguo.
- Jiawen.

477
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,820
Jiali.

478
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,800
I wish you both the best.

479
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,980
You drink it yourself.

480
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,260
What do you think?

481
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,020
What do you mean?

482
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,300
How did I do today?

483
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,060
Honestly,

484
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,740
I was so nervous today.

485
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,540
I didn't notice you were nervous.

486
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,540
You look like an old hand.

487
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,340
An old hand?

488
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,780
My hand was sweating.

489
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,380
I was worried
I'd say something inappropriate.

490
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,540
You were acting.

491
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,540
It wasn't acting.

492
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,300
I just acted naturally.

493
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,740
You know me.

494
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,980
I'm absolutely true to myself.

495
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,700
Jiawen,

496
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,020
I've made up my mind.

497
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,620
If we're together,

498
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,300
your parents will be my parents,

499
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,860
and your sisters will be my sisters.

500
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,060
I'll treat them with all sincerity.

501
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,060
Go back now.

502
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,540
Jiawen,

503
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,340
do you think we can

504
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,380
take this relationship a step further?

505
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,220
I'll go back now.

506
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,020
Go back.

507
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,020
I don't know

508
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,740
the customs in your hometown,

509
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,100
so I went ahead and prepared some.

510
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,060
Consider it

511
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,940
as a proper betrothal gift for my son.

512
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,780
I hope you can grant their wish

513
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,500
and wish them a long

514
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,300
and happy marriage.

515
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,780
You...

516
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,780
You're too kind.

517
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Also,

518
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,160
if you find

519
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,260
anything lacking,

520
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,340
just let me know.

521
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,660
I'll fix it right away.

522
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,140
Let's pick a date then.

523
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,140
Right.

524
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,620
You and Jiawen's dad can discuss it.

525
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,740
It would be best

526
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,460
to pick a lucky day.

527
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,620
It must be a lucky day.

528
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,080
How many times have you counted?

529
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,540
It's a thousand.

530
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,740
You can count a hundred more times,

531
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,780
and it's still a thousand.

532
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
A thousand.

533
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,860
I didn't expect

534
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,500
they'd give so much.

535
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,540
This isn't much.

536
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,740
I gave birth to her.
We've raised her for so many years.

537
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,980
What's more,

538
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,100
we have to prepare a dowry.

539
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,340
Are you marrying off a daughter

540
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,700
or selling one?

541
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,140
The amount they give

542
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,300
represents the respect
they have for Jiawen.

543
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,940
So what?

544
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,740
Our efforts aren't worth anything?

545
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,620
You...

546
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,540
I think you're only thinking
about the money.

547
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,500
You don't want it?

548
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,540
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

549
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,060
What about the dowry?

550
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,860
What about it? Isn't it ready?

551
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,880
They gave a thousand.

552
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,820
The dowry we prepared

553
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,540
isn't decent enough.

554
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,820
Then why did you just accept it?

555
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,980
When she gave it to me,

556
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,380
how did I know it was so much?

557
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,660
When you hold it,
you can feel the weight.

558
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,540
You feel it?

559
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,100
Oh, no.

560
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,020
Now what do we do?

561
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,820
I think

562
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,060
we have to give them a big item.

563
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,940
What big item?

564
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,820
How about buying a TV?

565
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,060
We don't even have one.

566
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
Let's buy it.

567
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,340
Let's buy two.

568
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,100
You decide, really.

569
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,020
Let's buy it.

570
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,260
Really?

571
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,820
Our family is getting a TV soon.

572
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,900
(In Service)

573
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,140
Mom, can I open a savings account?

574
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,620
What do you need that for?

575
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,820
I want to earn interest.

576
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,380
Do you have money for that?

577
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,100
Yes, I have my New Year's money.

578
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,460
Clever.

579
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,580
Alright, I'll have Jiawen teach you.

580
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,220
How can I work at the Savings Office?

581
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,580
Here?

582
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,780
You'll probably need
to be an accountant.

583
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,300
So, how do I become an accountant?

584
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,820
Learn arithmetic.

585
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,340
I can do arithmetic.

586
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,660
What's seven plus seven?

587
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,860
14. That's too easy.

588
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,620
OK, let's try something harder.

589
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,540
109 plus 283.

590
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,700
392.

591
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,540
Not bad, girl.

592
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,900
Let's do more.

593
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,700
56 times 63.

594
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,060
3528.

595
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,380
86 times 105.

596
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,580
9030.

597
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,940
9030.

598
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,660
You're good, He Jiahuan.

599
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,380
Didn't realize you're a genius.

600
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,460
You'll definitely be an accountant.

601
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,580
What are you doing?

602
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,300
Studying.

603
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,720
Did the teacher ask you to do this?

604
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,780
I'm studying myself.

605
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,940
I have to learn this in college.

606
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,820
You're going to college?

607
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,860
Aren't you?

608
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,540
Not sure, maybe I'll work first.

609
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,180
The Gaokao is the best way out

610
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,220
for people like us.

611
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,540
I won't. I want to be an accountant.

612
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,620
There's an accounting major in college.

613
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,500
Really?

614
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,300
Why would I lie to you?

615
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,700
This is for you.

616
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,940
This is the Qiulin brand radio,

617
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,820
the first one in the entire universe.

618
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
Jiawen, look.

619
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,780
These are all the gifts
from your in-laws.

620
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,300
You should keep them.

621
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,500
Mom, these are for you and Dad.

622
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,100
- I can't take it.
- We don't keep them.

623
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,060
All for you.

624
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,500
After you marry Weiguo,

625
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,660
the family expenses will only increase.

626
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,340
You should keep something for yourself.

627
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,300
Look at this.

628
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,700
Your in-laws said these bracelets

629
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,220
were from the Palace
of the Qing Dynasty.

630
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,620
They're worth something.

631
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,500
Mom.

632
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,100
Weiguo is a good child.

633
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,540
I'm at ease

634
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
with you marrying him.

635
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,700
Live well.

636
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,340
Let's talk about it.

637
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,140
How much is everyone

638
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,860
preparing for Weiguo's wedding?

639
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,980
Kesi, you go first.

640
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,340
Mom,

641
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,100
simple and frugal is a fine tradition.

642
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,740
When we got married...

643
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,940
Just tell me.

644
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,540
300.

645
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,540
Not enough.

646
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,580
500.

647
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,220
Well.

648
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,020
We'll give 500,

649
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,020
like Kesi.

650
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,220
You have kids,
so you'll need more money.

651
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,100
300.

652
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,100
Mom, how much should I give?

653
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,020
300.

654
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,740
That's settled.

655
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,580
You may leave.

656
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,220
Be careful with family relations.

657
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,540
Mom has told me.

658
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,380
Your future brother-in-law and his wife

659
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,860
aren't easy to deal with.

660
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,620
Your future sister-in-law
and her husband

661
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,240
are also living at home
with two nephews.

662
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,060
It's all temporary.

663
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,820
Once Weiguo gets a house,

664
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,780
we'll move out and live alone.

665
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,440
How many years have

666
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,160
Weiguo's brother
and his wife been married?

667
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,380
They haven't had any kids?

668
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,980
Maybe it's just fate.

669
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,380
We can't force it.

670
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,580
When you marry him,

671
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,160
you'll have a son and a daughter,

672
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,700
and your mother-in-law will like you.

673
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,540
How will they feel?

674
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,140
What will they think of you then?

675
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,340
That's how important being fair is.

676
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,860
But I can't refuse

677
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,740
to have kids

678
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,300
just to cater to their feelings.

679
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,780
No need to do that.

680
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,980
So, just be careful, okay?

681
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,500
Alright.

682
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,740
Don't worry, Jiali.

683
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,980
I'll be careful.

684
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Go to sleep.

685
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,740
Are you nervous?

686
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,220
No.

687
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,780
Another one is getting married.

688
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,480
It's better when you all leave.

689
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,420
Out of all the sisters,

690
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,140
you're the only one who can help me.

691
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,820
Jiali.

692
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,340
(Bride)

693
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,140
Help me put it on.

694
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,820
Don't rush.

695
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,340
This room will be yours soon.

696
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,300
I'm not in a hurry.

697
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,980
Why would I be in a hurry?

698
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,940
I know.

699
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,780
You've always disliked me.

700
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,700
Since we were little,

701
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,260
you always liked

702
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,740
to compare with me.

703
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,380
But no matter what,
you're still my sister.

704
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,460
So, if you face any difficulties,

705
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,100
you have to tell me.

706
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,140
Jiawen,

707
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,540
of course, I like you.

708
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,780
Now you have to leave.

709
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,540
I really feel

710
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,340
a bit reluctant.

711
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,100
Don't cry.

712
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,540
There's no banquet that never ends.

713
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,540
We all have to go through this.

714
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,340
Don't cry.

715
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,380
Now, can you help me put it on?

716
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,180
Come on.

717
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,300
No more crying.

718
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,620
(Happiness)

719
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,700
(Yunpian Cake)

720
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,980
(Two months later)

721
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,780
(Family Tradition: Kind)

722
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,660
Mom, look.

723
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,500
This is the Huangshan
Guest-Welcoming Pine.

724
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,060
Huangshan.

725
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,900
It's so beautiful.

726
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,620
What about this one?

727
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,540
This is the Bund.

728
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,660
Yes, the Bund.

729
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,980
Shanghai.

730
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,820
The Huangpu River.

731
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,620
What about this one?

732
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,060
This is the Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou.

733
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,620
Lingyin Temple.

734
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,820
Did you make a wish?

735
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,220
I did.

736
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,460
Good.

737
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,700
I knew it.

738
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,500
This trip was well arranged.

739
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,780
Not only did you have fun,

740
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,700
but you also brought back my grandson.

741
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,900
Mom,

742
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,660
we don't know
if it's a boy or a girl yet.

743
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,580
No matter if it's a boy or a girl,

744
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,660
I'll love it.

745
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,020
Rascal, it's your fault.

746
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,340
You didn't tell me the good news.

747
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,260
If Jiawen hadn't reacted,

748
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,380
I would still be in the dark.

749
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,620
You just don't know

750
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,220
what should be hidden from me.

751
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,700
I didn't hide it from you, Mom.

752
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,820
It's still not three months yet.

753
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,020
Once it's past three months and safe,

754
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,420
I'll definitely tell you.

755
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,500
Nonsense.

756
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
It's already safe now.

757
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,100
- Yes.
- Right?

758
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,900
Jiawen,

759
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,380
what do you want to eat?

760
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,900
I want some fried dough twist.

761
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,500
- OK.
- I'll buy it for you.

762
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,260
The ones outside aren't clean.

763
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,380
I'll fry it for you.

764
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,760
I was just waiting for you to say that.

765
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,340
Mom, fry some vegetable balls too.

766
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,100
Thanks, Mom.

767
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,540
Jiawen,

768
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
eat some fish.

769
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,900
Thanks, Mom.

770
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,620
Be careful of the bones.

771
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,460
OK.

772
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,540
I'll help you

773
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,620
pick the bones later.

774
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,460
Right, let him pick the bones.

775
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,460
That's not necessary.

776
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,740
- Just in case it gets stuck.
- Eat this.

777
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,820
Eat a piece of braised pork.

778
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,220
OK.

779
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,700
- Here.
- Have this.

780
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,540
Eat this.

781
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,180
Jiawen, eat as much as you want.

782
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,860
You're now
our priority protected person.

783
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,360
Priority protected person indeed.

784
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,300
Mom,

785
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,220
Jiawen is amazing.

786
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,020
Weiguo,

787
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,920
you guys try harder and have a few more.

788
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,180
We can also benefit a bit.

789
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,380
Kesi, the kids

790
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,020
will be ours. What benefit do you get?

791
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,060
I mean

792
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
you can have more.

793
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,820
If you can't raise them,

794
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,060
I'll raise them with Yimin.

795
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,580
Let's focus on eating.

796
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
No talking.

797
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,260
Eat quietly, sleep quietly.

798
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,140
- It's fine, Mom.
- You're an adult.

799
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
It's fine.

800
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,280
- Just eat.
- It's fine.

801
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,420
- What's wrong?
- It's fine.

802
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,540
- Have some soup.
- OK.

803
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,500
It's Kesi and Yimin's fault.

804
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,700
This is different.

805
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,660
Kesi is anxious.

806
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,580
You know.

807
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,340
He even wanted Chunhua's first child.

808
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,780
That's Chunhua's first child.

809
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,180
Why should she give it to them?

810
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,860
Later, Chunhua wanted

811
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,270
to give them the younger one,

812
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,940
but they refused.

813
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,260
What does that show?

814
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,540
What does that show?

815
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,180
It shows they didn't want them.

816
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,940
After all, it's not their own child.

817
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,940
Hesitating is normal.

818
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,180
I'm telling you.

819
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,740
I'm not going to give them my kids.

820
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,140
Don't worry about that.

821
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,740
I'll stand by you on this.

822
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,220
As long as we don't give in,

823
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,940
Mom won't make it hard for us.

824
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,580
One, two, go.

825
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
You're heavier.

826
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,340
Of course.

827
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,700
I'm not alone now.

828
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,140
Go back, or my parents will see you.

829
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,660
I'm not afraid.

830
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,580
I'm afraid.

831
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,300
Jiayi,

832
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,380
when are you going

833
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,680
to make our relationship public?

834
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,420
We don't have a relationship.

835
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,180
You're really not in a hurry?

836
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,180
Your sisters are already married.

837
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,380
It's your turn now.

838
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,300
Ouyang, this is my business.

839
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,680
What does it have to do with you?

840
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,860
Also,

841
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,420
I didn't ask you to follow me.

842
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,860
You insisted on following me.

843
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,700
Right now, we're just friends,

844
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,380
nothing more.

845
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,700
Don't get the wrong idea.

846
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
I'll wait for you.

847
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,380
That's your business.

848
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,580
For as long as time exists,

849
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,420
even until the sea dries,

850
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,380
I'll wait for you.

851
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,340
Then wait.

852
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,100
(Eight months later)

853
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,900
Jiawen,

854
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,580
I think it's kicking me.

855
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,860
It's moving a lot now.

856
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,900
So naughty.

857
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,900
What do you feel now?

858
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,460
I just feel like there's extra flesh
in my belly.

859
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,020
It's almost time.

860
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,500
Chunrong, can you give me the clothes

861
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,660
of your kids?

862
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,100
Sure, I've kept them.

863
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,940
OK.

864
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,700
Coming.

865
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,300
Mom.

866
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,540
It's hot.

867
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,540
Slow down.

868
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,460
Here, here.

869
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,220
Mom, I can't eat anymore.

870
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,740
I'm too full.

871
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,860
You're not alone now.

872
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,300
If you don't eat,

873
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,380
my grandson has to eat.

874
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,420
Come on.

875
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,340
How's it?

876
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,020
It's so delicious.

877
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,940
One more bite?

878
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,060
What's wrong?

879
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,740
Mom,

880
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,260
my stomach feels a bit...

881
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,020
Does your stomach hurt?

882
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,100
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

883
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,700
It's cold outside. Use the potty.

884
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,940
No, Mom.

885
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,580
I might...

886
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,540
- What's wrong?
- Maybe it's time.

887
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,940
Hurry! Hurry!

888
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,700
Find a handcart.

889
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,620
Hurry!

890
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,580
- It's time!
- Come on.

891
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,660
Don't panic, Mom.

892
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,820
Don't panic, don't panic.

893
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,060
- I'm here.
- Sure.

894
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,180
Take a deep breath.

895
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,660
Tell me.

896
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,100
Why hasn't anything

897
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,940
happened yet?

898
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,860
You know...

899
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,860
This...

900
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,340
This is a woman's life-or-death moment.

901
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,060
Mrs. Chen, come here.

902
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,580
(Labor Ward)
Sit down.

903
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,340
Do you want walnut cakes?

904
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,060
You keep pacing back and forth.

905
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,020
It's making me anxious too.

906
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,380

00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,940

(Labor Ward)

909
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,480
- The power's out?
- The power's out?

910
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,320
