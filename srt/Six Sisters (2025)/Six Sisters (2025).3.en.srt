Coming.

17
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,230
Delivering milk again?

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
We really don't need it.

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,120
There's no milk today.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,870
Just say what you need to say.

21
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,640
This isn't the right place to talk.

22
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,000
What's not right about it?

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,870
It's broad daylight under the open sky.

24
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,590
Everything should be put on the table.

25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,870
Alright, I'll say it right here then.

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
Go ahead, no need to hesitate.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,240
Do you know that Tang Weimin

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
has a great-uncle?

29
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,150
What great-uncle?

30
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,630
Don't try to make connections here.

31
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,630
You weren't married back then,

32
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,030
so you probably don't know.

33
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,240
It's Tang's uncle.

34
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,310
He used to be

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,030
a Communist Party member.

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,710
Our family has produced many martyrs.

37
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,800
But later,

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,430
he switched to the Kuomintang.

39
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,330
Before the liberation,
he fled to Shanghai

40
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,940
and then followed them to China Taiwan.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,840
Nonsense.

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,800
Who knows better

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,630
about the older generation, you or me?

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,840
What exactly do you want?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,280
Tell your husband

46
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,840
that we live

47
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,590
different lives.

48
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,030
Let's not cross paths.

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,130
Even a rabbit will bite when cornered.

50
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,120
We share the same hometown.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,710
Being loyal and righteous
makes our lives easier.

52
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,150
Talking to you like this

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,910
just makes me mad at myself.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
Tang,

55
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,270
something happened.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Something big.

57
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,680
What is it?

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,280
Mrs. He just told me

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,800
your uncle wasn't
a revolutionary martyr at all.

60
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,800
She said he first went to Shanghai

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,070
and then fled to China Taiwan.

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,590
Impossible.

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,540
Why not?

64
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,730
He even fled to China Taiwan?

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,590
That's right.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Is this true?

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,400
Mrs. He just spoke about it
in great detail,

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
almost spreading it around.

69
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,280
Tang,

70
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,030
if outsiders find out

71
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,430
that your uncle was a spy,

72
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,280
our whole family is doomed.

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,400
You need to remember this:

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,430
Don't make enemies anymore.

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,630
Be polite to He.

76
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,870
Do you hear me?

77
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,030
Be polite to him?

78
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,400
Be polite to him?

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,630
You must.

80
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,910
You need to understand
how serious this is now.

- All done?

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,440
- Yes.
- Okay.

84
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,670
Close it.

85
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
Wait.

86
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,680
Should we count again?

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,740
Didn't we count already?

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,430
We did,

89
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,040
but a few extra bags were added.

90
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,300
Then count again.

91
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,870
I went to buy you pig's head meat.

92
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,960
Really?

93
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
I don't know about that.

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Let me do it.

95
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
Yes, yes.

96
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
He,

97
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,310
why did you go there?

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,430
Let me do it.

99
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,080

100
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,960

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
He,

102
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,910
well done.

103
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Mom.

104
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
You're back.

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,160
What are you busy with?

106
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,000
The factory is so busy.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,950
I've fallen behind.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Busy with what?

109
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,690
Studying

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,010
and self-education.

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,800
Changsheng, why are you back so early?

112
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,730
He didn't make it into the Party.

113
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,630
Why not?

114
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,870
Did Big Tang mess things up again?

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,480
What nonsense are you saying?

116
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,870
Don't make baseless accusations.

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,800
He's been pretty polite to me lately.

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,750
Pretty polite to you?

119
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,240
See? I told you.

120
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,480
Neighbors

121
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,110
should get along, right?

122
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,070
It's socialism.

123
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,920
We should help each other.

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Mom,

125
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,510
your awareness has improved.

126
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,310

That's impressive.

129

You're already a model worker.

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,830
Don't aim too high.

131
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,870
Mom, I'm just a factory model worker,

132
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,870
not even a district-level one.

133
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,430
Look at the national model workers.

134
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,620
They get to go to Beijing to be awarded.

135
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,830
Everyone has their own fate.

136
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,830

I know Beijing is in the north.

142
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,070
I remember you once said

143
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,920
you've been to Beijing, right?

144
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,710
Tell me about it.

145
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,310
When did you go there?

146
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
Come on.

147
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,430
I have been there.

Back then,

149
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,830
your father took me north

150
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,480
for business.

151
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,600
It wasn't called Beijing then.

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
It was Beiping.

153
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,270
How did it feel?

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
It was windy

155
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
and dusty.

156
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,310
Windy and dusty?

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
That was before liberation.

158
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,510
Now that it's liberated,

159

cotton thread.

188
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
You can give it to Jiayi or Jiahuan.

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,030
Grandma, I want one too!

192
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,630
Just knit one for Jiali.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
You're fully grown.

194
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,030
Your little sisters are still young.

195
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,790
In the future, when they grow up,

196
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,600
you can pass yours down to them.

197
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,270
What's wrong?

198
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,150
Jiayi,

199
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,630
why are you crying?

200
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,270
Jiali can work,

201
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,600
but can you?

202
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
I can work too!

203
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
You can work?

204
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
What kind of work can you do?

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,240
Mom, I don't have a single sweater.

206
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,080
Mom, knit one for Jiayi.

207
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,140
When she's done with it,
Jiahuan can wear it.

208
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,170
If Jiahuan can wear it,

209
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,570
my younger brother can wear it too.

210
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,440
Make it a boys' style.

211
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,700
When my brother comes along,

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,600
I will give it to him.

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
How do you know it'll be a boy?

214
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,480
I dreamed it.

215
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,470
Really?

216
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,560
Really.

217
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,610
Make it a girls' style.

218
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,090
It's a girl who will wear it first.

219
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,240
Things should be done in order.

220
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,510
Why knit a boys' style?

221
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,240
Even if the fifth kid is a boy,

222
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,720
he'll still be a little kid.

223
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,200
The style doesn't matter.

224
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
He can just make do with it.

225
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,270
Give it to Jiayi.

226
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,360
Because you had that dream.

227
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,000
Dreams are always the opposite.

228
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,080
The fifth kid will be a boy.

229
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,120
That's a good dream.

230
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,140
(Huainan Chunyan Brewing Factory)

231
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720
Are you alright?

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,140
Meixin.

233
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,360
(Mrs. Zhu)
Come here! Hurry!

234
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
No sugar cubes are left,

235
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
but the biscuits are sweet too.

236
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,200
Hurry and eat a couple.

237
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,360
Where did you get these?

238
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,840
I borrowed them from Mrs. Zhu.

239
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,510
- Borrowed?
- Eat up.

240
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,360
I'm fine. It's just low blood sugar.

241
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,790
I just need to rest a bit.

242
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,910
You're overworked.

243
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,720
Listen.

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,360
Starting tomorrow,
you're not going to work.

245
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,700
I'll go to your workplace
and request leave for you.

246
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,630
Just rest at home.

247
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,450
I can't. This is a critical moment
for group assignments.

248
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,990
What group?

249
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,120
The factory sent workers
to Shenyang and Shanghai

250
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,150
to learn MSG production techniques.

251
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,790
We're about to launch

252
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,150
a new MSG product.

253
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,610
What does that have to do with you?

254
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,150
Aren't you in the soy sauce group?

255
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,030
Making MSG

256
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,150
requires more technical skills
than making soy sauce.

257
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,240
In the factory,

258
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,150
the MSG group members

259
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,960
have a higher status than others.

260
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,240
We're just waiting
for those workers to return

261
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,800
so we can experiment with fermentation.

262
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,460
If I get involved now,

263
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,750
I'll naturally become
part of the MSG group.

264
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,440
If you want to get involved,

265
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,360
at least be mindful of how to do it.

266
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,080
You should just

267
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,320
observe and learn.

268
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,160
Don't do anything.

269
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,960
You're pregnant.

270
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,440
What if something

271
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,550
happens again,

272
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,750
like today?

273
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,510
I was terrified

274
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,620
when I heard you fainted at work.

275
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,000
- You...
- Which one of us are you worried about?

276
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,080
I...

277
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,390
Of course, I'm worried about you.

278
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,040
The Party Secretary

279
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,310
expressed sincere concern

280
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,440
for Comrade Meixin fainting on the job.

281
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,000
At the same time,
he praised Comrade Meixin

282
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,650
for her dedication
to the factory and her position.

283
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,510
He hopes all employees

284
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,790
will take responsibility
like owners of the factory.

285
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,960
Does anyone have any opinions?

286
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,550
Feel free to speak your mind.

287
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,000
Feel free to talk.

288
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,120
I'd like to say a few words.

289
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,030
Chairman Mao taught us to be resolute,

290
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,100
fear no sacrifice,

291
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,150
surmount every difficulty,

292
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,360
and fight for victory.

293
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,600
Since the factory leaders
trust us so much,

294
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,310
we must not let personal reasons

295
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,480
hold back the collective.

296
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,760
I believe we should always be ready

297
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,670
to contribute to the prosperity
of our nation.

298
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,870
Good!

299
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,360
Comrade Meixin's dedication to work
is something

300
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,440
we should all learn from.

301
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
Come on.

302
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,630
This...

303
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,840
Why is there such a big hole?

304
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,910
What do we do now?

305
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,480
It's just a vat.

306
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,910
- Let's go.
- No.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,910
What are you doing?

308
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,750
It's fine.

309
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,680
I'll use my raincoat.

310
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,790
But you're pregnant.

311
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,840
It's alright.

312
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,510
Your awareness is indeed better.

313
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,390
Come on. Hurry.

314
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,000
Put it on.

315
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,350
You too.

316
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
Alright, let's go.

317
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,110
Meixin!

318
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,590
Meixin!

319
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
Meixin!

320
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,600
Someone help!

321
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,960
Help!

322
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
Meixin!

323
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,510
Meixin! Meixin!

324
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,030
Is anyone here? Anyone here?

325
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,480
I've told her many times

326
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,720
that she's pregnant
and it's inconvenient.

327
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,830
I asked her not to go.

328
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,030
But she just wouldn't listen.

329
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,240
Lower your voice.

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Can't you say this at home?

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,440
You should care about her now.

332
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,740
She's had five near-death experiences

333
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
for our family.

334
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,360
She's hurting too.

335
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,390
I know. Who wouldn't be?

336
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,000
Who would want this to happen?

337
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,510
But she was too careless.

338
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,480
We still have to face it.

339
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,790
We've been long hoping for a boy.

340
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,550
We finally had one, but this happened.

341
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
She was too careless.

342
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,870
How am I supposed to face this?

343
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,720
Meixin,

344
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,000
eat something.

345
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,310
Your health is what matters.

346
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
Everything else is unimportant.

347
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,960
Ladle some chicken soup for your mom.

348
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,680
Where's Changsheng?

349
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,800
Changsheng?

350
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,410
He's on a business trip.

351
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,140
I agreed to let him go,

352
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
so he could see how hard it is out there

353
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,480
and how comfortable home is.

354
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,790
Jiawen is so thoughtful.

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She noticed the chilblains
on your hands.

356
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,260
You want your mom
to apply ointment, right?

357
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,380
(He Jiahuan, He's fourth daughterily)

358
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,200
During the postpartum period,

359
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,680
don't touch any cold water.

360
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,720
Jiawen, Jiayi, once you're done,
wash your hands.

361
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,750
Okay, Grandma.

362
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,920
What are you making?

363
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,960
Oh, egg custard.

364
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,790
It must be for Mom.

365
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,750
Your mom needs to be taken care of now.

366
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,960
Be good to her.

367
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
Got it.

368
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
Giving birth to a child

369
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,550
is like walking
through the gates of death.

370
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,110
Your mom has been through it many times.

371
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,550
My heart aches for her.

372
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,680
Dad is wrong about this.

373
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,750
The workplace arranged

374
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,310
this business trip for him.

375
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,550
That's not true.

376
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,640
He volunteered to go.

377
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,790
Even if he did,

378
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,200
there's nothing wrong with that.

379
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,350
If the baby had been a girl,

380
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,200
would Dad have still run away from home?

381
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,350
How can you say that?

382
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,550
That sounds harsh.

383
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,030
It has nothing to do
with the baby's gender.

384
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,510
It does.

385
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,200
It's backward and outdated thinking.

386
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,070
Don't talk about him like that.

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,750
I really sympathize with Mom.

388
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,000
I do too.

389
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,880
But she could've...

390
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,790
Forget it. Let's not talk about it.

391
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,670
Come on.

392
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,300
The egg custard is ready.

393
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,270
Take it to your mom.

394
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,550
You have to feed her.

395
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,760
I know.

396
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,200
Are you really going to unravel it?

397
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,960
Just a small section,

398
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,440
enough to make a pair of gloves.

399
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,640
I can unravel it,

400
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,830
but if you want to make gloves,

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,550
the sweater

402
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,640
will be too small for you.

403
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,550
That's fine.

404
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,750
I'll just give it to Jiayi or Jiahuan.

405
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,400
There are so many girls in the family.

406
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680
Someone will wear it.

407
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,880
Alright, I'll unravel it.

408
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
Do it.

409
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
Meixin really has it tough.

410
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,830
It's too hard for her.

411
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Why do you suddenly
want to make gloves?

412
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,200
My mom has chilblains.

413
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,310
You're such a thoughtful daughter.

414
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,310
It's a piece of cake.

415
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,920
No problem for me.

416
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,960
You're just slicing the potatoes,

417
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,930
yet you make it so thick.

418
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,880
Does it really matter?

419
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,920
Alright, alright.

420
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
You can cook later.

421
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,080
I'll do the slicing.

422
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,440
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

423
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,200
Dad is back!

424
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,280
Did you miss me?

425
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,250
I did.

426
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,350
You did?

427
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,280
Where did you miss me?

428
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,640
Where did you miss me?

429
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,400
Your dad is back?

430
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,830
Come on, help me carry this.

431
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,740
Wow, you can do this.

432
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,240
Do you like this color?

433
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,360
Wear it for the Chinese New Year.

434
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,440
This one's for your sister.

435
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,680
This one's for Jiahuan, okay?

436
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,200
Dad, Jiahuan's feet are small.

437
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,070
I'll keep it for her.

438
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,910
Alright.

439
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,160
You can keep it for her.

440
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,140
Meixin.

441
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,630
Meixin.

442
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,680
Changsheng is back.
He brought you some socks.

443
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,780
- Put them away for now.
- Grandma.

444
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,210
Let's save them for
the Chinese New Year, okay?

445
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,110
Jiali, is the food ready?

446
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,030
It's done. We can eat now.

447
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,000
Jiali, this is for you.

448
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,830
I don't want it.

449
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,710
Wearing them makes my feet stink.

450
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,110
Changsheng,

451
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,830
Jiali knew you were coming back,

452
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,310
so she made all the dishes today.

453
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,310
I'll taste them later.

454
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,830
How can a man run away from battle?

455
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,070
What did she say?

456
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,540
Running away from battle?

457
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,280
Who did that?

458
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,630
What's wrong?

459
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,920
I'll sleep here tonight.

460
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,110
You're arguing again?

461
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,190
No.

462
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,720
Come on.

463
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,240
Let him say what he wants.

464
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
You should just sleep.

465
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,830
Watching him

466
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
is just frustrating.

467
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,240
Jiali,

468
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,480
scoot over when you sleep.

469
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,020
Let your mom squeeze in for the night.

470
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,790
I can take Jiawen and Jiayi
to the other room.

471
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,480
No need. Don't fuss.

472
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,510
Come on, squeeze in a little.

473
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,680
Everyone, make some room.

474
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
Let's sleep together.

475
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,000
It's fine. I'll just make do there.

476
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,200
Make some space.

477
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,440
You're really going?

478
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,060
I don't feel cold easily.

479
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,030
Jiali,

480
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,030
do you resent me a little?

481
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,320
No.

482
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,440
It's okay if you do.

483
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,440
Do you think I'm selfish?

484
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,880
Sometimes, people do this.

485
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,200
When they lack something,

486
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,510
they crave it even more.

487
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,640
I hope you can forgive me.

488
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,670
How is it?

489
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,200
It looks great.

490
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,590
Try it on.

491
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,790
It's the latest style.

492
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,790
How should I thank you?

493
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,310
No need for that between us.

494
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,670
Mom.

495
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,480
Dad was asking about you all night.

496
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,790
I barely got any sleep.

497
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,560
Look.

498
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,750
Dad asked me to give you this.

499
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,310
It's the latest style.

500
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,720
He saw the chilblains on your hands.

501
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,920
He feels bad for you.

502
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,910
Mom,

503
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,880
don't hold it against Dad anymore.

504
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,510
He's actually quite pitiful too.

505
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,270
Mom, I'm back.

506
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,720
Alright, Mom, don't cry.

507
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,950
Dad's home.

508
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,110
I'll go check
if Grandma finished cooking.

509
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,350
Changsheng,

510
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,800
thank you.

511
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,920
What are you thanking me for?

512
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,310
The gloves.

513
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,550
Where did you get the yarn coupon?

514
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,640
How much did it cost?

515
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,350
This child...

516
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,260
I need the needles and threads.

517
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,350
Give it to me.

518
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,950
Give it to me.

519
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,350
The buttons are here.

520
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,790
Changsheng, I'm sorry.

521
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,750
I'm so sorry.

522
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,840
Jiayi.

523
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,590
He Jiayi.

524
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,150
What's up?

525
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,790
Where's my sweater?

526
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,510
It's your sweater. Why ask me?

527
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,160
Didn't you take it?

528
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,790
How could I hide such a big sweater?

529
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,310
Jiali, don't wrong me.

530
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,790
Dad's back.

531
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,630
I'm back.

532
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,310
- Dad's back.
- Alright.

533
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Go play.

534
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,720
Go play.

535
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,920
Jiali.

536
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,750
Mystery solved.

537
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,160
What mystery?

538
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,480
Dad took your sweater.
It's in that room.

539
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,200
Dad,

540
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,240
why did you do that?

541
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,880
What do you mean?

542
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,350
I...

543
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,400
You can care about your mom,

544
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,340
but can't I care about you?

545
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
Try it on, and see if it fits.

546
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,720
Dad, this is not fair.

547
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,110
Jiali's sweater is so pretty.
It's not fair.

548
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,680
It's not fair?

549
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,350
What...

550
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,390
My eyes hurt.

551
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,840
Wait

552
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,590
till the Chinese New Year,

553
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,920
and I'll get each of you one.

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,030
We belong

565
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,550
to different camps now.

566
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,270
Didn't we go underground?

567
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,000
That's not necessary.

568
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,620
(Gao Yubao)

569
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,630
Qiufang.

570
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,560
Give this to Jiali.

571
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,800
Everyone, look.

572
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,510
Y plus b over b

573
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,870
minus y plus d

574
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,680
plus a over a

575
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,920
equals zero.

576
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,460
(Jiali, I'll always be your friend.
From Weimin)

577
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,550
Alright, let's continue.

578
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,030
From the equation above,

579
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,440
we derive the following answer.

580
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,030
Y plus b over b

581
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,830
minus y plus d...

582
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,020
(Chairman Mao requested
to turn lands into gardens)

583
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,070
I just overheard them

584
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,750
discussing graduation plans.

585
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,350
Weimin said a few things, too.

586
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,830
What did he say?

587
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,160
He's worried and lost.

588
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,430
What about you?

589
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,110
I don't know.

590
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,410
My family will decide for me.

591
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,760
And you?

592
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,200
I want to join the army.

593
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,840
- Qiufang.
- That's great.

594
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,920
The rapeseed flowers here are beautiful.

595
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,070
Come and see.

596
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,240
Coming.

597
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,480
Let's go look at the flowers.

598
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,160
You go ahead. I'll finish this first.

599
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,590
I'll pick some for you.

600
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,350
Jiali,

601
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,240
drink some water.

602
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,310
No need, I have my own.

603
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,750
Is Gao Yubao a good book?

604
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,590
In life,

605
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,160
you should follow your heart.

606
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,840
Anyway,

607
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,160
I have you in my heart,

608
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,790
and you have me in yours.

609
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,050
Tang Weimin, say one more word
and I'll hit you.

610
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,400
Why won't you admit it?

611
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,020
Give it to me. I'll do it.

612
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,480
Take a break.

613
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,520
Take a break.

614
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
There's a snake!

615
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,920
Qiufang!

616
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,680
Jiali, don't go.

617
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,960
- Don't follow me.
- No, I...

618
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,430
Are you alright?

619
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,800
Jiali.

620
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,160
Let's find someone to check.

621
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,110
Let's go.

622
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,560
Tang Weimin.

623
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,110
Put me down.

624
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,510
So many people are watching.

625
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,790
Tang Weimin, put me down.

626
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Don't move.

627
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,350
- Put me down.
- Stop struggling,

628
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,750
or you'll both fall.

629
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,070
Stop playing the hero
all the time, got it?

630
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,270
Did you eat garlic?

631
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,190
Your breath stinks.

632
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,910
Does it?

633
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,800
Yes.

634
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,110
Then I'll turn my head.

635
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,920
I can't help it. I love garlic.

636
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,310
You just smelled it?

637
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,510
I smelled it ages ago.

638
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,240
I smelled it from far away.

639
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,070
Why mess with the pickled garlic?

640
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,310
It's not ready yet.

641
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,640
Mom, I'm heading out.

642
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,070
Where are you going
with that pickled garlic?

643
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Stinky!

644
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,320
What's wrong?

645
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
It's for you.

646
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,070
I love it.

647
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,360
Now we're even.

648
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,480
Just like that?

649
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,880
You can owe me.

650
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,030
Don't forget to return my jar.

651
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,670
Don't go yet.

652
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,630
I'll return it now.

653
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,550
I'll eat it right now.

654
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,030
My hands are occupied.

655
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,070
Help me out.

656
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,030
Give me a hand.

657
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,110
I want to eat it now,

658
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,550
but I don't have extra hands.

659
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,360
Tastes good.

660
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,670
I didn't wash my hands.

661
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,320
It's okay.

662
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,110

663
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,350
Got it?

664
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Yes.

It is necessary for educated youth

to go to the countryside
to receive re-education

668
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,410
from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

669
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,550
We must persuade city cadres and others

670
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,840
to send their middle school,
high school,

671
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,070
and university graduates
to the countryside.

672
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,800
Mobilization is needed.

673
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,760
Will Jiali go to the countryside?

674
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
Jiali...

675
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,360
Well, Jiali...

677
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,760
Jiali,

678
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,760
you're graduating soon.

679
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
What are your plans?

680
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,100
I want to join the army.

681
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,400
I heard that after serving,

682
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,590
you can get assigned a job,

683
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,960
and it's a state job too.

684
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,110
If you were a boy,

685
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,510
joining the army would be great.

686
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,810
They recruit soldiers every year,

687
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,110
but I've never heard

688
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,920
of our district
recruiting female soldiers.

689
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,550
Such a pity. Looks like our family

690
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,880
will never have a soldier.

691
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,260
Blaming me again

692
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,800
for not giving your family a son
fit for the army.

693
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,230
That's not what I meant.

694
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,410
Don't overthink it.

695
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,590
I was just saying if Jiali were...

696
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,190
Just eat.

697
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,280

It's not that we won't let you,

for female soldiers now.

will come in a few days.

This young comrade wants to enlist,

714
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,630
but we haven't received any notices

715
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,840
for female recruitment.

716
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,510
Comrade, I volunteer to join the PLA.

but unfortunately,
there's no plan for it this year.

You're the director?

I'm Zhang Jianguo.

722
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,920
You're so young and already a director?

723
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,710
Director Zhang enlisted at 15.

724
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,110
He's a true veteran.

725
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,480

726
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,800
Where's the fish?

727
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,020

He passed away.

732
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,670
It happened yesterday.

733
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,230
They say it might've been
a heart attack.

734
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,800
By the time they found him,

735
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,030
he was already gone.

736
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,710
I have to go there.

737
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,670

Where's the kerosene lamp?

740
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,150
How could he just be gone like that?

I saw yours.

751
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,460
(Zhang Qiufang)
Feidong.

752
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,750
Does it mean we won't
see each other anymore?

753
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,550
Feidong and Feixi
are just one character apart.

754
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,390
It's not far.

755
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,740
(Tang Weimin: Feixi)

756
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,550
Weimin will go to Feixi.

757
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,910
Jiali,

758
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,230
has the list for the countryside
come out?

759
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,630
I'll go to Feixi, Grandma.

760
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,150
When I brought you to Huainan,

761
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,920
you were only ten.

762
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,920
In the blink of an eye,

763
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
you're old enough to work.

764
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,190
How time flies.

765
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,030
Once you're in the countryside,

766
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,510
you'll have to take care of yourself.

767
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,880
I know.

768
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,560
Weimin, here. Take this bag of food.

769
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,680
(Fulfill ambitions in the countryside)
Mom, no need.

770
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,580
There's nothing there.

771
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,430
Food will be precious.

772
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,110
- Just take it.
- I'm leaving.

773
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,640
Give me a kiss.

774
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,810
Don't cause trouble.
Get along with your classmates.

775
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,150
I know.
What trouble could I possibly cause?

776
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,230
Write home often.

777
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,480
(Zhang Qiulin)
Take care of yourself out there.

778
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,320
Make sure to eat on time.

779
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,230
Alright.

780
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
It's fine.

781
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,950
Jiali.

782
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,160
- I don't want it, Grandma.
- Take it.

783
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,440
You'll need money outside.

784
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,190
You're leaving home.

785
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,550
Take it.

786
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,150
Listen.

787
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,630
After you leave,

788
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,800
I want to take a trip back
to our hometown in Jiangdu.

789
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,670
Write to your parents often

790
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,320
when you have time.

791
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,110
Do Mom and Dad know?

792
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Yes.

793
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,030
This is our room?

794
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,400
We'll all live here.

795
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,870
This place is nice.

796
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,400
So clean.

797
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,440
Then I'll take this bed.

798
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,550
The lighting here is great.

799
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,850
I like sleeping by the window.

800
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,670
It has everything here.

801
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,730
It has everything we need.

802
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,320
I'll sleep here, then.

803
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,600
I'll sleep here.

804
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,280
Then I'll sleep next to you.

805
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,120
Alright.

806
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,960
Then I'll take the innermost side.

807
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,800
Sure.

808
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,670
Let's sleep here.

809
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,000
You'll sleep on the edge.

810
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,670
