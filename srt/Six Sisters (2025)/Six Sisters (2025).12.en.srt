15
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,260
Dad is gone.

16
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,770
We must be more united as a family.

17
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,290
Let's stop turning against each other.

18
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,050
Go to school

19
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,130
or go to work as usual.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Mom is in poor health
and she's on medication.

21
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,540
Grandma is old.

22
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,260
She can't get mad or tired.

23
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,570
Come to me if you need anything.

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,930
If I'm away, talk to Jiawen.

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,340
Jiayi.

26
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,980
You will turn in more wages.

27
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,170
But Jiali,

28
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,820
I always follow the rules.

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,100
The number is improper.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,290
So will Jiawen.

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,570
And the rest of you.

32
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,940
You'll have less pocket money.

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,780
We'll have a hard time.

34
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,780
Jiali,

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,660
we can't just save money.
We must earn money.

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,780
How?

37
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,220
By working.

38
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,060
Dad's job should be taken over.

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,100
I can go to work anytime.

40
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,410
Jiali,

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,100
I must get Dad's job.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,340
Why?

43
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,940
I'm your elder sister.

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,290
Get the order right, ok?

45
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,290
Dad promised

46
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,540
his job would be mine.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,450
Go on. Keep lying.

48
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,890
- I...
- Do you have proof?

49
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,730
Stop it.

50
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,570
Before we know if the job is available,

51
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,690
you're fighting for it.

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,500
Can't you give it up for each other?

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,500
Well, break it up.

54
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,980
No, no. I can't take it.

55
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,410
Take it, Jiali.

56
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,410
- Come on.
- I can't.

57
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,610
I seldom come back.

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,540
I should do something.

59
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,970
Fine.

60
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,260
I'll write it down.

61
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,850
Let me hold it, Jiali.

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,100
How's the job thing going?

63
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,890
It hasn't started yet.

64
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,850
0.2 yuan, please.

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,500
Anyway,

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,850
it's my turn to get a job, right?

67
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,500
Not until we can get the job.

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,700
I mean, when we get it.

69
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,780
Right? Look at the scar on my face.

70
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,490
People will be mean to me.

71
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,460
How could I live without the job?

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,290
People live whatever they look like.

73
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
You know what I mean.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,780
Didn't you say
wanted to study accounting?

75
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,580
Mom said you did well in that.

76
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,980
I won't study. I want a job immediately.

77
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,490
You can take Gaokao.

78
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,850
No, I can't.

79
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,930
And people study just to get a job.

80
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,290
Listen. Ms. Liu told me
Zhang Qiulin would register.

81
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,460
Jobs are different.

82
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,140
Look. Qiufang went to college

83
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,290
and she has a great job now.

84
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,170
You should learn more skills
while you're young.

85
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,850
Anyway, Xiaoling can't have the job.

86
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,460
I just told you to be more united.

87
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,700
Stop turning against her.

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,930
Xiaoling isn't your enemy.

89
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,930
She's your sister.

90
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,130
Jiali.

91
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,330
Jiali.

92
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,020
When can I

93
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,100
take over Dad's job?

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,700
Are you old enough?

95
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,420
Yes.

96
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,580
Wait, then.

97
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,940
Jiali,

98
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,540
if I can't take over Dad's job,

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,900
I will...

100
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,380
You will what?

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,810
Nothing.

102
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,100
You both want the job.

103
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,250
How self-centered.

104
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,100
Go get a job if you can.

105
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,810
You know I can't.

106
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,050
Grandma.

107
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,020
Stop it, Xiaoling.

108
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,660
Go feed the chickens.

109
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,700
How's the job thing going?

110
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,170
We aren't rejected.

111
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,490
We're just asked to wait.

112
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,140
(People's Hospital)

113
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,010
Jiayi.

114
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,250
Jiawen.

115
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,340
Weiguo.

116
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,050
You guys talk.

117
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,250
I'll be waiting out there.

118
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,460
What's wrong with you?

119
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,500
Are you sick?

120
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,450
Would you like some?

121
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,210
Jiawen.

122
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,100
I'll say something.

123
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,740
Good.

124
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,700
I have something to ask you, too.

125
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,890
Ok.

126
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,220
I'll go first.

127
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,170
I'm with Ouyang.

128
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,380
Are you surprised?

129
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,220
Have you made up your mind?

130
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,660
Yes, before I tell you.

131
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,420
These years,

132
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,700
I've had many unrealistic illusions.

133
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,220
But now, I understand.

134
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,900
And I've thought it through.

135
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,370
Maybe Ouyang

136
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,700
actually cares the most about me.

137
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,580
Does our family know?

138
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,060
No.

139
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,690
I know.

140
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,540
They think little of Ouyang's family.

141
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,900
But under such circumstances,

142
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,610
there's no turning back.

143
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,220
When I love him, I love him.

144
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
I can't stop.

145
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,900
What's your plan, then?

146
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,810
You want me to help you?

147
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,090
Yes.

148
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,850
Jiawen.

149
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,180
I have to tell Jiali

150
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,060
as soon as possible.

151
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,540
As soon as possible?

152
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,770
I must get married.

153
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,730
But Jiayi,

154
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,890
we're still mourning for Dad.

155
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,820
Even if you confess now,

156
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,700
no one will approve.

157
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,300
Maybe Jiali will listen to you.

158
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,420
Please do this for me.

159
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll always be grateful.

160
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,900
Jiawen.

161
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,220
I'll try.

162
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Jiali.

163
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,610
Why did you have your hair cut?

164
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,490
Doesn't it look good?
I always wanted to have it cut.

165
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,610
Come on.

166
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,300
Who will take over Dad's job?

167
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,700
Jiahuan is the fourth daughter.

168
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,220
Give it to her.

169
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,890
Xiaoling is old enough, too.

170
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,300
This job of foreign trade is stable.

171
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,420
It's a guaranteed job.
Give it to Xiaoling.

172
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,300
Grandma,

173
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,060
Jiahuan is more capable.
But Xiaoling is naive.

174
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,420
So, she should

175
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,980
take over this job.

176
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,850
She's a rash girl.

177
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,100
She can't do anything else.

178
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,180
She must take the chance

179
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,610
and get a stable job.

180
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,820
Or what if she gets into the society?

181
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,220
She can't get a job herself.

182
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,490
Even if Jianguo and Weiguo help her

183
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,850
to get a job interview,

184
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,660
she can't be good or wise enough

185
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,510
to pass it.

186
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,650
Jiahuan is quick-tempered.

187
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,060
When you tell her about it,

188
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,610
be very gentle.

189
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,010
This is a blessing in disguise.

190
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,060
We can't just focus on this job.

191
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,490
Look at Qiufang.
After graduation, she's a doctor.

192
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,330
Isn't that great?

193
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,980
Jiahuan will graduate
from high school soon.

194
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,060
We should encourage her to take Gaokao.

195
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,420
Going to college
is the best road to choose.

196
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,850
I agree.

197
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,250
Jiahuan, Xiaoling,

198
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,010
which one of you is smarter?

199
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,460
Jiahuan is good at counting.

200
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,300
She does it quickly.

201
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,260
Just like her aunt.

202
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,420
Which one of you is more capable?

203
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,660
Me, of course.

204
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,610
So, I'll take over Dad's job.

205
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,040
I give you my word.

206
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,420
I can win a commendation
within six months.

207
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,180
I can do a good job, too.

208
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
I'll do even better than Jiahuan.

209
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,060
Don't call her that. Call her sister.

210
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,220
Liu Xiaoling, remember.

211
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,700
Jiahuan is always your sister.

212
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,420
She's older than you.

213
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,940
A sister will help and take care of you.

214
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,010
You're only sisters in this life.

215
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,250
You won't meet after death.

216
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,850
You should learn from Jiahuan.

217
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,340
When you behave
and get along with people,

218
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,460
be easy-going

219
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,420
and generous.

220
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,420
Remember?

221
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,610
Yes.

222
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,980
Jiahuan,

223
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,730
let Xiaoling

224
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,580
take over Dad's job.

225
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,850
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,820
Who made this decision,

227
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,610
you, Mom, or Grandma?

228
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,610
Who on earth is in charge now?

229
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,370
Grandma,

230
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,300
say something.

231
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,420
I deserve this job, don't I?

232
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,010
I'm the fourth daughter

233
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,010
while she's the fifth.

234
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,850
Why can she get the job instead of me?

235
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,460
I'm not convinced.
I don't approve, either.

236
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,140
Grandma,

237
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
say something.

238
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,300
Grandma...

239
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,180
Shut up!

240
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,420
Jiahuan,

241
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,420
you'll graduate next year.

242
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,010
Then, you can take Gaokao.

243
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,490
Give the job to Xiaoling.

244
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,820
I won't take Gaokao.

245
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,260
I want the job.

246
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,850
I want to be independent.

247
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
You're wiser than her.

248
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,700
She's more naive.

249
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,610
No, she isn't.

250
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,490
She's much too clever!

251
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,180
Mom,

252
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,420
am I your biological daughter?

253
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,220
Why do you do this to me?

254
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,460
Jiahuan, you're her elder sister.

255
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,850
You should show moral fiber.

256
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,010
She should give up.

257
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,650
You should give it up.

258
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,490
- You...
- Stop it. Come on.

259
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,570
Come on.

260
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,440
Listen to me.

261
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,650
You're also my daughter.

262
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,010
We certainly care for you.

263
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,580
We certainly do.

264
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,980
But think about it.

265
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Xiaoling is in no way better than you.

266
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,890
If she goes into the society,

267
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,610
how can she make a living?

268
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,770
As her sister, you can't
bear to see that.

269
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,610
Right?

270
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,610
Since Xiaoling was born,
your father has never liked her.

271
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,420
Sadly, I named her after me.

272
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,490
Let's make it up to her
by giving her the job.

273
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,730
Mom.

274
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,220
Look. Do you remember what it is?

275
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,580
I'm no longer young and I have a scar.

276
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,770
You owed me first, didn't you?

277
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,980
Shouldn't you make it up to me, Mom?

278
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,730
Dad,

279
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,940
open your eyes and see

280
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,060
how this family has changed.

281
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,610
Dad!

282
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,420
Open your eyes and see.

283
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,850
I know you talked this over!

284
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,300
You prepared all this

285
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,820
just to set me up!

286
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,260
He Jiahuan,

287
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,250
don't you talk to them like that.

288
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,700
I don't care.

289
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,010
Dad's job...

290
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,220
I'll get it. No one else can.

291
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,530
Jiahuan.

292
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,460
- Why?
- Go away.

293
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,650
What are you doing?

294
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,250
Only I can get the job.

295
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,220
Stop it!

296
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,980
I don't want you

297
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
to take over my son's job.

298
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,100
I want him back!

299
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,610
Changsheng.

300
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,580
(Harmony)

301
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,980
(Zhang Qiulin)

302
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,060
Come on.

303
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,850
Stop crying.

304
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,220
Or you'll have to wash my pillow cover.

305
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,890
You don't understand.

306
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,850
Is that job really so important?

307
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,300
Yes. Very, very important.

308
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,490
Extremely important.

309
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,420
Far more important
than your semiconductor.

310
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,460
Oh, you're exaggerating.

311
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,980
You know what?

312
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,220
I'm so fed up with this family.

313
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,980
I want my own life.

314
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,180
So, getting a job

315
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,820
is the fastest way to leave here.

316
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,850
But it may not be the best way.

317
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,730
Tell me what the best way is.

318
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,820
Gaokao.

319
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,060
Oh, come on.

320
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,130
You think like this.

321
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Xiaoling

322
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,250
will start to work.

323
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,770
You'll take Gaokao.

324
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,220
If you're admitted to a college,

325
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,620
you can live in the dorm.

326
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,660
Then, you don't need to go home.

327
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,700
Isn't that perfect?

328
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,810
Whose side are you on?

329
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,900
Then, you think differently.

330
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,330
A nest of sparrows, for example.

331
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,700
Some sparrow babies are starving

332
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,900
while some can find some food.

333
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,730
When the mother sparrow

334
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,860
comes back with food,

335
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,010
which one will she feed?

336
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,060
Come on.

337
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,220
Sign up and review.

338
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Then you'll succeed.

339
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,020
Can I succeed?

340
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,700
Yes, I'm sure.

341
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,540
As the old saying goes,

342
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,380
when you're good at science,

343
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,740
you'll be able to do anything.

344
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,900
I'll help with your review notes.

345
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,740
(Adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles)

346
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,580
Jiali.

347
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,180
Jiali.

348
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,740
Are you so eager to get a job now?

349
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,220
Let's get up and talk.

350
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,020
Oh, you're back.

351
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,340
I made some chicken soup.

352
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,740
Jiahuan is in for a treat.

353
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,620
You're here, Jianguo.

354
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,540
Jiahuan, sit down.

355
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,340
Jiali,

356
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,380
get bowls for soup.

357
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,740
Glad Jianguo is here.

358
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,140
Let him do a little analysis.

359
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,820
About what?

360
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,500
The job thing.

361
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,740
She can't think it through yet.

362
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,540
Jianguo, listen to this.

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,820
Am I wrong to get a job
and be independent?

364
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,240
Everybody wants me to take Gaokao.

365
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,340
They don't want me to get the job.

366
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,540
You're ambitious.

367
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,940
As excellent as a man.

368
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,780
Ladies in your family

369
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,220
really have ambitions and dreams.

370
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,780
Come on. I want you to analyze

371
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,620
instead of flattering her.

372
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,540
Jiahuan,

373
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,210
have you thought about it?

374
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
How to be independent?

375
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,620
By working and making money.

376
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,900
It makes sense.

377
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,940
When do you think
you can make more money,

378
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,180
now or after you graduate from college?

379
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,260
Jianguo,

380
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,300
do you also advise me to take Gaokao?

381
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,140
Last year, the sister of my comrade

382
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,260
was offered a job

383
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,340
at No. 2 High School
upon her graduation.

384
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,690
She gets a very good pay.

385
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,160
During the school holidays,

386
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,540
she also has time for her hobbies.

387
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,180
No. 2 High School is a great workplace.

388
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,260
Many more young guys

389
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,980
choose to take Gaokao.

390
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,900
Due to reform and opening up,

391
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,980
talents are needed in all walks of life.

392
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,100
Gaokao is strongly advocated.

393
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,380
It offers a chance

394
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,660
for everybody

395
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,420
to see a bigger world.

396
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,370
This is a very meaningful

397
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,940
and valuable thing

398
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,100
to China and its people.

399
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,940
Jiahuan is clever.

400
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,580
She can go to college.

401
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,780
If you want to achieve more,

402
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,700
why not give it a try?

403
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,940
Jianguo is right.

404
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,460
Jiali,

405
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,780
I'll take Gaokao.

406
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,140
Jiali.

407
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
Go ahead.

408
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,300
Have a drumstick.

409
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
It's too hot.

410
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,220
Careful it's hot.

411
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,580
Jiali, don't worry.

412
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,700
I'll work hard.

413
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,580
Ok.

414
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,140
When Jiahuan is back,

415
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,420
be nice to her.

416
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,340
Her bark is worse than her bite.

417
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,340
She gave you such a good job.

418
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,100
You should give her a way out.

419
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm grateful to Jiahuan.

420
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,420
But I don't admit one thing.

421
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,460
What is it?

422
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,490
I'm not naive.

423
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,100
Whether you're naive

424
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,020
isn't a matter of your own will.

425
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,300
Be wise when you behave or say anything.

426
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,260
Jiali,

427
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,820
is that true?

428
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,740
Dad has never liked me.

429
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,180
What did I do wrong?

430
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,100
Mom just complained.

431
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Don't take it personally.

432
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,180
This is just a strategy.

433
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,740
Otherwise,

434
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,020
Jiahuan wouldn't concede.

435
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,940
If you come forward, I'll be rude.

436
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,900
Want to attack me?

437
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,420
Not a chance.

438
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,580
Why? Had a change of heart?

439
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,580
You're my sister.

440
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,340
You'll get soft on me.

441
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,500
You know what?

442
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,900
The bribe won't work on me.

443
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,380
I gave you the job.

444
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,900
But I'll hold a grudge.

445
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,620
Jiahuan,

446
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,100
like Mom said,

447
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,300
I'm naive.

448
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,700
Don't I

449
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,300
deserve some luck?

450
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,380
You aren't naive.

451
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,820
You're just a moocher.

452
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,620
As the old saying goes,

453
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,940
penny wise, pound foolish.

454
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,340
Suffering is a blessing in disguise.

455
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,460
Jiahuan,

456
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,940
you gave me that job.

457
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,020
Will you regret it?

458
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,740
How narrow-minded.

459
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,380
An ordinary girl like you
won't understand me.

460
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,580
I will change my fate with knowledge

461
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,660
and travel around the world.

462
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,340
Jiahuan,

463
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,780
I support you to take Gaokao.

464
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,580
Can't you get ready earlier?

465
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,580
I'm way too excited.

466
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,020
You just can't get up earlier.

467
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,260
Obey your superior when you're at work.

468
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,940
Get along with colleagues.

469
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,620
Talk less, look more, and work more.

470

When you can't do anything,

471
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,460
ask your superior for advice.

472
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,500

473

- Ready?

476
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,500
Got it.

477
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,540
Jiali,

478
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,060
you're starting to sound like Dad.

479
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,900
I should go.

480
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,940

to see me about?

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,380
How's your work lately?

484
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,700
Good.

485
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,380
Did the purchase
from the village go smoothly?

486

Yes.

I'm your master.

488
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,250

489
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
in a different way

490
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,620

00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,580
I want to major in accounting.

568
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,940
But I may estimate a wrong score.

569
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,220
It's ok.

570
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,980
We checked the answers.

571
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,380
You can apply

572
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,540
for CFT.

573
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,380
It's right for you.

574
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
Ok.

575
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
As long as it's in Hefei.

576
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,100
Would you like some?

577
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,820
No. I bought four jin yesterday.

578
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,860
Then, just get to the point.

579
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,980
Prepare for what I will say.

580
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,100
Nothing can scare me.

581
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,260
Jiayi and Ouyang

582
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,900
seem to be together.

583
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,060
Seem?

584
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Then stop them.

585
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,340
Too late.

586
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,620
I'm afraid they're in a relationship.

587
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,460
Did she tell you that?

588
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,660
No. I... I guessed.

589
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,620
That's not good.

590
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,620
Then...

591
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,940
What if they're right for each other?

592
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,780
His father has ten sons.

593
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,140
Such a big family.

594
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,980
It must be complicated.

595
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,850
His mortal quality matters most.

596
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,380
What if Jiayi is cheated?

597
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,480
She...

598
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,180
She won't be cheated.

599
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,860
Before Dad died,

600
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,140
Jiayi had disappeared for some days.

601
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,700
She must have stayed with Ouyang.

602
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,700
So, he's wicked.

603
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,540
We won't accept him.

604
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,900
Mom.

605
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,940
Where's Jiayi?

606
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,020
I think

607
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,620
she's still working.

608
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,140
Mom, I'm afraid Jiayi will have trouble.

609
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,780
Why do you say that again?

610
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,940
Someone saw her in South Market

611
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,340
with a short man

612
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,220
who had acne scars.

613
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,020
- Who's that?
- Who else can it be?

614
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,340
Short.

615
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,740
Acne scars.

616
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,340
It's not that we're snobbish.

617
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,220
But we must avoid the Ouyang Family.

618
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,420
Ouyang?

619
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,380
Who has ten sons?

620
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,380
Mom.

621
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,780
Grandma.

622
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,380
Come over.

623
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,780
Meixin, talk nicely.

624
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,620
What's wrong, Mom?

625
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,980
Get a chair and sit down.

626
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,660
What's wrong with your face?

627
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,940
What a mess.

628
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,180
Your eyelids are even blue.

629
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,860
Mom, this is the latest makeup.

630
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,580
Girls in Guangzhou wear this.

631
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,020
Who do you wear this for in Huainan?

632
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,140
No one.

633
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,910
What's your problem?

634
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,260
Jiayi, we're aware

635
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,940
of what you're doing.

636
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,180
Be specific.

637
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,180
In South Market, you were
with a short man

638
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,460
who had acne scars.

639
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,780
You may go on.

640
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,860
Who told you that?

641
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,820
Jiali?

642
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,860
Glad you know that.

643
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,100
Mind your attitude.

644
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,620
Mom,

645
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,980
I'm an adult now.

646
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,380
I have a job.

647
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,620
I'm no longer a kid.

648
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,540
According to law,

649
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,260
I'm old enough for marriage.

650
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,020
I live my own life,

651
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,880
have my own judgment,

652
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,780
and go my own way.

653
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,020
I'll do this, whether you approve.

654
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,780
I knew Jiali wouldn't talk me up.

655
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Jiayi, life isn't a romantic story.

656
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,180
Don't take a big step
in the wrong direction.

657
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,380
Anyway,

658
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,220
what is done is done.

659
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,460
Don't talk to Grandma like that.

660
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,860
What else do you want?

661
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,780
I turn in my salary every month.

662
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,540
I do everything
even if it's not my duty.

663
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,220
Since I was born,

664
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,580
have you ever fought for me?

665
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,340
Jiali is the eldest daughter.

666
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,580
Jiawen is lucky.

667
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,340
Jiahuan is going to college.

668
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,620
Xiaoling got a lucky break

669
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,860
and took over Dad's good job.

670
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,180
Mom, you brought Jiaxi up personally.

671
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,180
She even had more powdered milk.

672
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,220
What about me?

673
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,300
What did you do for me?

674
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,020
I deserve to be unfortunate!

675
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,220
I always fall behind

676
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,380
and I'm never lucky!

677
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,980
Who wouldn't care for you?

678
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,220
Who got you a job?

679
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,060
Right.

680
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,940
Dad got me a job.

681
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,620
He cared for me.

682
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,780
I was grateful

683
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,980
and I'd do anything for him.

684
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,660
But now, he's gone.

685
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,060
Nobody cares for me anymore.

686
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,220
You ungrateful girl.

687
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,140
Don't be ridiculous.

688
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,780
Who made you and brought you up?

689
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,180
When you were little,
I washed your diapers

690
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,780
and all my fingers

691
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,140
were frozen like carrots.

692
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,100
You didn't only wash my diapers.

693
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,180
Get out of here.

694
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,100
You...

695
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,380
You've lost your mind.

696
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,540
Your tears have stained your face.

697
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,060
It's ok. Have an apple.

698
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,580
Jiayi.

699
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,420
It's your family business.

700
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,740
I can't say who is right.

701
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,180
But remember one thing.

702
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,740
Whatever happens,

703
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,020
I'll always be on your side.

704
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,660
Here.

705
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
Have an apple and calm down.

706
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,620
I don't have a home now.

707
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,020
Then, I'll give you a home.

708
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,340
Oh, Jiayi.

709
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,220
She pissed me off.

710
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,640
Last night, she didn't come back home.

711
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,300
When did you know that?

712
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
Not until recently.

713
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,260
What's your opinion?

714
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,900
Still considering him.

715
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,340
Is that necessary?

716
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
Mom,

717
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,260
you know Jiayi's temper.

718
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,300
She must always be coaxed.

719
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,620
If Ouyang Bao...

720
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,540
His family is poor, indeed.

721
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,100
But if he's dedicated to Jiayi,

722
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,300
that's not a bad thing.

723
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,260
I don't approve.

724
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,500
Not only me,

725
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,060
your dad disapproved when he was alive.

726
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,940
I just continued his vision.

727
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,460
Your dad is gone.
But she can't mess around.

728
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
Jiali,

729
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,660
you're my eldest daughter.

730
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,740
You'll talk to Jiayi on our behalf.

731
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,220
Tell her to break up with him

732
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,890
and come back home.

733
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,660
Ouyang Bao must be

734
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,060
cheating Jiayi.

735
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,100
Mom,

736
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,940
Ouyang is just from a poor family

737
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,500
with some brothers.

738
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,660
Not poor, actually.

739
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,780
Very poor.

740
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,060
Not some brothers.

741
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,220
A lot of brothers.

742
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,500
According to your dad,

743
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,180
our daughters don't need a rich husband.

744
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,220
But they need a suitable match.

745
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,470
Am I right, Grandma?

746
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,620
Jiali,

747
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,780
go talk to Jiayi.

748
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,220
Calm her down.

749
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,820
Don't fiercely oppose.

750
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,220
Don't support her, either.

751
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,180
We'll get her a better boyfriend.

752
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,060
As the old saying goes,

753
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,380
everybody prefers

754
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,620
a better choice.

755
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,660
Now, she's too confused

756
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,620
to see her own advantages.

757
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,740
She has no discretion.

758
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,660
Fine. I get it.

759
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,530
Anybody in?

760
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,980
Who's that?

761
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,380
Is this the He Family?

762
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,740
Yes. Who do you want?

763
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,660
He Jiayi's parent.

764
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,180
I am. And you are?

765
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm Ouyang Bao's father.

766
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,180
Come on in.

767
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,460
I've never come before
and I don't know what to bring.

768
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,590
Is this ok?

769
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,260
You can just talk.

770
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,620
Don't take out the money.

771
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,580
My third son is
in a relationship with Jiayi.

772
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,770
I know.

773
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,060
At first,

774
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,500
I didn't approve, either.

775
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,860
He isn't good enough for Jiayi.

776
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,580
But they're close.

777
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,780
So, I came shamelessly

778
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,140
to beg you for some mercy.

779
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,980
Please let them get married.

780
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,460
In this case,

781
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,220
we were lax with Jiayi.

782
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,860
In the modern society,

783
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,420
all kinds of fashions come in
due to opening up.

784
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,820
Young guys lose their minds.

785
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
They're a couple now,

786
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,980
but they may break up soon.

787
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,780
It's too early for them to get married.

788
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,980
I know you mean well.

789
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,820
But our good intentions

790
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,020
will sometimes

791
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,340
go awry.

792
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,620
What's wrong with you?

793
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,820
Nothing.

794
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,660
Well, madam,

795
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,180
I've never told anyone about this.

796
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,780
I'll only tell you.

797
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,300
I had many diseases
when I worked to support my family.

798
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,900
I don't even know
how much longer I can live.

799
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,020
Go see a doctor, then.

800
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,860
Not all diseases can be cured.

801
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,780
I can just struggle to live.

802
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,740
I know

803
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
my own health conditions.

804
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,380
I'm very satisfied

805
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,420
to have brought up my sons.

806
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,580
Now, my only desire

807
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,500
is that my third son and Jiayi

808
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,060
can live a good life.

809
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,460
I'll talk to her mother when she's back.

810
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,340
Don't be silly, Mom.

811
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,260
How could you agree

812
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,220
to marry Jiayi to him

813
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,820
just because his father begged you?

814
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,860
He gave so little money.

815
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
It's not just about money.

816
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,140
They aren't a perfect couple.

817
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,180
Besides, Changsheng didn't approve.

818
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,780
Stop talking about him.

819
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,060
Don't you know?

820
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,620
The society has changed.

821
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,860
Mom, I know you.

822
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,660
His old, poor father

823
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,620
melted your heart.

824
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,340
If he knocks again,
pretend you can't hear.

825
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,460
The money...

826
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,420
I'll have Jiali send it back.

827
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,420
We won't approve.

828
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,260
What a daughter.

829
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,060
I want my dowry.

830
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,460
What did you say?

831
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,820
I want whatever Jiawen had

832
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,020
when she got married.

833
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,420
We're your daughters.

834
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,660
You must be fair.

835
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,780
Dowry is for marriage.

836
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,540
Why do you want it now?

837
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,580
Yeah.

838
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,780
I'll get married tomorrow.

839
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
Are you insane?

840
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,580
Marriage is no child's play.

841
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,340
How can you get married tomorrow?

842
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,540
I will get married tomorrow.

843
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,980
I've got the letter of approval.

844
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,540
I'm here for two things.

845
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,420
My household register

846
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,580
and my dowry.

847
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,500
Jiayi,

848
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,820
it's not that you can't get married

849
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,180
or you can't marry Ouyang Bao.

850
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,540
But you're a girl.

851
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,340
We don't want you to be cheated.

852
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,460
You're too young.

853
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,380
How about you date him
for a couple of years?

854
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,780
We'll see what to do, ok?

855
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,220
Mom, don't spoil her.

856
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,020
Jiayi, you heard Grandma.

857
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,620
I totally agree.

858
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,100
You'll hold off.

859
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,980
Say no more.

860
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,180
Why?

861
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,220
Why can't I have my dowry?

862
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,740
You aren't married.

863
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,820
We don't admit you'll get married.

864
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
Do you understand?

865
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,620
Dad prepared that.

866
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,980
One for each daughter.

867
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,740
I just want my share.

868
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,900
No.

869
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,420
Jiayi,

870
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,980
apologize to your mother and sister.

871
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,140
You're being so rude.

872
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,580
Grandma, I must get married.

873
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Why?

874
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,140
Disagreed. Denied. Overruled.

875
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,140
This is the decision
of the He Family Council.

876
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,380
You have to obey.

877
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,420
Fine.

878
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,980
I'll give up on my dowry.

879
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,580
Give me my register.

880
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,540
Ungrateful girl,

881
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,860
we told you it was a trap.

882
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,020
Why must you fall for it?

883
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,860
What the heck?

884
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,460
If you only try to fight against us,

885
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,580
this isn't necessary.

886
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,580
Marriage is for a lifetime.

887
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,980
I really don't know

888
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,220
what's wrong with you.

889
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,980
Did Ouyang Bao bewitch you

890
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,980
to get married tomorrow?

891
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,460
What happened?

892
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,260
I...

893
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,220
I...

894
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,380
I'm...

895
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,420
I'm pregnant.
