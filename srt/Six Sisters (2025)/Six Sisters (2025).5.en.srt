15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
Did your mom leave?

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,790
Are you not happy?

17
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,990
The hairpin your mom brought you is nice.

18
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,230
Hairpin?

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,840
You mean this?

20
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,070
Yeah.

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
That's the hairpin.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,630
You're so lucky.

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,000
Your mom showed it to me.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,830
She said it's for your birthday.

25
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,630
You parents aren't here
to keep an eye on you.

26
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,920
It's easy for you to make mistakes.

27
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,170
Old sin makes new shame.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,720
My mom was here.

29
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,390
She saw us.

30
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,290
She left

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,830
this hairpin.

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,600
You mean

33
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,040
she left it on purpose?

34
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,110
I don't know.

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,390
She didn't say it explicitly,

36
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,320
but she dropped hints.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
Does she object to it?

38
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,630
What do you think?

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,920
It's not surprising she's against it.

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,560
Are you

41
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,670
backing out?

42
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,070
What about you?

43
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,760
I swear

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll never change my heart for you.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,350
If I do, may the sky fall on me.

46
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,440
Don't swear.

47
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,390
I mean it to you.

48
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,950
Anyway,

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,550
we're good friends in the village.

50
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,630
We'll stick it out to the end.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,790
What if your mom object to it?

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,880
What if your dad

53
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,230
and your uncles all object to it?

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,390
There's nothing they can do.

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,160
I only want you in my life,

56
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,350
no one else.

57
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,390
What if my dad objects to it?

58
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,200
I'll reason with him.

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,390
Your dad is reasonable.

60
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,550
He isn't always reasonable.

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,600
What are you doing?

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Don't.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
It's ok.

64
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,950
Where there is a will, there is a way.

65
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,760
We'll figure it out together.

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
Good attitude.

67
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,070
Do you know you were wrong?

68
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,670
I wasn't wrong.

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Were you not wrong?

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,190
Where were you when she was fighting?

71
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,110
Weren't you with her?

72
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,600
Dad, she was fighting for our family.

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,040
Is Tang Zhenmin in there?

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,430
- Yes.
- Alone?

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,640
We are counting on you today.

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,630
Rest assured.

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,900
(Men's Room)

78
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,230
You were just keeping watch.

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,120
So what?

80
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,870
Why didn't you go and fight?

81
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,520
You encouraged Jiahuan to fight.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,600
I can't believe

83
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,920
a little girl like you can fight.

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,190
How did you do it?

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,080
I pushed him,

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,230
(Tang Zhenmin, Tang's third son)
and he just fell.

87
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,230
I'll go to your dad to settle the score.

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
Are you smirking?

89
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,040
Do you think it's honorable?

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,750
You can't hit others no matter what.

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
To win credit for your family,

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,230
you must be outstanding.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,920
If all of you are outstanding

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,840
and better than the Tang boys,

95
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,990
you'll win credit for us, right?

96
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,400
The vicious blow

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,310
of our own is worse than our enemies.

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,310
The vicious blow of our own?

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,870
It's the family law.

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,990
When your sisters make mistakes,

101
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,110
they'll get punished.

102
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,710
Moreover,

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,040
you put the washboard here yourself.

104
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,520
Jiahuan, admit your mistake,

105
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,520
or you'll have to kneel on the board.

106
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,720
It hurts.

107
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,040
Dad, I'll learn from my mistakes.

108
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,670
Don't ever hit anyone again.

109
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,230
- Mom.
- You are back.

110
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,080
You are back.

111
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,920
I thought it was serious.

112
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,720
Our daughter has grown up.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,110
She is a big girl.

114
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,520
It's the first awakening of love.

115
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,640
Moreover, your daughter is outstanding.

116
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,920
Isn't it normal for a guy

117
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,280
to fall for her?

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Normal? Do you know who the guy is?

119
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,510
Who?

120
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,840
Tang Weimin.

121
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,520
Don't worry.

122
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,640
Take it easy.

123
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,040
I've been thinking on my way back.

124
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,430
We have to pretend we don't know.

125
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,110
The only way

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,190
is to transfer Jiali back

127
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,640
through your connections.

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,840
Only when she comes back

129
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
and they are farther apart,

130
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,640
will their feelings fade.

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,720
Otherwise, you know what,

132
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,840
if she doesn't come back,

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,230
she might even have a baby.

134
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,160
In a few months, when I go purchase furs,

135
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,190
I'll visit her.

136
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,780
(A few months later)

137
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,600
Jiali, someone is here to see you.

138
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,710
Who?

139
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,510
Dad!

140
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,280
What are you doing here?

141
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,670
I came to purchase furs

142
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,600
in this neighborhood.

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,870
I thought I'd stop by and see you.

144
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,590
Wait for me.

145
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,110
Your dad is so young and handsome.

146
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,950
Hello, sir.

147
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,870
Hello.

148
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,920
Give it to me.

149
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
I'll put it down.

150
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,990
You've got a nice place here.

151
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,860
(Third Production Brigade of Feixi)

152
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,720
This is wool.

153
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,890
Does it fit?

154
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
It fits me well.

155
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,640
Thanks for your expense.

156
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,500
I didn't pay for it.

157
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,350
I made it myself.

158
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,750
- You're kind to bring me presents.
- You know,

159
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,430
these are good furs.

160
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,280
Yeah, sure.

161
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,430
Rabbit fur.

162
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,870
Yeah, very good.

163
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,110
It's windproof and rainproof.

164
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,920
- Gloves.
- Ok.

165
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,990
See if it fits.

166
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,830
Good, good.

167
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,040
It fits.

168
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,640
- Perfect fit.
- Fits, huh?

169
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,040
Don't tell anyone about your return.

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,550
Stay here and work hard for now.

171
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,600
Wait for my news.

172
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,400
Thanks, Dad.

173
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,400
The sooner you get back,

174
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,240
the better.

175
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Captain, thanks for your help.

176
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,000
It's ok.

177
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,550
Sir, give it to me.

178
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,040
No need. We're already here.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,190
Weimin, keep up the good work.

180
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,430
Thanks, sir.

181
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,430
Sir.

182
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,430
What?

183
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
Well...

184
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,240
Dad,

185
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,070
hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.

186
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,590
Stay safe.

187
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,790
Bye.

188
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,430
Stop looking.

189
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,670
There's nothing you can do.

190
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,550
Let's go.

191
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,540
Go back.

192
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,000
Sit tight.

193
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,310
How about

194
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,590
I don't go back now?

195
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,760
Don't be silly.

196
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,430
It's a rare chance to go back to the city.

197
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,120
But leaving you behind

198
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,590
makes me feel like...

199
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,240
Feel like what?

200
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,550
Are you afraid you'll miss me too much?

201
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,550
It's ok. You go back first.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,190
I got a letter from my dad.

203
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,400
He said he's working on it.

204
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll go back soon,

205
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
just a matter of time.

206
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,550
How can your dad

207
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,700
interfere in the village affairs?

208
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,280
No one leaves until the Brigade let them.

209
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,430
Have you heard?

210
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Li Cuidi and Zhang Jian broke up.

211
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,830
You're leaving with all your belongings.

212
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
Leave me a souvenir.

213
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,830
What souvenir?

(He Jiali)

215
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
This?

216
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,430
Don't you want it? Give it back.

217
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,520
I want it.

218
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,040
I should give you mine too.

219
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,030
No need.

220
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,430
Why? Won't you miss me?

221
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,190
I'm going to work in the city.

222
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,760
What if we are exposed?

223
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,790
We can't go underground all the time.

224
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,790
Don't make any trouble.

225
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,160
Early fight, early liberation.

226
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,880
Try to get a job first.

227
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,400
Independence will give us bargaining chips.

Comrade He Jiali,

235
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,470
your writing brings you to life.

236
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,550
I don't know if you'll get this letter.

237
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,120
But I think

238
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,920
it's safer to send it to your workplace
than home.

239
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,280
I'm fine in the village.

240
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,670
Hopefully, I'll be back in town soon.

241
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,190
Look forward to meeting you.

this is my salary.

249
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,760
You've been working hard over the years.

250
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,920
Now I have a job

251
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,760
and can make a little money.

252
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,280
I'll do my part to support our family.

253

254
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,310
Ok, keep it.

255
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,950
You can keep a record for her.

Jiali,

257
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,920
you don't have to give us all of it.

258
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,160
Now that you're making money,

259
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
you'll need to spend it.

260
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,000
Well,

261
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,830

I've seen the file.

304

It's clearly written in it.

305
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,880
He went missing in Shanghai.

306
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,160
Did Mrs. He make that up?

We're not sure.

But disappearance isn't defection.

309
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,470
So, we must stop the He Family

310

When did I say that?

341
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,400
I didn't!

Your mom did!

344
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,990
She represents your position.

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
Let me tell you.

346
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,400
Fighting against the organization

347
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,600
won't bring you any good.

348
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,510

349
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,990
why did your daughter come back early?

350

How did she come back?

351
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,670

360
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,920
asked to see him in the archives.

361
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,840
- Ok, thanks.
- Ok.

363
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,880
why did you have to go through this?

364
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
Just give an explanation.

365
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,640
What do I have to explain?

366
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,120
I have nothing to explain.

367
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,510
Untie me quickly.

368
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,840
You're being tough, huh?

369
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,510
You're not going to talk, huh?

370
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,870
Tang,

371
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,560
you're doing this for private grudges.

372
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,990
I have no grudges against anyone.

(Archives)

374
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,430

with your daughter's early return.

376
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Then let the organization examine it

377
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,190
and deal with it.

378
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,470
You don't represent the organization.

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,120
What are you doing?

381
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,560
Why are you here?

382
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,510
Untie my dad!

383
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,400
Untie him?

384
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,950
Who are you?

385
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,400
Do you think you're a revolutionary youth?

386
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,670
Do you know what trespassing means?

387
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,800
If you don't leave,

388
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,800
I'll arrest you too.

389
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,880
Don't touch my daughter!

390
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,990
- Be good, you go back first.
- Go back.

391
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,430
Leave, go back.

392
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,670
I'll fight you to the death!

393
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,640
Sir, watch out!

394
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,350
Jiali!

395
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,030
What's wrong, Tang?

396
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,880
It hurts.

397
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,670
Where does it hurt?

398
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,880
You're all brawn. Why overreact?

399
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,880
You know what,

400
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,840
our son will be back tomorrow.

401
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,670
When he is back, you'll feel perfect.

402
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,120
Tomorrow?

403
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,440
What's wrong now?

404
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,190
My chest hurts.

405
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,870
Where else?

406
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
My head.

407
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,880
Is it a concussion?

408
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,230
Oh, my.

409
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,400
My ears are buzzing.

410
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,030
Is it a perforated eardrum?

411
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,270
Don't be dramatic.

412
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,840
It's just a scratch.

413
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,030
Internal injury.

414
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,920
Let's go to the hospital.

415
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
(Ward 7)

416
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,470
Weimin, you're finally home.

417
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,310
What happened to Dad?

418
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,300
(Tang Youmin, Tang's second son)
We're being bullied.

419
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
Weimin!

420
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,230
Finally, you're back,

421
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,070
Weimin.

422
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,990
Look at your dad.

423
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,470
Our dad was beaten up.

424
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
Our brother was bullied too.

425
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,880
He Jiali is good.

426
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,400
He Jiahuan is a real devil.

427
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,640
She is stronger than a man.

428
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,270
Did Jiahuan beat you?

429
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,230
She's not even close to me.

430
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,670
Shut up.

431
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,470
Stop playing the hero.

432
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,800
When your brother was beaten,

433
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,640
where were you?

434
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,840
Weimin, do avenge your dad and brother.

435
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
What did we do wrong?

436
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,080
Just because your dad is his superior,

437
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,880
they are so jealous that they won't

438
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,430
stand anything good happening to us.

439
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,840
Mom, it isn't that serious.

440
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,030
Why isn't it?

441
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,120
It's very serious.

442
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,640
He's got six daughters.

443
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,800
I've got three precious sons.

444
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,430
He is jealous of us.

445
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,990
Want to get up?

446
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,560
Come on.

447
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,710
Easy, easy.

448
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,270
Boys,

449
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,600
Dad's getting old

450
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
and useless.

451
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,190
I can't protect you anymore.

452
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,840
I've been dealing with pigs all my life,

453
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,430
but I never thought

454
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,750
I'd be beaten like a pig.

455
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,230
I'm a loser.

456
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,320
Anyone can bully our family.

457
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
Dad, valor runs in the blood.

458
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,800
My big brother is back.

459
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,320
- We're not afraid of anyone.
- Don't fan the flames.

460
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,670
Do you want more trouble?

461
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,840
Weimin, it's time for you to get a job

462
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
and hold up our family.

463
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,190
The future of our family

464
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,670
depends on you.

465
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,120
How's your job going?

466
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,470
Where are you going to work?

467
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,430
The First Pharmaceutical Factory.

468
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,230
Help your dad lie down.

469
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,510
Easy, easy.

470
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,400
Big Tang was said to act for a just cause.

471
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,840
He got hurt helping someone.

472
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,680
What?

473
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,190
Don't move.

474
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,230
Don't move!

475
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,800
Is there any justice here?

476
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,030
I'm going to reason with them.

477
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,870
What's wrong?

478
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,640
We didn't do anything wrong.

479
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,600
Big Tang, and my dad...

480
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,400
What did he do to your dad?

481
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,840
He tied Dad's hands with a rope

482
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,120
and stopped him from leaving.

483
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,400
Does the law mean nothing?

484
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,670
I'm going to see their superiors.

485
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,550
Meixin.

486
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,590
Go.

487
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,320
I'll beat you.

488
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,440
Beat.

489
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,830
Wait for me.

490
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,710
Jiawen,

491
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,210
light the lamp.

492
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
Bring me the kerosene lamp.

493
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,960
Okay.

494
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,880
It's hot in here. Why don't you go out?

495
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,840
It's ok. I'll stay here with you.

496
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,800
No need.

497
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,670
Take the girls to the dam to cool off.

498
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,270
Go ahead, take a walk.

499
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,270
Leave the door open.

500
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,270
I want some air.

501
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,310
Okay.

502
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,230
Play with fire, and you'll wet the bed.

503
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,840
Don't run. I won't beat you.

504
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,270
(Tang Zhenmin, Tang's third son)
You can't beat me.

505
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,750
Stop fighting all the time.

506
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,080
Let's play a game.

507
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,130
(Zhang Qiulin)
What game?

508
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,190
We can play "Blind Man's Bluff".

509
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,230
Blow out the light.

510
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,880
My mom won't let me.

511
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,600
You always listen to your mom.

512
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,560
Why don't we go to our house?

513
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,790
Okay.

514
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,990
- Let's go.
- Go.

515
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,350
It's not cold.

516
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,640
Who's there?

517
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,670
It's me.

518
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,270
What are you doing here?

519
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,120
I came to see you.

520
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,030
What can you see in the dark?

521
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,230
I need to know that you're ok.

522
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,320
I'm ok.

523
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,870
Does it hurt?

524
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,510
No.

525
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,960
Jiali.

526
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,480
Here, here.

527
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,960
Jiali.

528
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,830
Jiali.

529
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,430
It's so dark in here.

530
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,080
The power's out.

531
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,470
Come on, I've got you a candle.

532
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,320
No, Mom, don't waste it.

533
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,430
The power will be back soon.

534
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,880
It's too dark.

535
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
It's ok.

536
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,070
No, no.

537
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,230
Too dark.

538
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,120
What's there?

539
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,190
Got you!

540
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,590
Who is it?

541
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,920
What? Who are you?

542
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,840
Tang Zhenmin, what are you doing here?

543
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,840
Got the wrong one.

544
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,190
Did you hurt yourself?

545
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,430
I'm not going to eat you.

546
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,470
What are you doing in our house?

547
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,350
It hurts.

548
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,760
Go home.

549
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,830
Who?

550
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,080
Who's in your bed?

551
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,360
He, he is...

552
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Get out!

553
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,960
Well...

554
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,710
Meixin.

555
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
Weimin.

556
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,840
Go.

557
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,430
- Mom, no...
- He Jiali,

558
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,800
shame on you!

559
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,270
Let's see how your dad will fix you!

560
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,380
(State Run Muslim Restaurant)

561
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,030
Do you want Jiali to have a good life?

562
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,560
Yes.

563
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,070
Then you

564
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,710
should cut her off.

565
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,920
Weimin, our families

566
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,360
are on such bad terms.

567
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,470
What future

568
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,950
will you have with Jiali?

569
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,600
If you want Jiali to be with you,

570
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,560
Jiali has to break up with her family

571
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,990
and you have to break up with yours.

572
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,120
Can you do that?

573
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,190
You can't, right?

574
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,750
Don't let me down.

575
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,560
You should

576
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,750
think about Jiali

577
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,710
and her happiness,

578
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,550
understand?

579
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,580
(Two months later)

580
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,200
Are you ok?

581
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,590
Yes.

582
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,560
What happened exactly?

583
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,950
Let bygones be bygones.

584
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,470
Anyway,

585
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,270
you shouldn't have fought.

586
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,120
Are you here to settle scores with me?

587
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,800
It must be a misunderstanding.

588
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,920
It isn't.

589
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,510
Your dad tortured my dad.

590
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,410
I found out about it.

591
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,360
Then there was an accident.

592
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,200
It's simple.

593
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,120
What do you think?

594
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,030
About what?

595
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,440
About us.

596
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,320
It's impossible.

597
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,710
Don't you even give it a try?

598
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm keeping it a secret.

599
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,020
My dad doesn't know it yet.

600
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,160
I told Zhenmin too.

601
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,320
My parents don't know either.

602
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,800
It's better sooner than later.

603
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
Let's take precautions before it's too late.

604
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,800
What do you mean?

605
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,600
We'd better go our separate ways.

606
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,600
Jiali, I don't think you mean it.

607
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
We agreed in the village.

608
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,800
Why did you suddenly change?

609
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,190
It's not my fault.

610
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,710
Can't you see

611
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,750
what's going on right now?

612
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,030
I don't have confidence in our future.

613
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,800
We should draw a lesson from the pain.

614
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Better sooner than later.

615
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,320
We should make up our minds

616
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,160
to strive for our happiness.

617
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,600
I'll handle your family's objections.

618
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,440
You can't.

619
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,120
My feelings for you have never changed.

620
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,100
(Develop the economy. Serve the people)

621
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,340

623
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,120
Check it out.

624
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,110
Okay.

625
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,220
That one.

626
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,810
Thanks.

627
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,230
Come again.

628
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,070
Okay.

629
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,470
Comrade.

630
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,390
What can I get you?

631
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,030
Finally, you're back.

632
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,360
I've missed you.

633
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,110
Come on, the three of us

634
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,200
reunited.

635
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,830
What's wrong?

636
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,150
Nothing.

637
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,580
(Rabbit Soap)

638
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,280
You got paid?

639
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,070
It's from my workplace.

640
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,720
What's your plan for tomorrow's day off?

641
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,070
I haven't figured it out yet.

642
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,950
I'm upset.

643
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,520
Don't be.

644
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,880
Let's go swimming.

645
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,560
Swimming?

646
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,120
When did you learn to swim?

647
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,260
When I wasn't busy with farm work,

648
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,950
I went to the Huai River with the guys

649
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,400
to catch fish and swim.

650
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,730
But you can swim across the Huai River.

651
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,480
You can almost cross the Yangtze River.

652
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,320
Give me back my soap.

653
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,360
How do I look?

654
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,240
Pretty good.

Director.

664
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,430
Have you signed up for the Variety Show

665
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,600
to commemorate Chairman Mao?

666
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes.

667
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,000
Participation is important.

668
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,240
For the honor of our factory.

669
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,920
- Yes.
- Practice hard.

670

I will.

No one is singing Pioneer Siblings with me.

679
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,910
Wait.

680
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,240
Be quiet, everyone.

681
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,150
Who sings Pioneer Siblings well?

682
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,840
We need a girl.

683
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,680
You can sing it.

684
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,880
He Jiali can sing it.

685
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,720
- Go ahead.
- I...

686
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
Can you sing it?

687
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,110
I can.

688
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,020
But...

689
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,760
It's for the organization. No excuse.

691
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,680
You two, give it a try.

692
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,520
Sing it.

693
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,310
Come on, then.

694
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,060
(Blessings)

695
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,910

Where is the little one?

697
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:55,950
She's asleep.

698
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,590
Do you know your eldest daughter

699
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
is going to perform on the stage?

700
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,110
The Variety Show organized

701
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,470
by the district government?

702
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,240
Good thing.

703
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,510
What's her show?

704
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,630
Pioneer Siblings.

705
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,240
I don't know if she can do that.

706
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,430
Let's go and take a look then.

707
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,800
Do you know who she will perform with?

708
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,950
Who?

709
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,200
Tang Weimin.

710
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,320
Looks like they didn't break up.

711
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,800
I'm telling you, no way!

712
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:25,990
When their show

713
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,320
is staged at the Huaibin Theater,

714
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,280
everyone will know

715
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
that they are a couple.

716
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,070
That's not true.

717
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,720
It's Pioneer Siblings.

718
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,320
They are playing siblings.

719
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,110
People won't think they are a couple.

720
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,990
You're thinking too much.

721
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,920
They're siblings in the show,

722
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,280
but what about outside the show?

723
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,800
They rehearse together every day,

724
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
right? They'll be singing, dancing,

725
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
and cuddling.

726
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,720
Who knows what will happen?

727
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,950
Do something.

728
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,880
What should we do?

729
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,680
Why don't we talk to their superiors?

730
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,990
Director, I really can't go.

731
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,280
I have to perform

732
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
in the district's Variety Show.

733
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,550
You should look at the big picture.

734
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,780
You're the only woman who can swim

735
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,000
across the Huai River.

736
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,360
- But...
- No but.

737
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,880
It's a deal.

738
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,320
There are plenty of people who can sing.

739
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,410
You can leave now.

740
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,880
Pioneer Siblings.

741
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,720
Without the sister, what can the brother do?

742
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,200
Without this sister,

743
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,280
you'll get another sister.

744
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,800
Do you really not know what I mean?

745
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
The organization has other plans.

746
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,950
I'll ask Qiufang.

747
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,860
One, two, three, four.

748
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,100
Five, six, seven, eight.

749
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Two, two, three...

750
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,500
(Locker Room)

751
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,510
I'll get changed first.

752
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,350
Okay.

753
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,800
How are you getting ready?

754
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,600
She's almost done.

755
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,590
We'll be ready in a minute.

756
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,030
Why don't you go wait by the door?

757
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,040
