Congratulations, Jiawen.

00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,860
Here, sausage.

17
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,220
Good job, Jiaxi.

18
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,620
That's all I can do.

19
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,460
Well done.

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,940
Jiali, do you need help?

21
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,860
No, I'm ok.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
Chicken soup's ready.

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,660
This is hot.

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,220
- Thanks, Jiali.
- Don't mention it.

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,140
Jianguo,

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,060
give me your drink.

27
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,980
Fan, I'll toast to you.

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,980
Best wishes on your marriage!

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,140
Thanks, Jiali.

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,460
Look after her, will you?

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,340
Rest assured.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,450
Suit yourself.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,300
I'll drink up.

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,060
Jiali is still so free and easy.

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,540
You are probably

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,460
no match for her in terms of drinking.

37
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,660
Yeah, if a woman raises her glass...

38
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,700
My glass.

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,340
Sorry about that.

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,740
Jianguo,

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,340
I'd like to drink to you too.

42
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,940
When you retire,

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,580
you'll be at the regiment level, right?

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,060
I'll take it as it comes

45
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,500
and follow the organization's arrangements.

46
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,220
Come on. Congratulations.

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,820
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

48
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,900
- Wish you a happy marriage.
- Thanks.

49
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,330
- He is your brother-in-law now.
- Yes.

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,700
Second brother-in-law.

51
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,300
Uncle.

52
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,820
- Thanks.
- Jiawen.

53
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,820
Don't you think

54
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,260
you owe the matchmaker a gift?

55
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,860
Thank you.

56
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,380
Wish you a happy marriage.

57
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
- How is the food?
- Very good.

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,980
Welcome to join our family.

59
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,620
I'm going to toast Mom.

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,820
Go ahead.

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,620
Jiawen.

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,460
Mom, we'd like to toast you.

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,660
Yes, Mom.

64
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,220
Mom? It makes my head spin

65
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,420
just listening to it.

66
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,260
He doesn't look much younger than Mom.

67
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,380
Cherish each other.

68
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
Really.

69
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,900
- Thanks, Mom.
- Grow old together.

70
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,220
Slow down.

71
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,180
Don't drink too much.

72
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm ok.

73
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,060
How old is this guy?

74
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,220
About 10 years older than Jiawen.

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,220
Is she really into this old goat?

76
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,980
Stop it.

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,740
Let's raise our glasses together.

78
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,540
Is your bathhouse still not doing well?

79
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,260
It'll last till the end of the year at most.

80
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,900
Still, you're doing better than me.

81
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,300
Wish the new couple a happy marriage.

82
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,740
Thank you, everyone.

83
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,140
Thanks, Jiali. Thanks, everyone.

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,660
- Good.
- Thanks.

85
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,860
Thanks.

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,340
To Aunt and Uncle.

87
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,620
Happy marriage!

88
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,420
Thanks, thanks.

89
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,140
Why don't you do cross-arm drinking?

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,540
- Yes!
- We just...

91
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,060
Cross-arm drinking!

92
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,820
Ok, come on.

93
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,820
Come on.

94
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,090
- Great.
- Good!

95
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,380
- Congratulations.
- Slow down.

96
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,820
Thanks.

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,030
- I can't drink anymore.
- Congratulations.

98
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,900
(Seasonal Sale)

99
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,900
Right now, I am

100
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,780
in the toughest situation.

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,500
Even Jiawen is doing better than me.

102
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,780
My store

103
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,100
is losing money every day.

104
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,860
Your store is too big,

105
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,780
Jiaxi.

106
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,620
You...

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,380
Why don't you close it?

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,500
Then I'll lose more money!

109
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,100
I've paid the rent in advance.

110
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,580
Whether I do it or not,

111
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,980
the money will go out.

112
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,340
But Hongyu and I

113
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,860
aren't going to rent the flat any more.

114
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,860
Where are you going to live?

115
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,140
Back to the tiger's den.

116
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,140
Wang Huaimin's place?

117
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Slow down.

118
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,500
I told you to carry one.

119
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,340
You had to carry two.

120
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,380
Moving is exhausting.

121
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,860
Don't be upset. I think it's good.

122
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,460
Moving back will save us money.

123
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,860
The monthly rent

124
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,940
is a lot of money.

125
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,700
Saving, saving, it could be a trap.

126
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,500
Wait and see.

127
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,860
We may not save money by moving back.

128
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Also, my store...

129
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,980
Don't mention it again.

130
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,860
If it keeps losing,

131
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,860
it has to be closed

132
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,780
by the end of the year.

133
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,900
My hand hurts.

134
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,420
- You guys...
- Mom.

135
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,260
Are you done moving?

136
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,540
Done.

137
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,060
You're not moving out again, right?

138
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,900
No.

139
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
I miss Mom.

140
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,580
You're so sweet.

141
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,860
Don't try to cozy up to me.

142
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,780
Just admit you're broke.

143
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
What's the big deal about being poor?

144
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,300
We can live within our means.

145
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,060
I used to be poor too,

146
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,700
but I tightened my belt

147
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
and still raised the three of you boys.

148
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
You have to be practical.

149
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,380
Yes, Mom's right.

150
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,480
Mom, I got you two more dresses

151
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,740
and put them in the closet downstairs.

152
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,100
I wouldn't dare to wear the dresses

153
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,700
in your store.

154
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,540
They're all black and white.

155
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,300
They'll make me look like a jinx

156
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,180
and lose every game of mahjong.

157
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,060
Grandma,

158
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,780
they are waiting for you to play mahjong.

159
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,700
Ok, let's go play.

160
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,140
Yan Xiaoman!

161
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,940
Come back!

162
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,460
Even in a thousand years,

163
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,980
she can't change her unreliable ways.

164
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,820
- It's done.
- Ok.

165
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,140
(Household)
Xiaoman's registration is done.

166
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,860
You can take this to enroll her in school.

167
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,140
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

168
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,660
- Ok.
- Great.

169
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,940
Now we're relieved.

170
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,380
Let's go.

171
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
(Strict enforcement, Uphold justice)

172
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,940
We have many members in our house now.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Your registration has been transferred out,

174
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,100
but Xiaoling's is still there.

175
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,180
Didn't Xiaoling buy an apartment?

176
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
She can transfer hers out too.

177
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,300
But she has to come back first.

178
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,580
I'll unlock my bike.

179
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,780
I'll go to the office to get my paycheck

180
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,300
and then go to Xiaoling's.

181
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,020
The property management asked me

182
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,900
to pick up her water card.

183
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,460
It's not the same direction.

184
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,820
Yes, Jiali.

185
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,700
Give us the key to Xiaoling's place.

186
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,300
We'll handle it. You go get your paycheck.

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,260
It's important.

188
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
Ok.

189
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,900
Give me the key.

190
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,940
Do you know the way?

191
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,260
Yes, we'll take care of it.

192
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,060
- Mom, I'm going to work.
- Ok.

193
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,260
Bye, Jiali, Jiawen.

194
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,180
(Yanhuai Police Station, Tianjia'an Branch,
Huainan Public Security Bureau)

195
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,580
Come on in, Mom. It's cold.

196
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,140
Is there a light?

197
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,260
Is this it?

198
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,660
Oh, my!

199
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,660
Oh, my!

200
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,500
Mom,

201
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,860
is this a palace?

202
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,460
Is it newly decorated?

203
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,660
Is all the furniture new?

204
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,980
The apartment is second-hand,

205
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,580
but the furniture is new.

206
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,660
Look at this bathroom.

207
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,180
It's bigger than my bedroom.

208
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,740
Mom, look.

209
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,220
Look at the bedroom.

210
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,740
There's a bathroom inside.

211
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,660
Yes.

212
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,780
Oh, my gosh!

213
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,660
I've only seen such a sofa

214
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,860
at the mall before.

215
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,780
My gosh!

216
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,380
Is this the kitchen?

217
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,660
Mom!

218
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,820
Mom, look!

219
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,140
Mom.

220
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,860
It's so soft.

221
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,420
Be careful not to ruin it.

222
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,660
Alright, don't be jealous.

223
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,100
Everyone has their own destiny.

224
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,340
You hear me?

225
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,380
Mom.

226
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,100
I just feel sorry for you.

227
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,020
She bought such a nice apartment.

228
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,620
Why didn't she think of you

229
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,020
and let you enjoy it too?

230
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,540
I

231
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
am old.

232
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,540
I don't like living in such a big apartment.

233
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,860
It's desolate and cold.

234
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Besides,

235
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,620
east or west, home is best.

236
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,060
When I said I wanted to go into business,

237
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
you wouldn't let me.

238
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,020
If I'd gone into business,

239
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,820
I'd be living in a big apartment like this.

240
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,300
I can also be carefree and enjoy myself.

241
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,100
Even if you had,

242
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,220
you might not get an apartment like this.

243
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,340
Mom,

244
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,780
skills, looks, and insights,

245
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,020
I've got everything Xiaoling has.

246
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,020
Do you know how she got this apartment?

247
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,220
I shouldn't have got married so early.

248
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,160
Hongyu is a good man.

249
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,900
You should lead a tranquil life with him.

250
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Do you understand?

251
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
Yes, yes, yes.

252
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,500
Sit.

253
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,820
Mom,

254
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,020
you've lived for a long time.

255
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,460
But why can't you see things clearly?

256
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,580
What's the point of life?

257
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,860
Isn't it about enjoyment?

258
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,820
Look at you.

259
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,660
You're living such a frugal life.

260
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,380
Why are you doing this?

261
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,020
I feel sorry for you.

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
It's soft.

263
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,620
Here is your drumstick.

264
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,420
One more drumstick and stir-fried beancurd.

265
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,260
Yes.

266
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,500
Enjoy your meal.

267
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,300
It's being late.

268
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,220
Why isn't mom home yet?

269
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,100
If you're hungry, eat first.

270
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
I'll wait for her.

271
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,820
- You're back.
- Mom, you're back.

272
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,700
Have you got the water card?

273
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,620
Yes.

274
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,100
What took you so long?

275
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,260
Are you hungry?

276
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,580
You don't have to serve me.

277
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,180
Have you eaten?

278
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,940
I'm not hungry.

279
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,900
Mom, grab a bite.

280
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,660
Don't upset your stomach.

281
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,460
Buns and congee again.

282
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,620
Grandma can only eat these,

283
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,780
or noodles.

284
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,380
Your grandma can't eat other food,

285
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,260
but your mom can.

286
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,060
And Jianguo, too.

287
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,100
Right, Jianguo?

288
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,900
- Yes.
- This is how ordinary life is.

289
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,580
Do you want a big meal at night?

290
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,420
It's not that exaggerated.

291
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,780
But this looks plain and tasteless.

292
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,220
I'll go buy some pot-stewed meat.

293
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,220
No need.

294
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,380
You guys eat.

295
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,220
I'm going to bed.

296
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,860
Wonton.

297
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,900
Drumstick.

298
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,060
And cilantro.

299
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,180
Shall we eat out too?

300
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
Just kidding.

301
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,100
Look, Mom, is my painting good?

302
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,020
Sure.

303
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,100
- This is a red lotus flower.
- Yes.

304
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,580
Any other colors?

305
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,380
Pink.

306
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,220
Yes.

307
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,860
- And blue.
- Yes.

308
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,900
- Jiaxi.
- And white.

309
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,500
Come over here.

310
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,220
Let Xiaoman paint by herself.

311
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,540
Xiaoman, you paint for a while.

312
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,580
Sit up straight.

313
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,860
Mom.

314
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,500
I have something to tell you both.

315
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,420
I have no problem with you moving back.

316
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,180
Since you moved back,

317
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,420
our water meter

318
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,100
has been spinning too fast.

319
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,620
It's been just a few days.

320
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,220
You already used a ton of water.

321
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,380
What have you done?

322
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,860
You don't have very big faces

323
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,020
or butts.

324
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,900
Why use so much water to clean them?

325
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,140
Mom, we probably

326
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
have done too much laundry lately.

327
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,620
How about this?

328
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,020
We'll pay this month's water bill.

329
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,700
Yeah, I'll go pay it.

330
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,060
Don't worry about it, Mom.

331
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,940
Still,

332
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,420
that's our money.

333
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,660
It's not about who pays,

334
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
but the principle of diligence and frugality.

335
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,620
You are parents too.

336
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,260
Set a good example for your daughter.

337
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,700
Don't waste anything.

338
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,220
No big deal.

339
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,100
You know what,

340
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,260
if we pay the water bill,

341
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,820
even if we use thousands of tons,

342
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,300
your mom won't say a word.

343
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
It's ok.

344
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Don't think too much.

345
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,300
Mom sticks to her old habits

346
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,980
because she's been through the hard times.

347
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,020
I can understand that.

348
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,100
Let's get back to painting, Xiaoman.

349
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,700
Is Feng asleep?

350
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,500
Yes.

351
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,900
Honey,

352
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,940
I've checked our accounts.

353
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,500
It doesn't look good.

354
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,140
I know.

355
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,100
We've suffered a loss

356
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,660
of half of our money.

357
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,980
Not too bad.

358
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,900
We still have the other half.

359
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,300
We have to consume coal every day,

360
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,900
but there are few customers.

361
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,740
It really drives me crazy.

362
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,620
Look, I've got a boil.

363
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
Don't worry.

364
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,660
It's ok.

365
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,020
We should at least

366
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,020
invite Mom and Grandma to take a bath.

367
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,100
Yeah, they didn't come when we opened.

368
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,500
Now we're closing down.

369
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,940
They should enjoy themselves once.

370
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Honey, it's ok.

371
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
It's normal to have losses

372
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,340
and gains in business.

373
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,060
Do you think

374
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,300
we can make a comeback?

375
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,220
With you by my side,

376
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,660
I'm sure we can.

377
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,260
I have faith.

378
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,620
Mom, are you ready?

379
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,660
We're all waiting for you.

380
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,260
Got it.

381
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,100
Coming.

382
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,860
If you don't come, I'll turn off the boiler.

383
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,980
Can we still take a bath?

384
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
If not,

385
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,980
we'll just head back home.

386
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,140
Yes, definitely.

387
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,900
- Definitely.
- Mom!

388
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,940
Coming.

389
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,420
- Coming.
- Coming.

390
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,740
Why are you taking a washboard?

391
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,620
You've been stalling.

392
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,500
Finally, we can go for a free bath.

393
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,700
I'll take something to wash.

394
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,220
You're our only guests today.

395
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,940
We've got the fruit ready for you.

396
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,140
Your mom is thrifty.

397
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Mom, you've talked about taking a bath.

398
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
But why did you come out

399
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,940
in less than 10 minutes?

400
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,540
I haven't finished my laundry yet.

401
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,080
It's suffocating.

402
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,980
Do you feel suffocated?

403
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,540
Meixin, I'm done.

404
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,380
You go ahead.

405
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,380
- Ok.
- Go. I'll stay with Mrs. He.

406
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,500
- Go ahead.
- Are you sure you're ok?

407
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,650
- Then I'll go.
- Hurry. Don't catch a cold.

408
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,820
- You're not wearing much.
- I'm going.

409
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,660
I'm going now.

410
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,180
Ms. Liu, thank you.

411
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,140
You're welcome.

412
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,980
You're lucky

413
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,140
to have such a good daughter-in-law.

414
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,940
If I had such a daughter-in-law,

415
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,420
I'd wake up laughing in my dreams.

416
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,340
Be careful.

417
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,540
Meixin is

418
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,140
really good.

419
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,780
Ms. Liu, have an orange.

420
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,540
Mrs. He, you're good to her too.

421
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,820
You two are like mother and daughter.

422
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,340
Ms. Liu, Meixin fell!

423
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,820
- Come over!
- I'll go check on her.

424
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,980
Meixin!

425
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,580
What happened?

426
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,540
Hello, Jiali.

427
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,420
Mom,

428
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,020
what happened?

429
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,780
She fell in the bathhouse.

430
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,220
Where did she get hurt?

431
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,180
Is it serious?

432
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,220
Fractured pelvis.

433
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,580
She needs to stay in bed.

434
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,020
Mom, you're so...

435
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,300
Does it hurt?

436
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,180
It's my fault.

437
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,980
What should we do, Jiali?

438
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,660
What do you mean?

439
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,420
Mom can't move at all.

440
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,700
She needs someone to take care of her.

441
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
I am taking care of her.

442
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,730
You have to take care of Grandma

443
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,620
and Mom at the same time.

444
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,620
It's too much work.

445
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,580
It's a big deal that she hurt her pelvis.

446
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,420
What do you think we should do?

447
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,820
I thought we could

448
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,060
take turns taking care of them

449
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,100
for a month each.

450
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,380
We'll get by in six months.

451
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,700
You all have plenty of things to do.

452
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,700
No, I will

453
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,020
stay home and rest. I'll get well.

454
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,060
Jiayi,

455
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,580
you should take some responsibility.

456
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,300
Mom fell in your bathhouse.

457
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,380
What do you mean, Jiaxi?

458
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,660
I invited Mom out of good intentions,

459
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,580
- Stop blaming each other.
- but she fell...

460
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,660
Let's pay for a domestic helper

461
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,820
and Jiali can keep an eye on her.

462
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,820
I don't want a helper.

463
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,860
A helper is an outsider.

464
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,500
I don't feel at ease at home with them.

465
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,980
Let's not worry about that now.

466
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,420
The problem is where to find

467
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,180
a good helper in such a short time?

468
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,540
Jiaxi,

469
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,620
how about this?

470
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,420
Didn't you close your store?

471
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
Why don't you move back home?

472
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,020
Stay with me for a few months, ok?

473
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,780
Sure, of course.

474
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
I can contribute effort.

475
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,980
We will chip in.

476
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,500
You won't suffer any losses.

477
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,700
Next month,

478
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,620
I will no longer work in the district.

479
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,820
What do you mean?

480
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,700
The organization approved me

481
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,820
to work for the Bureau of Retired Cadres.

482
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,820
I'll officially resign from the leading post.

483
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,660
Don't feel bad.

484
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,460
It's for the good of our son.

485
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,780
Besides, you'll resign sooner or later.

486
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,700
I'm ok.

487
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,100
Didn't we agree?

488
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,180
As long as we do our duty for our son,

489
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,180
we'll have no regrets.

490
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
What about the housing?

491
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,580
We can exchange this

492
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
for a three-bedroom apartment.

493
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,020
Parents do everything for their children.

494
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,500
You should move back tomorrow.

495
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,540
Why?

496
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,020
Mom fell

497
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,860
and Jiaxi is moving in to take care of her.

498
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,660
Does her conscience awaken

499
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,100
and remind her of taking care of her mom?

500
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,900
Mom suggested it.

501
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,660
Is Mom unhappy with our work?

502
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,620
She didn't say that.

503
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,620
But she raised Jiaxi with her own hands.

504
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,860
They are close. Besides,

505
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,300
she's been free since her store was closed.

506
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,500
Also, I have to take care of Grandma.

507
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,780
She can take some of my pressure off.

508
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,220
The more help, the better.

509
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,700
I can see Grandma's energy

510
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,020
fading day by day.

511
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,260
So this year,

512
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,860
we've got to make her birthday special.

513
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,500
She's almost 90 years old.

514
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,420
She's a living history book.

515
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,420
Your family has a longevity gene.

516
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,380
Hi.

517
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,220
Where's Mom?

518
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,340
In her room.

519
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,420
Mom, I'm coming!

520
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,420
Mom, don't stay in the same position.

521
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,660
Doesn't anyone help you move?

522
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,420
It's ok.

523
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,020
She can't move.

524
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,620
She can't move her hips,

525
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,860
but you should rub her arms and legs

526
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,920
to maintain blood circulation.

527
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,580
It's ok. I can't move.

528
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,420
Are you feeling better?

529
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,380
I'm ok.

530
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,220
Jiali, may I have a word with you?

531
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,460
Jiali,

532
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,620
don't take offence.

533
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
What's wrong?

534
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,620
This is a critical phase for Mom.

535
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,700
Seniors' bone healing is slow.

536
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,420
A nutrient-rich diet is necessary.

537
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,860
Yes.

538
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,820
I think her meals

539
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,620
should be specially tailored,

540
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,980
like those in postnatal recovery.

541
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,020
Eating together is not suitable.

542
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,620
Separate meals would be best.

543
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
You have your meals,

544
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,750
and Mom will have hers separately.

545
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,700
If you think it's good for her recovery,

546
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
I have no problem with it.

547
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Our resources are limited.

548
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,180
This is the only way.

549
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,660
Please be understanding, Jiali.

550
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,620
I totally understand.

551
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,020
Do whatever you should.

552
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,620
I'll go in and check on her.

553
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,460
By the way, your housing matter is settled.

554
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,780
Really?

555
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,860
Longhu Community.

556
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,820
A three-bedroom apartment.

557
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,860
Did you buy it?

558
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,540
Your dad resigned from the leading post

559
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,820
to work for the Bureau of Retired Cadres.

560
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,260
His work unit replaced it for him.

561
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,100
So he can't get a rank of regiment?

562
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,260
Didn't Dad always want

563
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,860
to retire at the rank of regiment?

564
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,420
Isn't it because you're rushing into marriage

565
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,500
and shoving the housing problem

566
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,820
in our faces?

567
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,860
What's a real father and son?

568
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,060
A father's love is genuine.

569
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,260
You should keep that in mind.

570
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,010
As long as you and Li Wen

571
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,650
build a happy life together,

572
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,330
your dad's sacrifices will be worth it.

573
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,640
Do you hear me?

574
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,810
Listen.

575
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,780
Did you hear that?

576
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,100
Here, be careful.

577
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,940
Jiali

578
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,300
meddles too much.

579
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,340
She wants to control everything.

580
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,740
But if she hadn't,

581
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,100
wouldn't this family have fallen apart?

582
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,260
Times have changed.

583
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,220
Her control worked in the old days.

584
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,460
It was the planned economy era.

585
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,620
But we're in a market economy now.

586
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,900
Is it appropriate for her to meddle?

587
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,420
Forget about us.

588
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,620
Her son is at the age

589
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,740
of starting his own family.

590
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,940
Everyone has their own way of living.

591
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,300
What can she do?

592
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,460
She can do nothing.

593
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,180
Come on.

594
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,580
No more.

595
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,420
No more?

596
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,700
Do you watch the black-and-white TV

597
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,340
and they watch the color one?

598
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,660
I'm used to it.

599
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,020
Go and tap it.

600
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,900
It is always on the fritz.

601
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
I'll swap them later

602
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,700
and let the couple watch this one

603
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,600
and you watch the color one.

604
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
No, this one is fine.

605
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,140
Color TVs strain the eyes.

606
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,100
Oh, my dear mom.

607
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,900
When are you going to

608
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,180
fight for yourself?

609
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,540
You've sacrificed for decades.

610
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,380
Now it's your time to say,

611
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,220
"I deserve to enjoy life,"

612
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,500
and no one would dare say no.

613
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,660
Jiawen,

614
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,300
did you take my money?

615
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,620
What?

616
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Did you take my money?

617
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,820
No, I didn't.

618
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,220
But I...

619
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,580
I somehow lost 50 yuan.

620
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
Did you

621
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,060
spend it and forget?

622
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,940
No way.

623
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,780
I know how much I make. I didn't spend it.

624
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,580
Did you lose it or put it somewhere?

625
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,420
It's possible.

626
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,500
How about

627
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,300
you ask Guangming?

628
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,300
He would never take your money.

629
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,260
It's ok. Maybe

630
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,980
I lost it somewhere.

631
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,660
It's ok.

632
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,020
Don't worry about it.

633
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,660
English homework?

634
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,820
Guangming, I want to ask you something.

635
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,740
It's...

636
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,140
I didn't steal it.

637
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,460
Ok, don't be angry.

638
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,980
Come on.

639
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
I know you didn't take it.

640
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,220
Fan!

641
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,020
Come out.

642
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,380
Coming.

643
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,420
What's up?

644
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,860
Isn't your money right here?

645
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,740
So...

646
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,140
Is it on the fridge all the time?

647
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,460
Look, I must be blind,

648
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,300
definitely.

649
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,540
How could I lose my money

650
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,620
- at home?
- Really.

651
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Unbelievable.

652
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,020
Guangming is sensitive.

653
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,860
Be patient.

654
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,100
The remarriage

655
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,500
or stepfather-stepson relationship

656
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,180
needs a little more work.

657
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
Disagreements are natural,

658
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,860
but mutual understanding bridges the gap.

659
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,780
It's ok.

660
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,540
Guangming,

661
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,420
I bought your favorite soda.

662
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,300
Drink.

663
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,660
I'd like

664
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,420
to apologize to you first.

665
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,380
About the money last time...

666
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,620
Why are you bringing it up?

667
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,780
I have to make it clear to Guangming.

668
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,140
Well,

669
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,220
don't be mad at me.

670
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,940
I'd like to propose a toast.

671
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,780
To our little gang.

672
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,500
We're not criminals.

673
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,260
Why are we a gang?

674
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,060
Collective.

675
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,620
See, Guangming is right. Collective.

676
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,620
To our little collective.

677
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,860
Come on.

678
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,220
Come on, eat. Hurry up.

679
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,060
Let's eat,

680
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,860
or the food will get cold.

681
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,020
Try this, son.

682
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,820
Our family

683
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,460
is special.

684
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,820
Like in the Beijing opera, The Red Lantern,

685
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,060
we have three different surnames.

686
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,420
You'd better stop.

687
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,260
Mom,

688
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,700
Uncle Fan is right.

689
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
The three of us have three surnames.

690
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,260
Look, Guangming agrees with me.

691
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,580
That's

692
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,060
the hard part.

693
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,420
So,

694
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,820
Guangming, I'll drink to you again.

695
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,860
From now on, let's speak our minds,

696
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,420
ok? Let's call it

697
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,100
"happy cooperation".

698
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,500
Mom.

699
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,660
Yeah, right.

700
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,140
Let's eat.

701
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,780
Here.

702
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,140
Ok.

703
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,140
Ok.

704
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,780
You hold it.

705
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,980
I'll turn on the light.

706
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,020
- Ok, good.
- Ok?

707
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,420
Ok. Be careful.

708
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
Ok.

709
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,260
Jianguo.

710
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,820
- You stay back.
- It's heavy.

711
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,140
Did you carry it all by myself?

712
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,620
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

713
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,500
Have some water.

714
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
- Water.
- Thanks, Jiali.

715
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,780
It's spacious and bright.

716
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,140
A small dining room.

717
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,820
We decorated it ourselves.

718
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,380
Amazing.

719
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,420
He got a nice apartment

720
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,180
but lost the rank of regiment.

721
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,420
Don't mention it.

722
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,660
Don't we work hard for the kids' sake?

723
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,500
Exactly.

724
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,940
Alright.

725
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,900
Jiali, Jianguo,

726
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,060
I'll head out if there's nothing else.

727
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,820
Come visit us when the decoration is done.

728
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,380
Fang Tao,

729
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,780
have you been in touch with Jiahuan lately?

730
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,220
We were

731
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,620
never on the same level.

732
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,660
Perhaps parting ways is best for us.

733
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,460
She's got a temper.

734
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,700
Leave her alone

735
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,020
and she'll be fine in a few days.

736
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,700
You're the only one who can stand her.

737
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,100
You're more than enough for her.

738
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,100
You're flattering me, Jiali.

739
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,020
I need

740
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,780
to learn more.

741
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,620
Alright, let me know if you need help.

742
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,900
My vehicle is sitting there idle anyway.

743
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,620
Well...

744
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,500
You don't have to pay me for a small favor.

745
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,340
I'm leaving!

746
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,780
Thanks, Fang.

747
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,700
Call me if you need anything.

751
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,140
Take this.

What's going on?

753
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,460
It's probably about money,

754
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,100
nothing new.

755
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Look at his wife's ostentatious display.

756
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,620
It's either embezzlement

757
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,500
or bribery.

758
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,020
Just wait. There will be a bunch of arrests.

759
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,700
What are you doing here?

760
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,900
Slow down, Mom.

761
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,420
Good, good.

762
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,660
I can walk now.

763
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,820
I'm fine now.

764
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,820
You must be careful from now on.

765
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,220
Falls can be dangerous for seniors.

766
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,780
Luckily, Jiaxi has taken good care of you.

767
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,460
When mom gets better,

768
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,220
you don't have to stay here anymore.

769
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,500
Go home early.

770
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,660
Xiaoman and Hongyu need you too.

771
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,580
It's ok. Xiaoman comes over often.

772
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,300
Hongyu doesn't need me either.

773
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,300
He's out all day

774
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,820
and crashes the moment he gets back.

775
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,260
You can stay here short-term,

776
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,380
but is your mother-in-law ok with long-term?

777
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,220
You hide here because Mom fell.

778
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,820
Now that she's recovered,

779
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,900
there's no reason for you to stay.

780
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,660
Jiali, what do you mean by hiding?

781
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,100
I'm taking care of Mom openly and honestly.

782
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,020
Yaoyao, don't cry.

783
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,060
Are you sleepy, Yaoyao?

784
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,380
Mommy's putting you to bed.

785
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,980
Hello.

786
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,940
Jiali.

787
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Xiaoling, I have some news for you.

788
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,980
Go ahead.

789
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,580
Zhenmin...

790
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,020
What's he up to now?

791
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,180
I've paid him enough money.

792
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,420
He should be happy.

793
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,380
He is gone.

794
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,740
Heart attack.

795
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,460
He died in a few minutes.

796
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,580
Jiali,

797
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,220
could you cover the expenses for me

798
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,660
using the rent from my apartment?

799
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,780
I may not return for a while.

800
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,780
No problem.

801
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,740
How is Yangyang?

802
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,180
I saw him today.

803
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,420
Keep me posted of any developments.

804
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Of course.

805
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

806
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,380
It's ok.

807
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,060
- Please come again.
- Thanks.

808
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,900
Jiali.

809
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,180
Are you here to talk about Yangyang?

810
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,980
Don't worry about it.

811
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,260
Our family can afford to support him.

812
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,260
You misunderstood.

813
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,260
I was just passing by.

814
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Let's handle the matter as fairly as needed,

815
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,820
but

816
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,980
Yangyang's peace of mind comes first.

817
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,540
The problem is, Xiaoling is far away.

818
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,020
And

819
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,620
she just had a baby.

820
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,820
Did she?

821
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,260
She remarried and had a daughter.

822
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,900
So,

823
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,460
Xiaoling's situation

824
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,300
is different from Jiawen's.

825
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,420
Alright.

826
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,260
I didn't mean to push Yangyang out.

827
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,580
Don't feel pressured.

828
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,220
We're willing to raise Yangyang too.

829
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,540
Ok, let's talk about it later.

830
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,260
I'll get you some bread.

831
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,780
No need.

832
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,580
Get back to your work.

833
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,620
I've got things to do.

834
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,460
Weimin.

835
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,180
Why was Jiali here?

836
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,740
Xiaoling remarried

837
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,620
and had a daughter.

838
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,260
I think if that's the case,

839
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,220
we can't give Yangyang to them.

840
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Youmin doesn't have any children.

841
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,620
He and his wife can adopt Yangyang.

842
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,540
We can

843
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,060
subsidize them with money.

844
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,980
Money isn't a problem.

845
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,980
But will they agree with it?

846
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,380
Yangyang isn't a child anymore.

847
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,660
He's learned everything he needs to know.

848
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,020
And he

849
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,660
hasn't been close to them.

850
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,340
The problem is,

851
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,140
Xiaoling is still there.

852
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,380
Although she's away from home,

853
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,140
she's his mom after all.

854
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,380
Blood is thicker than water.

855
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,780
I'm also worried

856
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,460
that Youmin is small-minded.

857
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,140
He might think

858
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,740
that we ask him to raise someone else's son.

859
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
Then we'll take care of him.

860
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,540
Just another plate at the table.

861
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,180
I'm ok with it.

862
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,140
Alright, your call.

863
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,940
(Nova Bakery)

864
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,780
Come.

865
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,980
(Early 2000)

866
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,020
Mom, I really don't want to go back.

867
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
Still, you have to.

868
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,060
A married daughter can't be taken back.

869
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,140
How can you live with your mom?

870
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,780
But Jiali lives with you.

871
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,780
She has no mother-in-law.

872
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,180
No one will blame her.

873
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,420
Mom, I'm worried about you.

874
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,580
Who's going to take care of you?

875
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
I worry about every bite you take.

876
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,180
You're making a fuss.

877
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,580
No wonder it's cold inside.

878
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,860
Why did you open the door so wide?

879
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,020
Just airing the room. I'll close it later.

880
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,580
Why did you take my Asparagus Fern out?

881
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,740
It wasn't me. It was Jiaxi.

882
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,620
You didn't even water it.

883
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,980
You've been keeping it for years.

884
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,020
Don't you know the "soak and dry" rule?

885
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,860
It's drying out.

886
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,780
Isn't it just fine?

887
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,020
(Stride across the new century)

888
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,620
One more. Two more.

889
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,700
And this.

890
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,180
(Usher in the millennium)

891
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,140
Here, two yuan.

892
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,220
- I'll tie it for you.
- No need, I'll do it.

893
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,940
Now it's good.

894
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,620
I'll grab some melon seeds. Bye.

895
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,460
Ok.

896
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,420
Come back again.

897
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,260
Miss!

898
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Excuse me,

899
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,060
is there any cheap and good hotel

900
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,540
in your neighborhood?

901
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,060
There's Nova Hotel up ahead,

902
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,220
and then Longyuan Hotel on the right.

903
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,820
Not a fancy hotel.

904
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,540
I don't have much money.

905
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,060
Just a cheap one with hot water.

906
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,300
There's nothing like that around here.

907
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,260
Why is it so hard to find a small hotel

908
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,300
in such a big place?

909
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,660
Thanks.

910
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,660
Honey.

911
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,020
Why don't we open a hotel?

912
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,700
Hotel?

913
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
What kind of hotel?

914
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,380
One of those

915
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,860
affordable.

916
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,500
I don't think

917
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,300
there are many of those hotels.

918
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,380
Then,

919
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,660
we'll have to rent a place.

920
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,060
Also, the location is very important.

921
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,900
Yes,

922
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,220
the location matters.

923
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,340
Opening a hotel requires

924
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,780
more investment than a bathhouse, right?
