Well down, Jiaxi.
You sing better and better.

This isn't the best I can do.

17
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,740
Xiaoling, Jiaxi.

18
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,850
- Look who's here.
- Boss.

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,540
- Isn't this...?
- Mr. Li.

20
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,700
Yes.

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
He's a frequent visitor.

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,780
Congratulations.

23
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,740
Today's show is a great success.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,660
Congratulations.

25
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,820
Thank you for coming.

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,180
Here.

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,300
You're the new singer, huh?

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,260
Yes, she's my sister.

29
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,260
They're sisters.

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,300
Real sisters?

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,140
Exactly.

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,340
The two of you

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,780
sing really beautifully.

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,100
You bet.

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,940
Do I have the honor

36
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,740
to buy you a midnight snack?

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,170
Ok. No problem.

38
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,940
- Let's go.
- Ok.

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,740
- It's ok.
- Good.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,140
Let's go.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
My sister is shy.

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,420
- It's your turn.
- Stop crying.

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,380
Stop crying. Wait.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,260
Grandma will play.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,140
East.

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,370
Think of my daughter-in-law.

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,220
She doesn't take care of her baby,

48
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,500
but I have to.

49
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,900
Instead,

50
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,940
she lives an easy life.

51
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,980
Come on. Stop crying.

52
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,140
Don't cry anymore.

53
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,260
- Jiaxi...
- Stop crying.

54
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,140
What's she doing?

55
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,260
Who knows?

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,700
Since she got laid off,

57
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,340
she's been mysterious.

58
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,300
She often goes out at night.

59
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,580
I don't know why,

60
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,180
but she went out three times a week.

61
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,540
She's making money.

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,260
Making money in the night?

63
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,460
You don't know?

64
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,060
Never mind, then.

65
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
What do you mean?

66
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,140
Don't keep me guessing.

67
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,860
I hear she's singing for a living

68
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,180
in Crown Nightclub.

69
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,380

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,460

What a shrew. Security.

84
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,180

88
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,180
Please talk nicely.

89
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,740
- Leave me alone. He Jiaxi.
- Mom.

90
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Oh, Jiaxi. Umm...

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,180
Stop it. Go back home quickly.

92
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,420
Jiaxi, shall I call the police?

93
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,300
Call the police?

94
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,380
You know what? You offer

95
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,860
such messy services.

96
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,020
The police will
screw you sooner or later.

97
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,500
- Mom.
- Don't touch me, you know?

98
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
- But...
- Back off!

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,700
- We'll talk.
- Never!

100
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,980
It's our own business.

101
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,900
You're wearing such a short dress.

102
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,700
It's even backless.

103
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,540
Jiaxi.

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,590
- Such a shame.
- Be safe.

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,180
You totally disgrace our family.

106
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,020
You know?

107
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,260
That's not a place for decent people.

108
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
Jiali, no offense,

109
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,460
but I have to criticize you.

110
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,140
You keep saying

111
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,180
you've disciplined your sisters

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
and they're well tutored.

113
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,140
How did you discipline

114
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,060
or tutor them?

115
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,200
Wang, I'm sorry.

116
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,660
We didn't know about this.

117
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,740
Today, we're here

118
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,060
to offer an apology.

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,420
Can an apology solve anything?

120
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,500
Huh, Mrs. He?

121
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,340
Because of this,

122
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,900
my family is utterly discredited

123
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,780
and disgraced.

124
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,900
My daughter-in-law

125
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,700
sings for a living

126
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,420
in a nightclub. Come on.

127
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,620
How ashamed!

128
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Luckily, my son is out of town.

129
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,860
Or it would be big trouble.

130
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,700
He would...

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
He...

132
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,820
We understand.

133
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,180
We'll criticize Jiaxi.

134
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,380
We'll ask her to stop immediately

135
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,420
and make up for it.

136
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,220
It's not too late.

137
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,020
I tried so hard to convince Jiaxi.

138
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,860
"You can ignore anyone.

139
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,900
Hongyu,

140
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,580
your maternal family, and even me.

141
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,260
But you have to care for Xiaoman.

142
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,220
She's your daughter.

143
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,820
She needs dignity when she grows up."

144
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,660
Am I right?

145
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,460
Mrs. He, I don't mean to complain.

146
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,660
Well,

147
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,100
parents like us

148
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,820
always care for our children, huh?

149
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,500
You could have

150
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,060
quit your job.

151
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,620
You could have lived an easy life.

152
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,780
Why must you keep working so hard?

153
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,620
Is it the same thing?

154
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,980
They are two very different things,

155
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,820
Mrs. He.

156
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,780
When I keep working,

157
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,620
can your daughter

158
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,620
do such an indecent thing?

159
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,020
Is it ok?

160
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,100
- But...
- She is wrong.

161
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,380
We'll punish her.

162
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,900
But it's not as serious as you say.

163
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,580
That's not necessarily indecent.

164
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,020
He Jiali,

165
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,820
do you not know

166
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,660
what is indecent?

167
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
What do your sisters do?

168
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,420
I'm even too ashamed to say it.

169
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,860
This is so humiliating.

170
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,300
They're doing

171
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,020
what women do in the old society.

172
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,820
You know what?

173
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,140
Your fifth daughter is the worst.

174
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
What kind of sister is she?

175
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,580
She set a bad example for Jiaxi.

176
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,580
It's like a contagious disease.

177
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,420
She's a bad influence. They're both bad.

178
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,860
Stop making trouble.
Why do you work there?

179
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,220
What's worse,

180
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,380
you even get Jiaxi involved.

181
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,020
Maybe her husband will divorce her.

182
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
That's good.

183
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,220
Men are useless.

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,780
You're being impenitent.

185
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,420
Will you keep doing that?

186
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,260
Tianjia'an is a small place.

187
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,060
You may not have dignity, but we have.

188
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,450
What did I do, Jiali?

189
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,460
It's a part-time job.

190
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,580
Is it illegal?

191
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,460
I make money to support myself.

192
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,860
What is wrong with that?

193
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
Besides, every single penny I make

194
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,420
is clean.

195
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
I have a clear conscience.

196
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,620
Fine. You have a clear conscience.

197
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,780
But don't get Jiaxi involved.

198
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,180
We won't stop you
from doing anything indecent.

199
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,020
It's her business.

200
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,860
Go talk to her.

201
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,180
It's no use talking to me.

202
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,500
I didn't force her to sing.

203
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,220
If you continue,
don't say you're one of us.

204
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm not one of you all the time.

205
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm Liu Xiaoling and you're He Jiali.

206
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
You never take me as a real family.

207
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,940
Give me a way out, Jiali.

208
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,620
You should give us
a way out, Liu Xiaoling.

209
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,380
For most of your life,

210
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,620
have you done anything right?

211
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,820
I'll end up right.

212
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm back.

213
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,780
Mom, you're back.

214
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,100
What are you doing?

215
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm painting.

216
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,660
What have you painted?

217
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,380
You and me.

218
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,500
Which one is Mom

219
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,380
and which one is you?

220
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,820
This is Mom.

221
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,820
This is me.

222
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Look what Mom has bought you.

223
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,220
Look, your favorite fried food.

224
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,340
Great.

225
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,500
Give your eyes a break.

226
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,620
Go get two plates.

227
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,540
Mom asked them to brush it

228
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,220
with your favorite sweet sauces.

229
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,900
Eat it.

230
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,260
How does it taste?

231
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,300
Delicious.

232
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,980
Then eat more.

233
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,780
Slow down.

234
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,220
There's a little on your face.

235
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,860
Keep eating.

236
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,930
Mom,

237
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,260
will you leave me?

238
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,820
No, of course.

239
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,220
Why do you ask?

240
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Don't worry.

241
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,420
I'm your mother.

242
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,420
You're my son.

243
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,180
I'll never leave you alone.

244
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,860
Mom,

245
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,980
can you stop singing for a living?

246
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,380
Recently,

247
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,220
I talked to Weimin.

248
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,140
If you're really busy,

249
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,140
you can leave Yangyang to us.

250
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,300
We'll look after him.

251
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,100
Now, my work in the hospital

252
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,220
isn't that busy.

253
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,580
I have free time.

254
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,660
Do you have a problem with my job?

255
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,340
I just care for Yangyang.

256
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,460
Don't worry.

257
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,060
Qiufang, I quit the job.

258
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I'll look after Yangyang.

259
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,340
Glad to hear that.

260
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,940
(Cancer Hospital)

261
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,740
- Jiawen.
- Hongyu.

262
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,540
You had hard work.

263
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,740
Not at all.

264
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,660
Thanks for staying with us.

265
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,940
You can go back home.

266
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,890
Look. Weiguo

267
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,140
has settled down.

268
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,060
I can take care of him alone.

269
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,260
No, Jiawen.

270
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,860
I won't leave unless you go.

271
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,340
It's ok.

272
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,340
The doctors will just check on him

273
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,820
and discuss some other therapies.

274
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,100
Nothing else.

275
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,060
Can you stay alone, Jiawen?

276
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,020
Yes. Don't worry.

277
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,980
Come on.

278
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,620
Eat it before it gets cold.

279
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,740
Thanks, Jiawen.

280
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,900
On your way back,

281
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,420
drive slowly. Be patient.

282
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,740
When you're tired or sleepy,
stop somewhere

283
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,980
and have a rest.

284
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,340
Here. Hands are dirty.

285
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,220
Use the chopsticks.

286
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,060
I'm indeed hungry.

287
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,620
Jiawen, you eat some.

288
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,940
You haven't eaten yet.

289
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,780
Ok.

290
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,740
Here you are. See you.

291
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,620
Thank you.

292
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,340
May I help you?

293
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,940
Sir,

294
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,260
I want to order a cake.

295
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,100
No problem.

296
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,540
Which one do you want?

297
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,580
When do you want it?

298
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,260
(Happy birthday)
I want this.

299
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,820
I want it this afternoon.

300
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
Ok.

301
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,700
Anything on it?

302
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,900
Yes.

303
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,660
"Weiguo,

304
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,860
happy birthday."

305
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,340
W-E-I, Wei.

306
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,540
G-U-O, Guo.

307
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
Deal.

308
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,340
Do you want candles?

309
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,380
Yes.

310
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,860
Forty candles.

311
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,100

Do you want some eggs?

343
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,700
- Two, please.
- Two?

344
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Here you are.

345
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,700
How much?

346
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,780
0.5 yuan for each.

347
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
Two, please.

348
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,180
Here you are.

349
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,260
Ms. Gao.

350
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,700
You've sold really a lot.

351
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,060
Not too bad.

352
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,900
I only sold two bottles of soda.

353
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,460
People look but they don't buy.

354
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Be patient.

355
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,740
It's hard to sell things.

356
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,580
Right.

357
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
What happened?

358
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,500
It's all on your hair.

359
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,860
Wipe it.

360
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,860
What a coincidence.

361
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,460
Son.

362
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,260
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

363
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,300
Have some water.

364
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,100
You've lost weight
from recent hard work.

365
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,300
Think about it.

366
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,260
It's their family business.

367
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,700
Why must you have a hard time?

368
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,100
Mom, don't say that.

369
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,300
Everybody gets in trouble.

370
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,860
You just can't see.

371
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,100
Weiguo lost too much weight.

372
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,940
Eat it.

373
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
Is everything alright

374
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,100
in our family?

375
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,020
When the cat's away,

376
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,500
the mice will play.

377
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,340
Your wife...

378
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,300
Good. You're doing business.

379
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,700
You're back?

380
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,220
Mm.

381
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,300
See?

382
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,860
She always pulls a long face.

383
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,500
Guess why.

384
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,420
Say no more.

385
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,060
I'll go check on her.

386
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,620
Don't. You haven't finished eating.

387
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,860
- I'll go.
- It'll get cold.

388
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,740
I'll go up. Wait.

389
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,900
Hongyu, finish your food first.

390
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,260
Now, I'm back.

391
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,700
Don't you ask how Weiguo is doing?

392
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,420
There's nothing new about liver cancer.

393
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,500
He'll die.

394
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,940
Guess what I've bought you.

395
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
Wash later.

396
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,420
Get in here.

397
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,740
Are you insane, Yan Hongyu?

398
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,330
Hands off me.

399
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,500
Remove...

400
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,060
Remove your hands.

401
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,220
It's your favorite color.

402
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,940
Can it be returned?

403
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,980
What do you mean?

404
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,220
Why will I return it?

405
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,180
Do you think I can sell eggs

406
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,060
in this kind of coat?

407
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,420
Why can't you?

408
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,060
You'll look great in it.

409
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,740
You'll attract customers.

410
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,340
Will I sell eggs or will I sell myself?

411
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,740
How could you talk so unhandsomely?

412
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,060
Go around on the street and see

413
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,660
what people wear when selling eggs.

414
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,060
Don't bother what they wear.

415
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,460
There's no dress code for selling eggs.

416
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,460
This coat is just inappropriate.

417
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,300
Don't say that. Try it on.

418
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
When I was selling eggs,

419
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,340
bird poop fell on my face.

420
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,900
It's ok.

421
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,220
It's not a problem.

422
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,060
Today, I'm eating

423
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,260
the tea-flavored eggs all my life.

424
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
I can't eat like this,
however much I love eggs.

425
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,660
These are the last eggs.

426
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,660
Just finish them.

427
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
Why don't you give them
to your mother-in-law?

428
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,300
Then, I would rather stuff myself.

429
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,500
Oh, you hate her so much now.

430
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,940
Like I said,

431
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,140
living together is troublesome.

432
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,220
Will you really not sing?

433
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,100
No. You won't go, anyway.

434
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,860
Come on. We're in different cases.

435
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,420
I'm not in control of my life.

436
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,060
But you can have your own way.

437
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,460
No, I can't.

438
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,860
In such a small city,

439
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,420
people meet all the time.

440
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,340
I don't want to disgrace Mom or Jiali.

441
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,060
Jiali talked to you?

442
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,660
Anyway, I don't think

443
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,740
we can stay here.

444
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,220
Come on.

445
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,540
You have a secure job.

446
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,620
Much better than me.

447
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,740
Hey, Jiaxi.

448
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,260
We should go out and challenge, really.

449
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,300
Challenge?

450
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,220
- Go into business?
- Yes.

451
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
What can we do?

452
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,740
Anything.

453
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,300
Fortunes are everywhere in the south.

454
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,260
Maybe we'll be pop stars.

455
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,740
We aren't blessed like that.

456
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,660
So, a woman like you

457
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,740
appears to be ambitious.

458
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,260
But you're never tough when necessary.

459
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,500
Then,

460
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,900
I have to discuss it with Hongyu.

461
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,620
If we go, what about Xiaoman?

462
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,860
What about Yangyang?

463
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,940
My child will go with me.

464
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,860
Yours will go with you.

465
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,660
Hongyu won't approve.

466
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,180
So, Hongyu calls the shots

467
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,520
in big cases.

468
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,020
Whatever he says is the law.

469
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,660
How about I tell Hongyu

470
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,420
and ask for his opinion?

471
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,660
That's right. Talk to him.

472
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,260
He can drive a taxi anywhere.

473
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,100
We can do some great work in the south

474
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,980
and make a difference.

475
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,380
We'll go together.

476
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,460
Let me feel it.

477
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,820
You don't have a fever.

478
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,780
Your eyes focus, too.

479
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,860
Don't be ridiculous.

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,940
Leave everything alone

481
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,140
and do business with Xiaoling.

482
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,100
Is that realistic?

483
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,460
We both lost our jobs.

484
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,380
Going into business is an option.

485
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,540
What about Xiaoman?

486
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,860
And our parents?

487
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,580
We'll take Xiaoman with us.

488
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,700
Our parents

489
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,460
aren't old enough
to be looked after, right?

490
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,740
Let's challenge while we can.

491
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,580
I don't approve.

492
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,220
I'll go talk to Xiaoling.

493
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,580
She's being ridiculous.

494
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,820
She wants to quit her job

495
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,780
and take you away.

496
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
Do you think Jiali and Mom will approve?

497
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,860
I just have this idea
and I'm talking to you about it.

498
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,740
This... This idea

499
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,060
isn't actually normal.

500
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,940
Now, I'm putting out this little flame.

501
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,140
Or it would be a fire.

502
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,020
What do we do, then?

503
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,180
Tell me what to do!

504
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,820
Do I have to sell eggs as before?

505
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,860
I...

506
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
I want you to do that for the moment.

507
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,380
I've closed the stall anyway!

508
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,180
I can't sell eggs
for even one single day!

509
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,260
You won't, then!

510
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,420
Well...

511
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,240
It's normal that people rise and fall.

512
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,740
Think about us.

513
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,780
In some cases,

514
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,060
we live a better life.

515
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,460
Jiawen and her husband are suffering.

516
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,500
Let's just live our lives

517
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,180
stably and peacefully.

518
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,540
We'll enjoy as much as we can earn.

519
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,980
How unambitious.

520
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,940
How about we move out?

521
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,460
Here you go again.

522
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,900
First, go into business.

523
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,380
Second, move out. Make your choice.

524
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,780
It's not the season
for thermal underpants.

525
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,060
If we don't wear thermal clothes,

526
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,900
our knees will hurt.

527
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,180
Today, let's do some shopping.

528
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,180
I'll pay the bills.

529
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,180
The jeans are good.

530
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,020
- Here. Take one.
- No, I won't.

531
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,290
No, no.

532
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,020
I'm too old to need this.

533
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Ms. Liu.

534
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,860
Oh, Fang Tao.

535
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,260
Jiahuan, are you also shopping?

536
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,860
We're hanging around.

537
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,380
Let me introduce you.

538
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,460
This is Fang Tao, Jiahuan's husband.

539
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,660
This is my son.

540
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,100
He's just back from abroad.

541
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,100
We met.

542
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,660
When did you meet?

543
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,820
On the day he returned,
Jiahuan and I got him back.

544
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,660
She didn't introduce him, though.

545
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,820
That's right.

546
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,380
We're old friends.

547
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,380
Indeed.

548
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,020
Are your hands stuck together?

549
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,060
We meet again.

550
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,660
Yeah, that's right.

551
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,420
We just said hello.

552
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420
Do you have to be angry?

553
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,260
What is your real relationship?

554
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,820
Do you need to be so bashful?

555
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,780
I said, I have nothing to do with him.

556
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,340
Then why did you avoid him?

557
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,780
Have you known for a long time?

558
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,940
He's my neighbor.

559
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,540
We grew up together. What do you think?

560
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,940
If we could love each other,
we would have done that.

561
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,220
Jiahuan.

562
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
If he adores you,

563
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,180
I'll talk to him.

564
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,660
But I fear you may adore him.

565
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,500
Fang Tao!

566
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,940
Are you being so malicious

567
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,220
about your wife?

568
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,180
I fear you'll change!

569
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,020
I won't change!

570
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,620
You're a man.

571
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,940
Be more confident, will you?

572
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,380
I'm a taxi driver.

573
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,580
When I saw an overseas returnee

574
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,430
put a scarf on you,

575
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,860
how could I be confident?

576
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,860
You're hopeless.

577
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,540
I'm even planning to buy a red scarf!

578
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,300
(Cancer Hospital)

579
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,900
Listen.

580
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,940
Stay here

581
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,980
and do the therapy.

582
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,020
Or we'll go to another hospital.

583
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,020
Even the best hospital

584
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,740
can't be as comfortable as my home.

585
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,340
I should go home.

586
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,740
But you need the therapy.

587
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,900
The therapy can't save my life.

588
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,980
I know my health conditions.

589
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Let's go home.

590
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,380
As long as you stay

591
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,140
and take the therapy,

592
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,540
there will be hope.

593
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,140
I miss Guangming.

594
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,100
Mom, I brought back
the specialty from Shanghai.

595
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,940
Taste it.

596
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,140
How do doctors say
about Weiguo's problem?

597
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,820
Someone with the same cancer

598
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
was cured.

599
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,100
That's good news.

600
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
What's the therapy?

601
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,740
Chinese and Western therapies.

602
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
So,

603
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,380
there is hope, right?

604
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,980
Yes. There's always hope.

605
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,500
I knew it.

606
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,740
God is fair.

607
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,780
Mom.

608
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,300
This is for the festival.

609
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,220
Keep it.

610
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,340
You're having a hard time.

611
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,580
Why do you give me the money?

612
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,940
Take it back.

613
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,340
Your grandma

614
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,500
asked me to bring you her ginseng.

615
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,380
Mom, I won't take it.

616
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,540
Don't be silly. It's not for you.

617
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,100
She gave it to Weiguo for recuperation.

618
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,580
Don't reject it.

619
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
Put it away.

620
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,380
Thank you, Mom.

621
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,820
Come on.

622
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,940
Let's have dinner.

623
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
Mom. I want some juice.

624
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,020
Go make some, then.

625
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,580
I want some juice, too.

626
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,540
You can only drink water.

627
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,700
Water is fine.

628
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,700
Guangming.

629
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,900
Get some water for your dad.

630
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,740
Jiawen.

631
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,140
You must have had a hard time.

632
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,940
You've been staying with me.

633
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Thank you.

634
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Don't say that.

635
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,740
In the future,

636
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,620
I'll still stay.

637
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,020
Stop being so angry.

638
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,940
She's angry with herself.

639
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Yeah. If I were her,

640
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,740
I would be angry, too.

641
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,380
She ruined a very good life.

642
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,380
Her great family broke up, right?

643
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,940
What do you say, Liu Xiaoling?

644
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,540
Mom, Grandma,

645
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,220
I have something to tell you.

646
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,180
Go ahead. What is it?

647
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,140
To work up my courage?

648
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,300
I want to go out.

649
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,540
Where will you go?

650
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,340
I'll go into business in the south.

651
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,500
What will you do?

652
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,780
I can do anything.

653
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,420
I can sell things.

654
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,380
I can sing.

655
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,140
I can do a lot.

656
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,340
Isn't that profiteering?

657
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,980
- No. It's business.
- Sing for a living?

658
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,100
Come on.

659
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140
What is wrong with you?

660
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,340
Work hard

661
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,740
and keep yourself grounded.

662
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,140
Then, get remarried

663
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,500
and settle down.

664
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,300
Mom, there you go again.

665
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,340
When I'm just divorced,

666
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,380
you want me to be married.

667
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,820
Who will I marry?

668
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,940
There's no good man
within this territory.

669
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,140
What is a good man?

670
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,620
A good man must be

671
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,260
ambitious, aspiring,

672
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,100
money-hungry, and hard-working.

673
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,740
He will struggle with me.

674
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,740
Does this kind of man even exist

675
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,140
for my fifth daughter?

676
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,580
It's not getting dark yet.

677
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,940
Stop daydreaming.

678
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,540
Mom, Grandma, really.

679
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,820
Let me be serious.

680
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,180
My job is scheduled.

681
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,940
There's no space for development.

682
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,120
Look up.

683
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,780
That way!

684
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,300
You took over your dad's job.

685
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,540
How dare you want to quit?

686
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,340
Liu Xiaoling,

687
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,540
don't you feel guilty for him?

688
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,380
Keep it in mind.

689
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,020
Unless I'm dead,

690
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,340
you won't even think about it.

691
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,140
You don't have to say that.

692
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,580
Besides, Dad didn't pass away

693
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,580
because he gave me his job.

694
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,620
Accidents always happen

695
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,500
and Dad had an accident.

696
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,340
Xiaoling,

697
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,340
a lot of people have lost their jobs.

698
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,180
You still have one.

699
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,100
Don't be too greedy.

700
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,220
Mom, it's almost done, huh?

701
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,220
Ok.

702
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,260
Mom.

703
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,810
- You're back.
- Jiaxi?

704
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,660
Where's Xiaoman?

705
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,780
She's home.
Hongyu is taking care of her.

706
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,940
Looks like she's angry
with her mother-in-law again.

707
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,060
- Right?
- What about Yangyang?

708
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,020
He's at his father's home.

709
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,260
They usually ignore him.

710
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,580
Now, they want him for the festival.

711
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,740
Don't say that.

712
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,700
Zhenmin pays child support every month.

713
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,980
Qiufang and Weimin help a lot, too.

714
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,780
So, you should talk reasonably.

715
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,620
Mom.

716
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,100
Making dumplings?

717
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,820
You're back, Jiahuan.

718
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,860
You guys happen
to come back on the same day.

719
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,440
This noon,

720
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,130
we ate with Fang Tao's brothers.

721
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,500
Tonight, we'll eat here.

722
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,860
Are they still single?

723
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,790
Who dares to marry them?

724
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,660
What?

725
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,820
Don't look at me.

726
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,900
I won't marry

727
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,980
that kind of poor guy.

728
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,660
You don't do this.

729
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,180
The dumplings you make can't even stand.

730
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,860
I can do something else.

731
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,920
Jiahuan isn't afraid.

732
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,100
Her man takes care of her.

733
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,180
Have a rest, Jiahuan.

734
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,020
All right.

735
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,620
I don't think any one of us

736
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,180
has got a great husband.

737
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,420
That's not true.

738
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,420
Your four sisters are doing all right.

739
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,180
In marriage, we can only enjoy a part.

740
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,460
Nothing can be perfect.

741
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
How's Weiguo doing?

742
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,260
According to Hongyu, he can barely live.

743
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,140
If Jiawen loses his husband like me,

744
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,660
I can't even imagine.

745
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,620
Mom, don't be so pessimistic.

746
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,860
A woman lives even without a man.

747
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,660
I'm doing great, for example.

748
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,980
She isn't like you.

749
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,060
Your marriage life failed

750
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,900
and you divorced.

751
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,860
But Jiawen and Weiguo are sweet.

752
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,020
If Weiguo really dies,

753
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,020
Jiawen will be inconsolable.

754
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,500
How lively. Making dumplings?

755
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,740
- Hi, Ms. Liu.
- Ms. Liu.

756
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,620
Be seated.

757
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,820
No, no.

758
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,900
I'm here to borrow mahjong.

759
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,180
Mahjong? Go get it.

760
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,980
It's on my nightstand.

761
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,740
- Ok.
- Look for it.

762
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,060
Say hello.

763
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,900
Hello, Mrs. He.

764
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,780
Look, an overseas returnee

765
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,260
looks really different from us.

766
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,420
I'm forever Chinese.

767
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,580
Dumplings here taste best.

768
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,780
That's right.

769
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,180
Where's Lisha?

770
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,900
She isn't back.

771
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,980
We broke up.

772
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,020
Broke up? That's good.

773
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,700
Quite decisive, huh?

774
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,420
- What are you making?
- Broke up?

775
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,820
- Divorced?
- It looks good.

776
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,620
Yes. I'm divorced.

777
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,780
Well,

778
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,220
that's not a problem.

779
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,260
A lot of people are divorced.

780
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,900
Xiaoling is divorced, too.

781
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,980
Everybody can make a new life.

782
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,180
You're right, Mrs. He.

783
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,340
Here, Qiulin.

784
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,340
Thank you.

785
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,500
Mom,

786
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,180
the water's boiling.

787
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,420
I'll go.

788
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,620
Xiaoling is single now.

789
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,500
The water is boiling, Mom.

790
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,420
We're going back.

791
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,500
My guests need mahjong.

792
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,500
Let's go.

793
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,580
We're going back, then.

794
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,180
See you, Ms. Liu.

795
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,300
Come on.

796
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,460
Manager?

797
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,140
You're early today.

798
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,660
Liu Xiaoling,

799
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
what are you doing?

800
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,780
Handling the garbage.

801
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,860
Garbage?

802
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,090
Go to the Security Section.

803
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
Why would I go there?

804
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,100
Why?

805
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,060
You have to confess

806
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,460
what you're doing today!

807
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,940
- Let me explain.
- Go.

808
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,800
Just go.

809
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,740
I'll send my son to kindergarten.

810
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,900
Now, you think of your son?

811
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,460
- Let me explain.
- No!

812
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,540
Look.

813
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,900
Even if I didn't sell it,

814
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,540
the garbage would still be handled.

815
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,380
What are you doing?

816
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,660
Director Zhang.

817
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,100
She stole sheepskin.

818
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,460
Nonsense.

819
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,380
You stole sheepskin?

820
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,700
No, no.

821
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
I didn't, Director.

822
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,740
This is the garbage to be handled.

823
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,700
I just delivered it

824
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
and sold it.

825
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,260
We're supposed to handle the garbage.

826
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,820
Who are you to do that?

827
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,700
Yes, yes. You're right.

828
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,940
I'll put it back, then.

829
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,940
No way.

830
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,660
Tell me what to do.

831
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,940
We'll discuss it.

832
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,340
Hey, don't bother.

833
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,180
I'll quit.

834
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
I always wanted to quit.

835
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,700
What?

836
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,300
What's done is done.

837
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,300
Let's see what she'll do.

838
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,380
Mom,

839
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,740
Changsheng was right.

840
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,180
When Xiaoling was born,

841
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,860
the plier flattened her head.

842
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
She's out of her mind.

843
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,020
How could she

844
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,460
do such a silly thing?

845
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,620
That is a great job.

846
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,140
Jiaxi was too young to get it.

847
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,900
But Xiaoling discarded this secure job.

848
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,020
She even wants to do
what Ouyang Bao does.

849
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
Is she as wise as him?

850
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,100
Is she capable or well-educated?

851
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,460
Or can she bear hardships?

852
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,860
She's just unnecessarily ambitious.

853
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,820
That's right.

854
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,140
She has a foolish fantasy.

855
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,260
I believe

856
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,100
her head must have been flattened.

857
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,620
What the heck.

858
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,140
She'll have a hard time.

859
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,940
Or she won't stop.

860
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,420
Mom, this is even worse.

861
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,260
Actually, she has...

862
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,780
She has screwed herself.

863
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,620
Right.

864
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,900
(Huainan Zhigao Pharmaceutical)

865
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,500
Here is the list of post assignments.

866
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,660
I'll read it.

867
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,700
- Zhang Cuihua.
- Here.

868
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,860
Excipient Workshop.

869
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,300
- Wang Xiu.
- Here.

870
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,420
Capsule Workshop.

871
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,300
- Sun Xiaoxia.
- Here.

872
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,340
Excipient Workshop.

873
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,220
- He Jiawen.
- Here.

874
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,180
Gardening Department.

875
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,500
Director,

876
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,900
I remember I applied
for the Capsule Workshop.

877
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,500
It's the decision of the committee.

878
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,620
Go talk to them if you have a problem.

879
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,820
Fine.

880
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,740
- Zhang Meiling.
- Here.

881
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,380
Director.

882
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,020
What's up, Jiawen?

883
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,260
I'm not ok with my assignment.

884
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,820
That job suits you.

885
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,660
But my husband is sick.

886
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,060
I have a son, too.

887
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,700
That department

888
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
doesn't offer a bonus.

889
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,100
But now,

890
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,140
you can't work
in the Capsule or Excipient Workshop.

891
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Think about it.

892
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,300
Since you started to work,

893
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,140
how many days have you had off?

894
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,660
We're a collective.

895
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,100
We need economic benefits.

896
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,460
In your case,

897
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,460
you can even be fired.

898
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,540
Leaders keep you for the sake
of your family situation.

899
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Jiawen, the Gardening Department

900
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,100
offers a low pay.

901
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,620
But you'll have plenty of free time.

902
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,180
You can take care of your family, right?

903
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,140
If you don't accept it,

904
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,620
you can quit.

905
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,900
Jiaxi.

906
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,060
Jiaxi.

907
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,940
Come out and help.

908
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,500
Where are you?

909
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,100
I'm here.

910
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,860
- Come on.
- Move it in.

911
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,460
Watch your hands.

912
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,380
It's ok, I think.

913
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,700
Are you sure?

914
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,940
Are you satisfied now?

915
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,660
We moved here and spent the money.

916
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,020
What are you talking about?

917
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,500
Aren't you satisfied or comfortable?

918
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,900
Can you bear that old home?
