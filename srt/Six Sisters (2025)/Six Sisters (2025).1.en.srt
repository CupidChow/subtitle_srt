Your dad said he'd pick us up.

19
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,500
(He Jiali, He's eldest daughter)
Why hasn't he come yet?

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
Forget it. We're not waiting.

21
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750

Grandma,

25
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm hungry again.

26
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,080
Didn't you eat earlier?

27
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,080
I threw up on the ship.

28
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,360
Why did Mom and Dad come here?

29
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,000
What's wrong with our hometown?

30
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,630
They're supporting national development.

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,190
What does that mean?

32
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,400
So we can have food every day.

33
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,590
That's good.

36
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,000

37
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,710
Jiali, knock on the door.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,190
Be polite.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
Anyone here?

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,950
This is your home.

41
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,240
Your mom and dad are in there.

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,390
Call them.

43
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,920
Dad, I'm Jiali.

44
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,190
I'm with Grandma.

45
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,790
Dad.

46
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,480
Open the door.

47
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Changsheng!

48
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,830
(Zhang Qiufang)
Are you Mrs. He?

49
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,720
Changsheng and Meixin
went to the hospital.

50
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,680
Meixin is having a baby.

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,560
My mom told me to wait for you.

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,480
Changsheng asked me to give you this.

53
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,750
Look, Dad left it to you.

54
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,720
Hurry, take it.

55
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,950
What's your name, little girl?

56
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,000
Zhang Qiufang.

57
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,270
Qiufang, would you
take us to the hospital?

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,620

Changsheng.

61
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,110
Changsheng.

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
Mom.

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,320
Grandma's here.

64
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,510
Mom, you're here.

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
Is Meixin in there?

66
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,390
She's about to give birth.

67
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,750
Put your bags down.

68
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,590
Come here.

69
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,120
Jiali, you missed your dad.

70
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,100
Why don't you call him?

71
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,180
(He Jiawen, He's second daughter)

72
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,640
(He Changsheng)
You've shot up so much.

73
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,910
Dad.

74
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,360
Jiawen, call Grandma.

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
Let me carry you.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Grandma will carry you.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Jiawen.

78
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,270
Why don't you call Grandma?

79
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,960
Mom, I got my fortune told.

80
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,360
It's definitely a son.

81
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,770
Really?

82
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,320
Great.

83
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,460
Mom, you don't have to wait here.

84
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
The keys.

85
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,020
- You take Jiali...
- No, I'll stay.

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,860
Let's wait together.

87
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,460
(Model Worker, Reward)

88
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,140
Mr. Tang.

89
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,660
(Big Tang)
I know what you're worried about.

90
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,300
About Changsheng and Meixin, right?

91
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,620
(Zhu Deqi)
My gut feeling is never wrong.

92
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,620
He's had two girls already.

93
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,460
He'll have a boy this time.

94
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,380
Do you think He Changsheng

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,500
is that lucky?

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,500
From Jiangdu to Huainan,

97
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,820
I've been watching him.

98
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,100
This guy doesn't have what it takes.

99
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,460
(Operating)
Who's Liu Meixin's family?

100
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,500
I am.

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
Girl.

102
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,030
Changsheng,

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,700
it's ok. Boys and girls are the same.

104
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,620
This is the third girl.

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,180
What's wrong with my dad?

106
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,570
Nothing.

107
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,220
Meixin, have some.

108
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,500
Skip your recovery,
pay with your health.

109
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Changsheng managed to get brown sugar.

110
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,100
It's hard to get these days.

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,500
He cares about you. Drink it.

112
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,340
(Liu Meixin)

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,660
If he cares about me,

114
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,220
why hasn't he come back yet?

115
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,820
He said something happened at work.

116
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,460
I know he's not happy with me.

117
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,620
I know he wants a boy,

118
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,900
so do I.

119
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,420
But fate had other plans.

120
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,180
Logically speaking,

121
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,780
boys and girls hold equal value.

122
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,700
Even Chairman Mao said,

123
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,580
"Women hold up half the sky."

124
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,460
It's my fault.

125
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,020
If I had

126
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,500
three or five sons like other women,

127
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,980
we wouldn't be afraid of anyone.

128
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,340
Changsheng is lonely deep down.

129
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,300
We have four daughters.

130
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,180
He is our only son.

131
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Alright, let's say no more. Drink up.

132
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,980
Congratulations.

133
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,180
For what?

134
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,900
For having my third daughter?

135
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,900
(Zhu Laoda)

136
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,940
Why are you still thinking this way?

137
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,090
But look,

138
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,900
I left my hometown for this place.

139
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,060
Without a son,

140
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
how can I build a foundation?

141
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,780
Personally, I think

142
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,260
when you

143
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,300
reach a certain age,

144
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,460
you have to accept your fate.

145
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,900
You know, my wife died early.

146
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,660
So once and for all,

147
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,820
I gave up on that idea.

148
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
That is

149
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,460
my fate.

150
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,340
Come on.

151
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,380
Finally, you are back.

152
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Look how sweet our daughter is.

153
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,220
She's quiet.

154
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,180
She's too hungry to cry.

155
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,140
Her mom is too hungry

156
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,740
to give her enough milk.

157
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,300
Look.

158
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,940
Here.

159
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,220
I'll get some fried dough twist tomorrow

160
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,020
and soak it for you to eat.

161
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Have you contacted the school?

162
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,060
Jiali has to go to school.

163
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,940
Yes, it's all done.

164
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,260
Just focus on your postnatal recovery.

165
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,940
Don't worry about anything.

166
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,820
He Changsheng, listen carefully.

167
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,220
Don't think you can
pull a long face to me

168
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,860
for giving birth to a girl.

169
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,020
We're a production cooperative.

170
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,420
I'm not running it alone.

171
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Are you clear?

172
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,580
Cooperative?

173
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,420
Sure, got it.

174
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,060
Changsheng,

175
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,500
need a hand?

176
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,620
No, thanks.

177
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,460
He, you're not fast enough.

178
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Sheepskin and rabbitskin checked off.

179
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,180
When will you check the pig bristles?

180
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,380
Can they be stocked before lunch?

181
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,820
I'll hurry. It won't be a problem.

182
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,300
Hurry up

183
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,860
and do it well.

184
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,260
It's like

185
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,940
having babies, right?

186
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,780
You don't just have many of them.

187
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,260
You need a boy
to take over the business.

188
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,580
By the way, I heard

189
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,660
you had another girl.

190
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah, girl.

191
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,060
Congratulations.

192
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,700
Another girl.

193
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,540
How many are there?

194
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,660
The third or the fourth?

195
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,620
How many now?

196
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,180
Three.

197
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,340
Sit down.

198
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,420
Sir, sit down and take a break.

199
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,700
- Incredible.
- Freshly made.

200
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,060
Three.

201
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,180
Why did you make it so hot?

202
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,940
- It's my fault.
- Did you get burned?

203
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,780
I forgot to tell you.

204
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,980
(Class 1 Grade 3)

205
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,020
Let's welcome our new classmate.

206
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,220
(Unity, discipline,
vitality, and solemnity)

207
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,660
He Jiali,

208
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
would you introduce yourself?

209
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,980
May I do some martial arts?

210
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,300
Sure.

211
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,780
(Tang Weimin, Tang's first son)

212
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,500
Take the fourth row in the center.

213
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Thank you, ma'am.

214
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,660
Take out your textbooks.

215
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,100
Turn to page five.

216
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,260
Move.

217
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,060
Your martial arts looked amazing.

218
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,020
None of your business.

219
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,300
Which gang are you with?

220
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,580
I'll count to three.

221
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,140
If you don't move, I'll hurt you.

222
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,060
I'll count for you.

223
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,340
One.

224
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,820
Help me! Come on!

225
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,460
I'm not done with you!

226
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,220
Stupid coward.

227
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,380
Mom, I'm home.

228
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,100
Is it Jiali? Get me a diaper.

229
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,060
Yes.

230
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,740
Jiali,

231
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,100
did you get it?

232
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,900
Jiawen.

233
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,740
This...

234
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,700
This is gone.

235
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,940
This is gone.

236
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,420
Mom, I'm home.

237
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,890
You're home.

238
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,930
Dad's home.

239
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,270
What's wrong?

240
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,620
You look distressed.

241
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,820
Anything happened at work?

242
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,300
We're from the same town as Big Tang.

243
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,100
Mom,

244
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,140
you know,

245
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,900
those old trivial matters,

246
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,820
why can't he...

247
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
Unbelievable.

248
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,500
We've held grudges against each other

249
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,100
for a long time.

250
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,580
He mocked me again

251
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,660
for not having a son.

252
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,020
Jiali, your dad is home.

253
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,620
Set the table for dinner.

254
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,260
This soup

255
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,140
is cleaner than a monk's diet.

256
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,340
It's been difficult these years.

257
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,220
Hang in there.

258
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,140
It will get better sooner or later.

259
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,540
I'll think of something

260
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
and ask Zhu Laoda

261
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,380
to get us more fried dough twist

262
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,740
and a couple of pork coupons.

263
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,340
By the way, today,

264
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
I made some lard dregs.

265
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,220
Jiali, go get it.

266
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,260
Go.

267
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,380
Won't you help Grandma?

268
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,580
I'll go.

269
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,780
Nothing.

270
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,140
No lard dregs.

271
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Maybe

272
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,900
the rats ate it.

273
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,700
I'm so forgetful.

274
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,300
I forgot to make it today.

275
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,140
I'll do it tomorrow.

276
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,140
Mom, how can you make it?

277
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,780
We only got a little bit of pork skin.

278
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,260
Won't you admit it?

279
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,740
When you steal food again,

280
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,900
wipe your mouth clean.

281
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,340
I can smell it from across the table.

282
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,420
I didn't steal it!

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,940
I just saw it and couldn't help myself.

284
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420
So you put it in your own mouth?

285
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,580
That's stealing.

286
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,440
It's not stealing.

287
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,700
Then what is it?

288
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,180
That's for your mom.

289
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,620
Apologize to Mom.

290
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,740
What did I do wrong?

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,540
Everyone is equal in the new society.

292
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,340
Why does mom get to eat everything?

293
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,500
Why can't we?

294
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,020
Only the landlord class plays favorites.

295
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,940
What are you talking about?

296
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,740
Do you want a beating?

297
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,220
Enough!

298
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,380
It's no big deal.

299
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,940
Changsheng, don't vent your anger

300
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,340
on your family.

301
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,220
Say no more.

302
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,380
Less firewood.

303
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,740
Your mom

304
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,140
isn't demanding preferential treatment.

305
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,420
She gets to eat the fried dough twist,

306
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,140
fermented bean curd,

307
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,940
lard dregs,

308
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,620
and the only egg.

309
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,700
We can only eat pickles, flour paste,

310
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,500
steamed corn bun, and soy sauce soup.

311
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,570
Why?

312
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,180
Because she gave you a sister

313
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,020
and contributed to our family.

314
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,940
Do you know how hard it is
to have a baby?

315
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,220
We should be united

316
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,460
as a family.

317
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,500
But dad doesn't unit with us.

318
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,140
He wasn't happy with my sister's birth.

319
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,740
He has his own trouble.

320
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,580
What trouble?

321
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,940
He just wants a son.

322
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,020
Smarty pants.

323
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,980
You'll understand when you grow up.

324
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,940
I need to eat more to grow up faster.

325
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,700
I don't have enough to eat.

326
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,620
I'll cook you good food
in a few days, ok?

327
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,820
Okay.

328
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,420
I'll apologize to Mom.

329
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,420
Mom,

330
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,020
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,660
Look.

332
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,780
Your daughter apologized to you.

333
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,700
You should be generous.

334
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,980
Today,

335
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,140
I was wrong, too.

336
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,020
He Jiali,

337
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,540
you're willing to apologize.

338
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,100
Learning from your mistakes,

339
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,900
you're a smart girl.

340
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,220
You're a girl.

341
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,020
A girl should act like a girl.

342
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,380
Don't be wild all day long.

343
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
You're our eldest daughter.

344
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,180
You should help out around the house

345
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,300
and help Mom

346
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,620
take care of your sisters.

347
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,220
Yes.

348
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,380
From now on,

349
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,380
whatever you want to eat,

350
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,100
tell Mom and Dad.

351
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,420
Don't steal food again.

352
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,420
I see.

353
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,980
Mom,

354
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,940
may you give Dad a son soon.

355
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,860
Did you teach her that?

356
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,820
No, I didn't.

357
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

358
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,260
You do want a son.

359
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,780
Why do you scold me?

360
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,660
(Fortune)

361
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,460
Who is it? I'm coming.

362
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,250
Who?

363
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,620
Where is the suspect?

364
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,420
Give me the suspect!

365
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
What suspect?

366
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,940
You...

367
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,500
Mrs. He, look.

368
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,820
His head is broken.

369
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,900
It's bleeding.

370
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,940
We must settle the score.

371
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,620
It's your granddaughter's fault.

372
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,620
She's only been here a few days.

373
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,140
She's like a mobster!

374
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
What are you talking about?

375
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,060
Who is a mobster?

376
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,340
That's a terrible thing to say.

377
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,220
What's wrong?

378
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,580
Changsheng,

379
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,980
(Mrs. Tang)
Your daughter hurt my son.

380
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,180
Look.

381
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,380
Look.

382
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,940
His head is broken.

383
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,340
You must give me an answer.

384
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,820
What should we do?

385
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,580
Jiali.

386
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,060
Jiali!

387
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,900
Did you do it?

388
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,740
Be honest!

389
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,620
- Not really.
- You're still lying!

390
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,820
Let her talk.

391
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,980
Yes.

392
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,940
They wouldn't let me go home.

393
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,340
They said they'd hurt me.

394
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,540
I gave him a little shove.

395
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,980
He fell over himself.

396
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,300
I don't know what happened then.

397
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,340
Yes, I did...

398
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,180
Don't talk!

399
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,980
Did you hear her?

400
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,580
Did you?

401
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,800
She gave him a shove!

402
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,100
Jiali,

403
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,020
apologize to Weimin.

404
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,180
Why do I have to apologize again?

405
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,980
Changsheng,

406
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,060
this isn't about apologizing.

407
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,540
It could be big

408
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
or small.

409
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
Today,

410
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,780
I'm going to be frank no matter what.

411
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,820
If your daughter

412
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,380
hurt my son's brain,

413
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,220
what should we do?

414
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,440
Tell me.

415
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,380
How can we still live our lives?

416
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,940
We have mercurochrome.

417
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,260
I think it's just a scratch.

418
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,460
I'll put it on him to sterilize it.

419
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,300
Mrs. He,

420
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,700
it's more than a scratch.

421
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,900
On the surface,

422
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,380
it's a scratch.

423
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,420
But what about his brain?

424
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,900
Is it hurt?

425
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,540
If it's hurt,

426
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,820
who of you will be responsible?

427
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,980
Jiali,

428
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
apologize.

429
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,300
I didn't do anything wrong.

430
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,820
They bullied me.

431
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,140
I fought back in self-defense.

432
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,980
Apologize!

433
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,890
I'm sorry.

434
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,420
Be more sincere.

435
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,740
I'm sorry.

436
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,980
Go shake hands with Weimin.

437
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,580
Come on. Let's make up.

438
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,700
I didn't tell on you.

439
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,540
Look, the kids have made up.

440
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,520
Weimin,

441
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,540
why couldn't you fight a girl?

442
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,700
My son

443
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,740
is always a good student.

444
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,020
He's never fought.

445
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,740
There are terrible people in this world.

446
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,180
It's hard for him when he sees

447
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,460
others have something

448
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,780
that he doesn't have.

449
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,380
Why are you so harsh?

450
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,620
She apologized. What else do you want?

451
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
It isn't enough!

452
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,180
I'll tell you what,

453
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,820
I'll get Weimin
some lard for his recovery.

454
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,180
Mom!

455
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,580
Weimin, here.

456
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,620
Lard, to help you get well.

457
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,780
Take it.

458
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,860
- Here.
- Take it!

459
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,020
Alright.

460
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,240
Any aftereffects,

461
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,700
I'll come back to you.

462
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,260
Go.

463
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,340
Remember to bring our bowl back.

464
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
Well done.

465
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,140
The lard is gone.

466
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,940
Stand in the yard for the night.

467
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,300
There, there.

468
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,780
Get inside with Grandma.

469
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,220
Grandma, where are we going?

470
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,740
I promised to get you good food, right?

471
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,540
Grandma, what's this?

472
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,380
Is it edible?

473
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,700
Common sowthistle, yes.

474
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,540
Jiali, here.

475
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,980
Later, we'll get some fiddlehead

476
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,980
and fat hen.

477
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,180
They're all edible.

478
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,300
Here.

479
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,900
Don't use too much.

480
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,740
Yes.

481
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
Mom, what's this?

482
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,100
Can we eat it? I've never seen it.

483
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,500
Yes, it's very nutritious.

484
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,540
Nutritious?

485
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,380
Not bad.

486
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,980
Look how your sister is enjoying it.

488
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,020
Jiali, don't just eat the food.

489
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,860
Have some soup.

490
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,980
Not bad, huh?

491
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,580
It's pieced together from cloth scraps.

492
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,260
But it's good quality.

493
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,100
Look.

494
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,500
Look at the lining.

495
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,220
Alright, alright.

496
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,540
How about this?

497
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,660
Tomorrow,

498
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,620
I'll set sail.

499
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,340
- I'll ask around when I get there.
- Okay.

500
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,020
But let's get this straight.

501
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,740
This thing

502
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,620
is a tough sell.

503
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,100
It's hard to trade for pork coupons.

504
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,500
You have to be patient.

505
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,580
No, I...

506
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,660
I can wait, but my wife can't.

507
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,820
She is eager to have pork.

508
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,980
If she doesn't,

509
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,420
her heart palpitates.

510
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,380
She says she has no strength

511
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,220
and doesn't feel well.

512
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,380
If I didn't get her any pork,

513
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,700
she would probably eat me.

514
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,180
Alright, you know,

515
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,260
here's a coupon for one jin of pork.

516
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,860
I got it for someone else.

517
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,820
You take it and get some pork.

518
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,260
Your wife's health matters.

519
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
Take it.

520
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,620
Okay, it's better than nothing.

521
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,220
Why are you still up?

522
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,940
Guess what I've got?

523
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,980
What?

524
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,580
Undo it.

525
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,860
- What?
- Take it out.

526
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,340
Just one? One jin.

527
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,340
We're lucky.
If it weren't for Zhu Laoda,

528
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,620
(Pork Coupon)
we wouldn't have this.

529
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,980
I'll try to get some more.

530
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,660
Don't worry. If I can,

531
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,380
I'll definitely get it for you.

532
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,060
Otherwise, how can we

533
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,460
run our production cooperative?

534
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,140
Soil fertility is important for crops.

535
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,100
Get out.

536
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,180
It's the seeds that matter.

537
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,660
Mom.

538
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,220
You're back.

539
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,500
Where have you been?

540
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,260
I got in line, but it was too long.

541
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,420
I didn't get any.

542
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,180
What?

543
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,380
Pork.

544
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,820
Mom, I have an early shift tomorrow.

545
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,860
Would you go redeem it?

546
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,820
Sure.

547
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,460
Is it pork? I'll go.

548
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,060
You naughty girl,

549
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,580
what do you think you can do?

550
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,980
She can do it.

551
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,580
She redeemed some other things.

552
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Mom, Grandma, rest assured.

553
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,660
I promise to finish the job.

554
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,140
Come on. Let me see.

555
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,940
(Long live Chairman Mao
Strive for greatness)

556
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,500
(Develop the economy
Cooperative)

557
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,700
Hello, ma'am.

558
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,620
How much is the pork?

559
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,820
Where are you parents?

560
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,690
They'll be here soon.

561
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,780
I came to get in line first.

562
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,980
Here it is. Here's the pork.

563
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,460
In a day,

564
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,660
only ten people at most

565
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,060
can get some pork.

566
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,780
Nine.

567
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,980
Ten.

568
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,940
What should we do?

569
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,260
Not necessarily.

570
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,340
Let's just wait.

571
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,580
Hey,

572
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,140
why are you cutting in line?

573
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,060
We've been waiting for long.

574
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,300
Do you see it?

575
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,500
- What?
- Do you think it's a footrest?

576
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,260
This is my mark in line.

577
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,020
I was here before you arrived.

578
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,260
- It can't replace you.
- I had to go home.

579
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,940
- Got it?
- Got what?

580
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,860
You're being unreasonable.

581
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,220
I was telling you the reason.

582
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,800
She's unbelievable.

583
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,940
I can't believe there's such a person.

584
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,780
That's true.

585
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,540
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

586
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,260
Thanks.

587
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,180
Do you have any more pork?

588
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,540
In 15 days.

589
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,740
Leave, guys.

590
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,580
What should we do?

591
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,460
I can't believe it.

592
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,060
- Let's go.
- Little girl,

593
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,820
why don't you go home?

594
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,660
Sir, is there any more pork?

595
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,220
Didn't you hear me? It's sold out.

596
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,260
Look at how skinny I am.

597
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,420
Do me a favor,

598
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,700
would you?

599
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,140
That's all I have.

600
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,180
Do you want it?

601
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,100
This...

602
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,460
Why are you looking at me?

603
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,860
It's pork, too.

604
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,140
How much does this weigh?

605
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,100
Well,

606
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,460
I've never weighed it before.

607
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,260
How about this?

608
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,820
Make it two liang and write it down.

609
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,420
Next time,
I'll get the other eight liang.

610
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,660
Smart girl.

611
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,180
Okay.

612
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,180
Is it cooked?

613
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,340
Come here.

614
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,340
It smells good.

615
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,540
Have a taste.

616
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,440
No, thanks.

617
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,220
- Come on.
- No, I'm not eating it.

618
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,700
Look.

619
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,500
The pigs are fat.

620
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
But why do they get such tiny tails?

621
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,940
Why are you cutting it up?

622
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,820
Season it.

623
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,260
Put it in your mouth

624
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,740
and eat it up.

625
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,300
We must share it.

626
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,220
What a pity.

627
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,060
She went early in the morning

628
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,020
but came back with this.

629
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,460
And she used the coupon.

630
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,060
When push comes to shove,

631
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
girls just aren't as good as boys.

632
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,960
Jiali.

633
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,700
Open the door!

634
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,260
- Open the door!
- Who is it? Stop it!

635
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,340
Who?

636
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,300
It's He's first daughter.

637
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,140
Mrs. Tang,

638
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,740
give me the pork you got by cheating.

639
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,020
Who cheated?

640
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,540
Didn't I make it clear to all of you?

641
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,060
Why don't you understand anything?

642
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,300
Go back home.

643
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,940
If you don't give me back the pork,

644
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,900
I'm not leaving.

645
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,860
Are you blackmailing me?

646
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,020
What if I don't give it to you?

647
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,860
It's our pork.

648
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,300
I find your family is funny.

649
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,220
When you couldn't get any pork,

650
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,100
you sent a little girl to harass me.

651
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
Fine!

652
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,740
I'll see

653
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,100
what you can do to me.

654
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,260
Mom,

655
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,980
Dad let me come out and check.

656
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,460
He's waiting for you to bring the food.

657
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,680
What a bad time.

658
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,900
Coming.

659
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,060
When push comes to shove,

660
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,940
girls just aren't as good as boys.

661
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,900
Little girl,

662
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,660
do you really want to cut your braid?

663
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,820
Cut it and you can have it.

664
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,900
What I mean is,

665
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,860
it doesn't look good

666
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,420
if it's too short.

667
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,460
I don't want it to look good.

668
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,700
I want it short,

669
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,660
as short as a boy's hair.

670
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,540
Alright.

671
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,300
Okay.

672
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,860
I'm cutting it.

673
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,940
Jiali?

674
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,940
It's really you.

675
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,420
What are you doing?

676
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,860
Why are you sitting here alone at night?

677
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,860
And you cut your hair so short.

678
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,260
I didn't even recognize you.

679
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,980
What's wrong?

680
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,460
Who bullied you?

681
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,700
Say something.

682
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,100
Dad,

683
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,260
do you think girls are useless?

684
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,060
No. When did I say that?

685
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,540
Do you want a son?

686
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,460
Why do you ask?

687
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,300
Yes, I've always wanted a boy. Why?

688
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,260
Boys are different from girls.

689
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Boys

690
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,020
can stay at home.

691
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,220
Girls can stay at home too.

692
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,060
Girls will get married eventually.

693
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,340
They'll join their husbands' families.

694
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,340
I won't get married.

695
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,540
Nonsense.

696
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,340
All girls will get married.

697
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,260
You'll also get married
when you grow up.

698
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,260
How can a family not have a boy?

699
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,340
Without a boy,

700
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,500
the whole family will be bullied.

701
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,820
Dad,

702
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,100
you can raise me as a boy.

703
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,940
I'm better than a boy.

704
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,300
I'll fight anyone who dares to bully us.

705
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,860
I'll protect you,

706
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,940
Mom,

707
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,660
Grandma, and my sisters,

708
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,500
ok?

709
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,150
Okay.

710
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
Why did you cut your hair?

711
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,540
Do I look like a boy?

712
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,160
Yes.

713
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,140
You look good.

714
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,020
Really good.

715
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Did you go cut it yourself?

716
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,620
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

717
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,180
Where?

718
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,620
There's good food.

719
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,420
- Yes.
- Go.

720
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,620
Don't eat it all.

721
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
When you want to come,

722
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,420
we'll come again, ok?

723
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,740
Okay.

724
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,700
Ok?

725
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,340
You have to ask Mr. Zhu

726
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,780
and see if he agrees.

727
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,460
Eat as much as you want.

728
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,260
I can tell

729
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,500
you're biased.

730
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,140
Later...

731
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,220
Later,

732
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,140
she won many great battles.

733
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,860
At last, Hua Mulan became a general.

734
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,220
- Grandma.
- We're back.

735
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,300
What happened?

736
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,660
Come on. Let me see.

737
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,420
She had lice,

738
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,700
so she cut her hair.

739
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,140
It'll grow back.

740
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,620
There's hair all over you.

741
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,300
Hurry up and get changed.

742
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Is Meixin asleep?

743
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,500
What happened?

744
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,180
She wanted to be a boy

745
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,740
so she could protect our family.

746
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,300
This girl

747
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,780
has a delicate mind.

748
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,780
(Early 1965)

749
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,580
(Never forget the Communist Party)

750
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,660
What are you doing?

751
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,100
Let me help you.

752
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,180
I can do it myself.

753
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,700
The water's deep. You may fall.

754
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,180
Give me.

755
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,780
Let's make a deal, then.

756
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,620
If we get two, one for each.

757
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,940
Ok.

758
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,220
Don't tell anyone.

759
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,660
Whoever says anything is a traitor.

760
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,700
You have my word.

761
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,060
I'm home.

762
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,500
Nice working together.

763
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,900
Weimin.

764
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,060
Why don't you come home?

765
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,180
What are you doing?

766
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,500
I got something in my eye.

767
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,100
Let me see.

768
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,620
Open it.

769
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,060
Open it.

770
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,860
Do it.

771
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,540
(Tang Youmin, Tang's second son)

772
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,940
Mom!

773
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,780
What's wrong?

774
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,300
Mom, it hurts.

775
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,460
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

776
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,300
It hurts.

777
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,580
What happened to your hand?

778
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,420
What's wrong?

779
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,860
The turtle bit me.

780
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,100
- Give me...
- Where did you get it?

781
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,420
I caught it

782
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,020
with He Jiali.

783
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,140
With her again?

784
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,340
That little devil.

785
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,420
Get up.

786
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,580
Keep an eye on him.

787
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,860
- I'm going to see her.
- Mom, Mom!

788
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,740
Don't go.

789
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,820
- Mom!
- Let go!

790
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,740
Don't go.

791
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,820
- Let go!
- Mom, don't go!

792
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,260
- Let go!
- Don't go!

793
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,180
- Mom!
- What's wrong?

794
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,860
It's He Jiali's fault.

795
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,820
Look.

796
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,980
Youmin's fingers

797
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,180
got bitten!

798
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,580
Did she bite him?

799
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
The turtle bit him.

800
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,720
Where did you get the turtle?

801
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,580
I caught it.

802
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,380
You're lying. He Jiali gave it to you!

803
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,020
Turtle?

804
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,580
It's very nutritious.

805
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,300
Where did you get it?

806
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,420
I caught it this morning.

807
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,260
You caught it?

808
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,230
It's real meat.

809
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,460
Of course.

810
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,020
You're what you eat.

811
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,460
What do you mean?

812
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,580
You'll know when you eat it.

813
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,900
You can do it when you eat it.

814
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
Mom.

815
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,340
- Who is it?
- Someone is knocking.

816
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,500
(Follow the Party)

817
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,390
(He Jiawen, He's second daughter,
He Jiayi, He's third daughter)

818
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,940
We're from
the Market Management Office.

819
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,180
The people report

820
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,380
that you have a bourgeois lifestyle.

821
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,060
You undermine socialism

822
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,580
- and take the capitalist road.
- Take your sister inside.

823
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,580
Comrade, how can you say that?

824
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,180
We're working people.

825
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,660
- Yes, we...
- We...

826
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,980
- Exactly.
- We are the working class.

827
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,780
- That's right.
- Then what are you holding?

828
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,380
Well...

829
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,820
What's this?

830
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,380
It crawled in a couple of days ago.

831
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,460
When it was raining,

832
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,660
it crawled in through the door.

833
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,540
Comrades,

834
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,780
they undermine
the cornerstone of socialism.

835
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,660
You must arrest these bad guys.

836
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,940
Yes, arrest them.

837
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,780
Yeah.

838
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,540
Don't listen to her nonsense.

839
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,460
It isn't true.

840
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,380
No, she doesn't have any proof.

841
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,300
Of course I do.

842
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,900
Here is the witness.

843
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,740
Son,

844
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,740
don't be afraid.

845
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,630
