What are you talking about?

Aren't you satisfied or comfortable?

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,500
Can you bear that old home?

18
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,330
Fine, fine.

19
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,450
This problem is solved.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,180
Next is your job problem.

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,780
Right. I need a job.

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,260
Or how can we live a comfortable life?

23
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,780
Agreed. Totally agreed.

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,460
How about you get your old job back?

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,020
That's also what I'm thinking.

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,980
I'm looking for a job.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,380
Sihai Mall is recruiting.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
That's a good job.

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,780
You'll do great as a shop assistant.

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,180
I know it's good.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,740
Even regular workers
have to pull some strings.

32
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,100
How can I get the job

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,180
when we don't know anyone?

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,140
Shall we ask Jianguo?

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,660
He isn't as powerful as before.

36
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,580
If he had connections,

37
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,790
Jiali wouldn't be selling vegetables.

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,980
Are you ok if I sell vegetables?

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,140
Yes. Why would I not?

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,340
Isn't it humiliating?

41
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,580
It's not humiliating.

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,740
A state cadre doesn't think.

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,820
Why would I think like that?

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,460
You'll make money with your skills.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,660
Every job is decent.

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220

- Jiawen.
- Really great pain.

Be strong.

68
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,260
Be brave.

69
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,100

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,940
Ok.

72
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,420
I'm here to see you.

73
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,780
Lie back there.

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,780
Jiali.

75
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,420
Don't worry.

76
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,820
Keep the therapy and you'll get well.

In my life,

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,460
I've never achieved anything.

82
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,220
Weiguo, you're a nice guy.

83
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,820
Under such circumstances,

84
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,060
however strong I am,

85
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,980
it won't help.

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,780
Rest assured. Unless I'm dead,

87
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,020
Jiawen will never starve.

Sleeping?

89
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,620
Another day in the chair.

90

Come on.

91
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,100
You have to live, anyway.

92
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,220
Here. Have something to eat.

93
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,060
Why? Leave me alone, will you?

94
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,500
If you have a death wish, die outside!

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,900
You're a man!

96
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,980
Will you so easily collapse?

97
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,180
I'm doomed.

98
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,900
I can't rise again.

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,020
You're doomed?

100
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,980
You won't rise again?

101
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,820
What about your son?

102
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,820
What about your wife?

103
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,580
What about your dead father?

104
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,700
What about your brothers?

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,580
Will you just watch them

106
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,860
collapse with you?

107
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Unless you give up,

108
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,620
no one can say you failed!

Ouyang,

110
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,420
you still have me.

111
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,580
When we work together,

112
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,020
we can do anything.

113
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,620
Nothing is impossible to overcome.

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,500
In the worst case,

115
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,020
we'll start from a small business.

116
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,620
One day, we'll rise again.

117
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,980
Weiguo, don't worry.

118
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,300
Guangming is my only nephew.

119
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,980
I'll take good care of him.

120
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,660
He's the only heir

121
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,020
of our family, too.

122
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Rest assured.

123
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,860
I'll cover

124
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,460
all his expenses.

125
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,540
Weiguo.

126
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,780
Weiguo.

127
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,260
Tell me what you want to say.

128
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,900
I always take you as my real brother.

129
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,060
Guangming.

130
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,820
Guangming? Don't worry.

131
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,620
Your brother and I

132
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,860
will always take good care of him.

133
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,580
Guangming

134
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,380
will go to middle school

135
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,140
in two months.

136
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,660
Ok.

137
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
Your brother will pull some strings.

138
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,020
Guangming will go
to the best middle school.

139
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,140
That's right.

140
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,500
Don't worry.

141
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,140
Count on me.

142
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,580
I'll pull some strings.

143
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,180
Thank you, brother.

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,820
I wonder how Weiguo is doing.

145
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,100
He may leave in a day or two.

146
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,820
Jiawen is so miserable.

147
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,700
Everybody has his destiny.

148
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,820
Mom, Jiawen isn't like Xiaoling.

149
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,820
Xiaoling is divorced.

150
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,020
Yangyang has a father, after all.

151
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,500
His family sometimes supports her.

152
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,020
But Jiawen...

153
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,900
We'll see.

154
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,860
After Weiguo dies,

155
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,420
his family will ignore her.

156
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,620
Poor Jiawen.

157
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,460
In the future,

158
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,580
she won't get along
with Weiguo's family.

159
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,500
I don't think so.

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,020
Guangming is there.

161
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,500
He's one of that family.

162
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,020
And he's the only boy in that family.

163
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,780
Hello.

164
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,460
What's up?

165
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,460
Fang Tao.

166
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,100
Fang Tao.

167
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,460
Stop reading. Get up.

168
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,580
Why? A humble taxi driver like me

169
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,060
can't even read a book?

170
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,180
We'll drive Guangming to hospital.

171
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,460
Weiguo...

172
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,580
Jiali just called.

173
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,860
Hurry.

174
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,420
Zhicheng, Dad and Mom will be back soon.

175
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,620
Zhicheng, whoever knocks,

176
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,460
don't open the door.

177
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,620
(Ward 2)

178
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,860
Dad.

179
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,980
Dad.

180
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,820
Dad.

181
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
Dad.

182
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,260
Dad.

183
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,860
Son.

184
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,260
There you are.

185
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,340
Dad

186
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,540
can't accompany you when you grow up.

187
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
Dad.

188
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,900
Don't cry.

189
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,220
Wherever Dad is,

190
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,020
I'll always love you.

191
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,980
Listen to your mom.

192
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,700
We...

193
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,300
We'll meet again.

194
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,580
Dad.

195
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,780
It's about time.

196
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,580
Now I finally know

197
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,260
a good appetite is a blessing.

198
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,860
Hope is for living people.

199
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,180
Too bad for Weiguo.

200
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,180
He died at such a young age.

201
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,260
Honey, don't worry.

202
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,900
We'll be successful again.

203
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,780
Dad, Mom.

204
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,940
Why are you still up?

205
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,220
I'm hungry.

206
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,140
Hungry?

207
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,220
You can't eat, anyway.

208
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,460
Look how plump you are.

209
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,180
He has to eat.

210
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,380
He's too hungry to sleep.

211
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,860
Come on.

212
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,700
What if he gets fat?

213
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
I'll be responsible.

214
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,100
Tomorrow morning, we'll play basketball

215
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,020
and do some exercise.

216
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,420
Sit down. Eat my food.

217
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,380
Thank you, Dad.

218
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,620
Don't thank me. Thank Mom.

219
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,820
Fine. I'll make you something to eat.

220
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,300
Don't eat your dad's food.

221
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,100
Go ahead.

222
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,820
Stir it.

223
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,580
Only the good die young.

224
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,140
The wicked always live.

225
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Someone should have died.

226
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,220
Someone shouldn't have.

227
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,900
Who should have died?

228
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,700
A lot.

229
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,940
What kind of question is that?

230
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,820
Don't make me the bad guy.

231
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I think

232
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,820
Weiguo's death illustrates something.

233
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,740
What is it?

234
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,540
People shouldn't do business.

235
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,740
He fell sick during his trip to Sichuan.

236
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,100
It has nothing to do with business.

237
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,740
A lot of people make a fortune.
What about that?

238
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,220
I hear Xiaoling

239
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,500
has been selling a lot
in the East Market.

240
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,500
You just try so hard to keep me at home.

241
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,060
Huan,

242
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,620
are you as good as your word?

243
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,260
Be specific.

244
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,620
You said you'd never change.

245
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,620
I won't change, of course.

246
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,500
But anyway,

247
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,980
you're mostly to blame.

248
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,500
You can't be jealous unreasonably.

249
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,620
You should trust me.

250
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,460
Yes.

251
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,780
I was wrong.

252
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,660
I shouldn't have been jealous.

253
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,260
Zhang Qiulin shouldn't adore you...

254
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,100
Fang Tao,

255
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,700
will you stop it?

256
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,380
Didn't you see how sad Jiawen was?

257
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,020
Weiguo's death tells us

258
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,660
all we want is to stay healthy

259
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,460
and live a normal life.

260
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,620
That matters most.

261
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,620
Huan,

262
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,220
you're right.

263
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,220
We must stay alive.

264
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,900
We must live a great life.

265
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,100
Fang Tao.

266
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,140
Distinguished Ms. He Jiahuan,

267
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,900
welcome.

268
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,340
Be seated, please.

269
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,940
This is your favorite wine.

270
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
And this is

271
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,620
the steak I made

272
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,820
for you.

273
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,580
What day

274
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,060
is it today?

275
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,540
You made Western food.

276
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,940
Seven years ago today,

277
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,580
I made the first meal for you.

278
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,220
There were also two fried eggs

279
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,140
with a little soy sauce.

280
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,460
The fried egg

281
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,940
with a little soy sauce

282
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,100
will taste great.

283
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,860
Jiahuan.

284
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,140
I know

285
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,740
I have many problems.

286
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm especially narrow-minded.

287
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,340
Whatever mistake I make in the future,

288
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,660
criticize me as much as you can.

289
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,500
Discipline me as you wish.

290
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,260
You should not only
correct your mistake,

291
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,340
but also make me more food.

292
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,020
I will, of course.

293
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,220
Come on.

294
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,220
In the wrong hands.

295
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,500
How is it cooked?

296
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,660
You should trust my cooking skills.

297
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,620
It's well done.

298
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,740
It should be medium.

299
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,420
Don't eat this.

300
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,300
Local free-range eggs.

301
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,340
I just fried them.

302
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,820
A much better taste. Try some.

303
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,060
Tastes great.

304
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,220
Jiahuan,

305
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,300
I'm grateful for meeting you

306
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,700
seven years ago today.

307
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,700
This month, we finally
made our money back.

308
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,380
Great. Let's split the money, Lu.

309
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,660
You're so impatient.

310
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,940
This is your share.

311
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,580
Take it.

312
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,160
- What is it?
- It's your money.

313
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,900
Come on, Lu.

314
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,500
We agreed to split it into halves.

315
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,260
You take a lot while I take a little?

316
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,300
Maozi, check this note.

317
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,740
Xiaoling, we agreed

318
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,980
to split the net profit in halves.

319
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,300
Think about who

320
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,340
rented this store.

321
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,500
The area.

322
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,340
The location.

323
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,060
Without my boyfriend,

324
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,700
we couldn't have rented it

325
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,900
without a hundred thousand.

326
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Why didn't you clarify it before?

327
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,300
We agreed
to split the money into halves.

328
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,460
We each will take a half.

329
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
Is it right when you take a lot

330
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,260
while I take a little?

331
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,380
Besides, I brought back the clothes.

332
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,580
It's so hard for me

333
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,940
to run around and tend the store.

334
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,700
Stop. How can you say
you brought back the clothes?

335
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,500
Have a conscience, ok?

336
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,900
I picked the hot sales.

337
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,660
Look. Look at those you picked.

338
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,460
They don't sell well at all.

339
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,180
You need an eye for fashion.

340
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,900
And this week, I also
attended the store for three days.

341
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,700
You take 30% and I take the same.

342
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,500
We should leave 10% for the store.

343
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,340
The last 30%
should be used for the bribe.

344
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,700
I should bother to say this.

345
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,940
You've been working here
for only a few days.

346
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,180
You don't know how complicated it is.

347
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,540
You know what?

348
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,060
You need to get along
with all the powers when doing business.

349
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,860
Do you think you can earn money

350
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,060
just by standing there?

351
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,060
If you aren't convinced,

352
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,180
try doing business alone.

353
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,540
- But...
- What will we have for dinner?

354
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,420
The same old thing.

355
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,260
Let's go.

356
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,940
Meixin,

357
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,340
what are you doing?

358
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,140
Tearing down the cage.

359
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,100
Only two chickens. We'll eat them.

360
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,500
Anyway, Weiguo is gone.

361
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,910
There won't be any more fodder.

362
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,500
When he's gone,

363
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,660
you won't raise the chickens?

364
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,180
No.

365
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,900
Can Jiawen

366
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,620
raise her son

367
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,980
all by herself?

368
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,140
Years ago,

369
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,300
when Changsheng died,

370
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,660
I would rather kill myself.

371
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,100
But year after year,

372
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,460
I've been living until now.

373
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,540
There's no comparison. You have me.

374
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,340
That's right.

375
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,660
Jiawen is only in her thirties.

376
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,540
She can't live alone like that.

377
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,460
We should help her.

378
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,800
♪The sun rests on the sea♪

379
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:11,830
♪The sky steals the night and day♪

Mom, you don't do that.

393
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,060
You may get an electric shock.

394
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,460
It's ok. I saw your dad fix that.

395
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,100
I just need to pull down the fuse.

396
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,420
Are you wearing insulating gloves?

397
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,560
Yes.

398
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,460
I'll pull the switch, too.

399
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,660
Mom, the light came back.

400
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,660
Jiawen has lost weight. So has her son.

401
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,260
She has to work
and looks after Guangming.

402
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,540
She's way too busy.

403
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,140
Weiguo is dead. She must be sad.

404
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,060
Guangming is young.

405
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,820
Life is really hard.

406
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,660
When he grows up, it will be better.

407
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,900
Jiawen needs a helper, I believe.

408
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,460
Do you think Mom will help her?

409
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,540
Jiawen is her daughter. She has to go.

410
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,140
Talk to her when she's back.

411
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,100
I'll help to persuade her.

412
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,140
Hello.

413
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,020
Mom.

414
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,140
You're back.

415
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,460
- Come on.
- It's ok.

416
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,300
Leave it to me.

417
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,900
Mom.

418
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm back.

419
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,740
How did it go today?

420
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,540
How was your business?

421
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,020
Just so-so.

422
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,300
Have some water.

423
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,500
Ok.

424
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,460
Mom, I have something
to discuss with you.

425
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,060
Jiawen is really having a hard time.

426
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,740
Her factory had a reform.

427
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,980
Her schedule is very tight.

428
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,740
She can't make it all by herself.

429
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,060
Can you give her a hand?

430
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,860
Me?

431
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,660
You don't need to do too much.

432
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,100
Just make breakfast and dinner.

433
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,060
Two meals.

434
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,820
Guangming has lunch at her aunt's.

435
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,860
It's not about meals.

436
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,140
The point is, how can I leave?

437
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,060
Your grandma needs me and...

438
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,020
And my stall...

439
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,660
I just paid the rent.

440
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,740
If I don't sell pickled vegetables,

441
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,060
I'll lose a lot of money.

442
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,340
Don't bother about me.

443
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,860
Jiali stays at home.

444
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
As for your vegetables,

445
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,380
Jiali will sell them.

446
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,780
She can't.

447
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,380
Why can't I, Mom?

448
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,900
I can work for you.

449
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
I'll hand in all the income.

450
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,700
When you stay with Jiawen,

451
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,820
every month,

452
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,700
I'll give you another 150 yuan.

453
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,900
You'll all have extra food.

454
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,260
It's not about money.

455
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,860
My business has just been smooth.

456
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,100
Many customers

457
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,740
wait to see me every day

458
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,140
- and buy my vegetables.
- We know.

459
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,460
It's not that you won't come back.

460
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,940
You'll just help Jiawen for a while.

461
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,820
You should help your daughter.

462
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,340
That's right, Mom.

463
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,420
Jiawen is too shy to ask you.

464
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
So, I asked for her.

465
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
She and her son are really miserable.

466
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,260
I didn't mean I wouldn't help, Mom.

467
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,460
But...

468
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,340
She will get over it as time goes by.

469
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,860
- I also...
- What are you muttering?

470
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,220
Say no more. End of discussion.

471
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,100
Mom,

472
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,860
is the mattress too thin?

473
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,680
Shall I get you another thick one?

474
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
No. It's just ok.

475
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,860
It can't be too soft.

476
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,900
Bad for my waist.

477
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,740
Mom, thank you for this.

478
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,540
I can't be relieved
unless my daughters all live well.

479
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,940
Grandma, you're finally here.

480
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,500
Look. This is Lucky.

481
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,740
You can't put the dog on my bed.

482
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,460
It's a good dog.

483
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,860
Your school bag...

484
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,340
Have you packed

485
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,180
all your books?

486
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,380
Yes.

487
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,100
Be careful on your way.

488
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,060
Watch your step.

489
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,260
Hello.

490
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,820
If we do this,

491
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,260
will Guangming ignore us?

492
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,820
We're his aunts.

493
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,660
He won't.

494
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,980
Besides, we do this for his own good.

495
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,500
If Jiawen gets remarried

496
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,420
and discards Guangming,

497
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,780
what will he do?

498
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,620
I don't think
Jiawen is that kind of woman.

499
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,820
Things have changed.

500
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Who knows?

501
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,820
Guangming, come on.

502
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,060
Guangming, you should go home for lunch,

503
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
you know?

504
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,340
Otherwise,

505
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,540
your mother would discard you.

506
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,700
People can be so terrible.

507
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,900
How could his aunts say that?

508
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,420
Weiguo is gone.

509
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,420
Jiawen, you should be aware.

510
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,100
This is like a wake-up call.

511
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,220
In no way can you expect those guys

512
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,060
to take care of you.

513
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,820
I knew they would fall out with you.

514
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,260
I just didn't know
it would happen so early.

515
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,020
Isn't it obvious?

516
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,620
They're passing the buck.

517
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,420
If Jiawen gets remarried

518
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,260
and she can't take her son,

519
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,620
Guangming will have to live with them.

520
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,420
He'll be their burden, then.

521
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,100
This is their wicked idea.

522
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
I won't get remarried.

523
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,300
Even if I do,

524
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,860
I won't discard my son.

525
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,980
Humans are greedy.

526
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,100
Oh, Jiali.

527
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,420
What brings you here?

528
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,460
Take a seat. I'll get you some water.

529
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,020
Don't bother.

530
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,380
I'll just say something.

531
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,220
Ms. Chen,

532
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,060
on behalf of Jiawen,

533
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,620
I'm here to tell you this.

534
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,580
Guangming will go home for lunch.

535
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,060
He won't bother you.

536
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,580
Not at all.

537
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,900
He doesn't eat too much, anyway.

538
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,780
This isn't Jiawen's idea.

539
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,820
It's my idea.

540
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,580
Your idea?

541
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,820
I don't want Guangming to be tortured.

542
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,620
Jiali,

543
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,620
what are you talking about?

544
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,500
Even if you're worried

545
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,220
about something,

546
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,020
you shouldn't have
said that to Guangming.

547
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,700
Don't you feel ashamed?

548
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,260
What do you mean,

549
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,380
"Your mother will discard you"?

550
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,500
This kind of saying

551
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,420
will hurt Guangming a lot.

552
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,340
You're even a teacher.

553
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,860
Aren't you breaking the law?

554
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,260
Jiali,

555
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,300
you get me wrong.

556
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,420
Actually, that day,

557
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,420
I didn't say anything.

558
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,900
His second aunt blurted it out.

559
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,900
She didn't make it clear.

560
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,060
Be patient. Guangming is growing up.

561
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,420
Things will change, you know.

562
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,180
(Three months later)

563
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,860
Little mouse made of mugwort.

564
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,420
Smells so good.

565
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,340
Be safe and sound.

566
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,420
Go have fun.

567
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,860
The mugwort reminds me

568
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,060
of my father.

569
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,580
He always used it to soak his feet.

570
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,460
Mom,

571
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,260
how many years has Dad been dead?

572
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,580
I've never counted.

573
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,220
Take it easy. Everything will be fine.

574
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,660
As time goes by, you'll let it go.

575
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,180
One won't always be sad.

576
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,740
It will pass.

577
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,900
Speaking of this,

578
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,860
I understand you most.

579
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,020
- For my son.
- Don't.

580
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,740
You can't think that way.

581
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,980
You should first live for yourself.

582
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,720
I didn't realize that

583
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,060
until I lived the most of my life.

584
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,620
One has to make herself/himself comfortable

585
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,980
before satisfying anyone else.

586
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,140
When you're comfortable

587
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,580
while someone else isn't,

588
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,060
stick to yourself.

589
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,740
Ignore anyone else.

590
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
Think about Weiguo.

591
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,660
In the past,

592
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,580
he cared for everybody.

593
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,140
How did he end up?

594
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,100
Now, think

595
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,020
about his siblings.

596
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,780
He ran about for all their businesses.

597
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,260
What's the point?

598
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,540
Yes. When he's gone,
his siblings avoid us.

599
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,980
Things aren't what they used to be.

600
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,100
Get a second husband.

601
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,300
When you're still young

602
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,580
and beautiful.

603
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,620
Only I care for my own business.

604
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,860
I shouldn't have left it to Jiali.

605
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,180
Mom.

606
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,420
You're back.

607
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,860
Look what a mess

608
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,460
my vegetables are.

609
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,060
None of them is the right color.

610
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,620
Jiali did what you taught her.

611
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,660
The shades of colors vary too much.

612
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,140
Buyers won't accept that.

613
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,020
And she sold so little last month.

614
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,740
She nearly ruined my reputation.

615
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,180
Why don't you give her the recipe

616
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,980
so that she can perfectly follow?

617
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,660
Mom,

618
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,940
why have you lost so much weight?

619
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,180
Haven't had nice food?

620
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,540
What did Jiali make you?

621
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,980
Losing weight is great for old guys.

622
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,460
I'm doing good.

623
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,680
Mom,

624
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,580
let me be serious.

625
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,260
Jiawen can't fully count on me.

626
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,940
Her son is still young.

627
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,460
She needs a second husband.

628
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,420
But you didn't have a second husband.

629
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,740
I'm not like her.

630
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,780
I have six daughters.

631
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,740
Who could I remarry?

632
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,580
Who would want me?

633
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,020
Besides, I had you.

634
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,380
Thank you.

635
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
What's going on here?

636
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,380
You talk aloud.

637
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,060
Your mother is back.

638
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,260
Is everything ok?

639
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,380
Go get me some water.

640
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,740
Jiawen,

641
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,620
your grandma isn't
as energetic as before.

642
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,260
Your dad often asked me

643
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,780
to take care of your grandma.

644
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,820
When I'm away from her,

645
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,980
I'm really worried.

646
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,820
Mom.

647
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,980
You go back home.
I can handle everything.

648
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,180
You get me wrong.

649
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,220
I don't mean I'll leave immediately.

650
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,620
Jiawen.

651
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,220
I know you and Weiguo

652
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,940
were very close.

653
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,740
But he's dead.

654
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,540
You really have to move on.

655
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,100
Or a woman like you

656
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,580
will get no help or support.

657
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,420
Weiguo's siblings are selfish.

658
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,860
They avoid you.

659
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,260
In the future,

660
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,020
you need a lot of money for Guangming.

661
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,980
How can you handle that alone?

662
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,660
Mom.

663
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,020
Mom.

664
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,580
Keep the money.

665
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,940
I can't take your money.

666
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,260
It's not too much.

667
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,780
Take it. Just a little money.

668
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,260
Thank you for these days.

669
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,780
You're my daughter.

670
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,060
Don't say thank you.

671
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,460
You really have a hard time.

672
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,940
I take pity on you.

673
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,940
Luckily, Guangming is doing ok

674
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,260
and you've calmed down.

675
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,660
He'll have the middle school
entrance exam soon.

676
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,620
Life will be easier for you.

677
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,980
Just remember.

678
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,260
Tell us if you need anything.

679
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,860
We're always there for you.

680
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,140
I will.

681
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,540
Mom, why are you leaving so soon?

682
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,340
I thought you'd stay
for at least one year.

683
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,420
One year? That'll kill me.

684
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,820
What did Jiawen do to you?

685
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,140
Nothing.

686
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,380
I'm a guest at her place, after all.

687
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,220
I feel comfortable at my own home.

688
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,460
That's right. Come on.

689
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,500
Hey, you.

690
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,340
Make more money and buy your own flat.

691
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,380
Then raise your child carefully.

692
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,780
Don't bother about anything else.

693
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,620
You're right, Mom.

694
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,140
Let's wish Guangming academic success.

695
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,140
Our blessings.

696
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,660
- Congrats.
- Our blessings.

697
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,990
Guangming,

698
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,740
this is Great-grandma's.

699
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,780
Thanks, Great-grandma.

700
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
Thank you, Grandma.

701
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,260
Guangming, take mine.

702
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,020
- And mine.
- Thank you.

703
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,140
- Thank you.
- This is mine.

704
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,260
And this is mine.

705
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,740
Thanks, Aunt Jiali.

706
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,460
Guangming, this is my allowance.

707
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I don't need money in the army.

708
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,300
Keep it for me, then.

709
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,460
It's a little present from Xiaonian.

710
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,020
Thank you, Xiaonian.

711
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,540
Mom, you keep all this.

712
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,100
Ok.

713
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,140
Take it.

714
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,900
You need money

715
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,140
for tuition, life, and books.

716
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,780
You'll pay for accommodation, too.

717
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,180
He'll live in the dorm?

718
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,540
- Yes.
- The school is far away.

719
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,140
He can't commute to school.

720
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Jiawen, can he get used to that?

721
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,740
It'll be his experience.

722
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,020
He needs experience.

723
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,500
Look at your cousin. He's awesome.

724
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,580
He can live in the dorm.

725
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,220
If you don't study hard,

726
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,380
you'll live in the dorm, too.

727
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,020
Only a good school offers dorms.

728
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,900
If I don't study hard,

729
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,020
I can only go to a nearby school.

730
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,060
Who taught you to be so garrulous?

731
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,940
Yeah.

732
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,780
Let's eat.

733
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,700
