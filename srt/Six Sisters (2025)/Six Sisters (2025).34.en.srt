Jianguo.

16
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,940
You've had a hard time with me.

18
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:56,462
Not at all.

19
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,900
We've been through a lot.

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,820
When I'm with you, I enjoy everything.

21
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,540
Physical suffering isn't a problem.

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,620
Mental suffering drives people crazy.

23
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,420
Come on.

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,100
Now, we're destitute

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,660
and homeless.

26
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,020
We aren't homeless.

27
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,060
Wherever you are, where my home is.

28
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,780
Wherever we are,

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,860
that's our home.

30
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,460
As an old saying goes,

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,660
a mountain needn't be high.

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,060
A lake needn't be deep.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
Even if our flat is shabby,

34
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,300
I have you around at least.

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,780
Sir, here's your food.

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,660
Ok.

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,740
- Here.
I can't eat such a big piece.

38
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,860
You can.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,860
How shall I eat it?

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,100
Can I get some chopsticks?

41
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,060
Use the knife.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,220
It's like cutting vegetables at home.

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,700
Jianguo.

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,260
Thank you.

45
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,300
Don't say that.

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,220
This flower is for you.

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,420
This flower...

48
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,260
It's as beautiful as you.

49
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,060
Come on.

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,100
I'll cut it for you.

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,380
There you are, Jiawen.

52
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,830
Mom.

53
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,300
Jiawen.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,180
- Mom.
- You're here.

55
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,380
Jiawen, I'll make you some tea.

56
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,220
No need.

57
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,820
Mom.

58
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
I was passing by,

59
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,340
so I came to see you.

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,540
By the way,

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,220
I'll give you the money
for the festival.

62
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,300
No need.

63
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,940
Take it.

64
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,380
It's too early, Jiawen.

65
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,660
You can give it later.

66
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,820
Mom.

67
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,420
How will you celebrate this festival?

68
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,020
Umm...

69
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
Ask Jiaxi.

70
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,020
Me?

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,880
I...

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,780
I'll keep the door open

73
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,860
and welcome everyone.

74
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,620
But I'm afraid

75
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,820
someone is too ashamed to come.

76
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,660
Don't be nagging.

77
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,180
Who should be ashamed,

78
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,740
you or someone else?

79
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,020
Mom.

80
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,100
Here's the thing.

81
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,580
We'll have an inspection.

82
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,940
I'm too busy working to get away.

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,220
I guess I won't come back
for the festival.

84
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,780
Oh.

85
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,700
You take the money back.

86
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,620
Why?

87
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,460
You take it back.

88
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,980
It's for you.

89
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,420
Guangming can buy snacks with it.

90
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,820
He has enough money.

91
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,060
This is for the festival.

92
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,460
You must take it. Keep it.

93
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,380
Fine, then.

94
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,060
Mom,

95
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,660
still selling pickled vegetables?

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,860
It's like a workout.

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,380
Mom, don't sell them anymore.

98
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,580
See? Ignorant guys

99
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,340
may think I treat you poorly.

100
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,420
Ease up.

101
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,740
Take care of yourself.

102
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,620
- Ok.
- I should go.

103
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,460
Ok.

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,180
Mom, come back early.

105
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,740
I'll make you some fancy food.

106
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,180
Stay safe.

107
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,020
I will.

108
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,380
Let me walk you out.

109
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,220
No need.

110
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,220
Jiawen,

111
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,860
Jiali set you against me, huh?

112
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,900
Nobody did that.

113
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,060
After Grandma died,

114
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,740
Jiali kept getting Mom a new husband.

115
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,060
Mom even had grey hair for that.

116
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,860
That's Jiali's old trick.

117
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,420
She says something
but keeps the other half.

118
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,060
Jiawen, you must be judgmental.

119
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,860
Anyway,

120
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,300
Mom wouldn't lie, right?

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,380
If she lived happily with Jiali,

122
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,700
she wouldn't get me back.

123
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
Mom couldn't bear Jiali.

124
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,420
And I...

125
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
I had no choice.

126
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,860
You had no choice?

127
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,460
Don't you have selfish motives?

128
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,140
Yes. I have selfish motives.

129
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,580
For my daughter's education.

130
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,940
It's one of the reasons.

131
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,900
But everybody cares for her child.

132
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,060
Jiawen, don't you care for your son?

133
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,060
When is Guangming leaving?

134
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,700
Do you need Hongyu to drive him?

135
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,400
Tell me if you need it!

136
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,020
This flat is furnished.

137
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,020
It's old, though.

138
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,180
Just a transitional flat.

139
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,540
Sit.

140
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,860
Guangming is admitted to college.

141
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,580
His uncle and his aunt

142
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,620
didn't come over, did they?

143
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,660
No.

144
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,100
I guess they're traveling
after their retirement.

145
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,100
Glad they haven't come.

146
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,940
Your toughest time will be gone soon.

147
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,980
When Guangming graduates and gets a job,

148
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
you'll enjoy a great life.

149
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,420
That's years away.

150
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,460
I wouldn't even imagine.

151
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,900
Jiali,

152
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,060
I won't visit Mom
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

153
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,860
I gave her the money.

154
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,980
Jiaxi was so sarcastic.

155
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,180
How annoying.

156
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,460
You went there?

157
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,220
I visited Mom

158
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,260
when I was passing by.

159
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,460
Did Mom talk about me?

160
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,460
Jiaxi chattered all the time.

161
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,980
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

162
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,620
They didn't even call me.

163
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,940
I've moved out, anyway.

164
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm actually exiled.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,900
Neither of them

166
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,260
wants me back for the festival.

167
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,380
If Jiaxi wants that house alone,

168
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,660
I'll be the first to object.

169
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
When Mom lives there,

170
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,300
it's Mom's house.

171
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,600
When Mom is gone, it will be ours.

172
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,460
It's our right to get a share.

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,010
It's our love to give it up.

174
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,860
We must make a clear point.

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,140
What's gone is gone.

176
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,820
Let's move on.

177
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,740
Jianguo has his eye on a flat.

178
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,060
He does? Where is it?

179
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,420
A pre-owned house on Chinese Hong Kong Street.

180
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,380
The original owner

181
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,340
didn't live for a long time
after the decoration

182
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,740
and then he was in need of money.

183
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,060
So, we had a big bargain.

184
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,220
That's good.

185
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,140
I just think

186
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,540
this flat has many rooms.

187
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,660
That's right.

188
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,660
- It looks good.
- There's furniture, too.

189
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,700
This is a living room. This way.

190
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,920
- Another room in there.
- Ok.

191
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,260
Another room?

192
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,940
- It's big.
- Here's a room.

193
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,260
The kitchen is over there.

194
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,940
How many rooms?

195
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,860
Three bedrooms and two living rooms.

196
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,780
So many rooms?

197
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,420
And a yard is out there?

198
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,540
A good yard, huh?

199
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,220
- Good.
- It's big enough.

200
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,060
How much does it cost?

201
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,900
A hundred thousand.

202
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,420
What? A hundred thousand?

203
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,900
Jianguo, that's awesome.

204
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,420
Really awesome.

205
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,500
This flat is mortgaged.

206
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,500
Mom.

207
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,900
There you are.

208
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,380
Oh, a big meal.

209
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,260
Of course.

210
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,660
Why are you here alone?

211
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,740
What about Ouyang and Feng?

212
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,740
At Ouyang's brother's.

213
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,940
They can't enjoy the crab.

214
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,300
Mom.

215
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,260
How do you feel
when Jiaxi takes care of you?

216
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,180
Isn't that obvious?

217
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,220
Look at Mom.

218
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,900
Look at her mood and complexion.

219
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,140
She's doing great.

220
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,260
You've gained weight.

221
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,820
Mom.

222
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,180
Jiali...

223
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,300
Was she really expelled?

224
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,580
No. I didn't expel her.

225
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,660
She moved out.

226
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,540
We failed to stop her.

227
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,580
Is she coming back today?

228
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,700
Whether she comes back

229
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,540
is her own decision.

230
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,540
Mom,

231
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,140
let me remind you.

232
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,020
Whoever you live with,
keep something for yourself.

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,340
Even when you live with Jiaxi,

234
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,620
you can't give her your entire pension.

235
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,500
I've been keeping all my money.

236
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,780
I won't give it to anyone.

237
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,500
Didn't you go too far

238
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,820
by smashing the kitchen?

239
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,940
Liu Xiaoling,

240
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,660
if you're here to pick a fight,

241
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,940
get out of here.

242
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,060
And close the door.

243
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,300
Think about it.

244
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,420
Since you were back,
who has helped you most?

245
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,820
Who got you a job?

246
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,860
Who got you a flat?

247
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,620
Oh, you have a flat now.

248
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,420
Transfer your household registration

249
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,740
to your own flat.

250
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,780
Don't keep it here.

251
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,140
Why? Will this house be demolished?

252
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,660
Just transfer it anyway.

253
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,700
You can't interfere with Mom's house.

254
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,120
Don't worry.

255
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,700
I won't fight for the occupancy.

256
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,900
Liu Xiaoling!

257
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,100
What's all the yelling about?

258
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,420
I'll ignore her.

259
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,380
- I'm back.
- Jiahuan.

260
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,220
- Jiahuan.
- What about the other two?

261
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,420
At Fang Tao's brother's.

262
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,420
What happened, Mom?

263
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,020
Jiali moved out.

264
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,900
She said she would move out.

265
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,220
Jiaxi is so terrible.

266
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,820
She had the kitchen smashed.

267
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,500
To have it renovated.

268
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,300
Will Jiali come today?

269
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,380
Don't bring her up.

270
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,020
What about Jiawen?

271
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Not her, either.

272
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,220
It's the festival.

273
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,100
Few people are here.

274
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,620
How lonely.

275
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,540
I'll call Jiali and Jiawen.

276
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,180
Don't call them.

277
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,820
They decide

278
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,220
if they'll come.

279
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah. Mind the seniority.

280
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,780
Daughters visit their Mom.

281
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,020
Why would Mom visit them instead?

282
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,500
They're no longer young,

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,540
but they aren't sensible.

284
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,780
Jiaxi, ease up a bit.

285
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,860
Don't stare at me like that.

286
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,420
I told you.

287
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,260
You're all my daughters.

288
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,660
I've been fair

289
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,420
to every one of you.

290
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,620
If someday they care for me

291
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,780
and respect me,

292
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,580
they will come back.

293
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,420
If they don't, I won't care.

294
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,780
What exactly happened?

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,060
I don't know.

296
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,500
I've heard vague stories.

297
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,500
Jiali wanted to get Mom a husband.

298
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,980
Mom didn't want that.

299
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,500
So, they fell out.

300
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
What about the kitchen thing?

301
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,020
That happened too.

302
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,820
But those are surface things.

303
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,860
Inside, they just don't like each other.

304
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,740
Jiaxi shouldn't have smashed the kitchen

305
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,980
and kicked Jiali out.

306
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,820
How could she do that?

307
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,020
Yeah.

308
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,700
How could she do something so terrible?

309
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,200
We'll wait and see.

310
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,580
Besides,

311
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,700
when was Mom really fair?

312
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,220
It must be her own decision

313
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,620
to have Jiaxi move back.

314
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,180
River snails?

315
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,180
How does it taste?

316
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,380
There's still sand, Mom.

317
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,780
No way. I soaked them in water for days.

318
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
What's wrong?

319
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,780
Jiali...

320
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,020
She bought a flat.

321
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,500
Who told you that?

322
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,020
Neighbors are talking about that.

323
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,860
On Chinese Hong Kong Street.

324
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,220
Three bedrooms,
two living rooms, and a yard.

325
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,660
Does Jiali have no money?

326
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,020
She's just pretending.

327
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,620
She just won't give you any.

328
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,700
She's generous to herself.

329
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,860
Wait.

330
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,340
When did she buy it?

331
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,700
They've already moved in.

332
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,060
When do you think she bought it?

333
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,620
She kept saying I kicked her out.

334
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,860
Oh, He Jiali.

335
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,620
She should thank me.

336
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
If she hadn't left,

337
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,940
she wouldn't have such a big flat.

338
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,620
Mom,

339
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,860
guess how much it costs?

340
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,780
Guess wildly.

341
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
You'll never guess it.

342
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,620
Two hundred thousand.

343
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,740
He Jiali is really rich.

344
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,940
Did she never embezzle money?

345
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,140
Dad died and then Grandma died.

346
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,540
She didn't embezzle a penny?
Who'd believe that?

347
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,540
Your grandma had no pension.

348
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,500
Right, she didn't.

349
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,380
I know.

350
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,660
But every month, we gave her some.

351
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,540
The street office had an allowance
for 90-year-old people.

352
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,780
Where's the money?

353
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
It's a mess.

354
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,340
Thinking of that enrages me.

355
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,180
Let's eat.

356
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,220
We don't have money.

357
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,780
We must have a healthy body.

358
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,660
(East, Longhu Market)

359
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,540
(East, Longhu Market)

360
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Who are you?

361
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm the vice president
of Guangdong Shunde Tianyuan Food.

362
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,380
(Gao Zhiyong)
I'm here for business.

363
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,500
I happened
to taste your pickled vegetables.

364
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,220
I think these vegetables

365
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,380
have the potential
of massive production.

366
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,140
They can dominate the market.

367
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,340
What do you mean?

368
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,180
I mean we can cooperate.

369
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,100
You give us the recipe

370
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,580
when we'll produce them

371
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,180
and bring them to market.

372
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,180
It's a secret recipe.
It won't be shared.

373
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Got it.

374
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,660
I understand.

375
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,220
We can negotiate on the price.

376
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,020
I'll build a connection with you

377
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,140
before reporting it to our president.

378
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,620
If there's a next step,

379
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,580
I'll talk to you. What do you say?

380
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,500
Keep my name card.

381
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,700
I should go.

382
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,100
Mom, who's that guy?

383
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,260
He stood for a while
but didn't buy anything.

384
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,140
He asked for directions.

385
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,780
Well, he doesn't seem to be local.

386
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,020
Eat it.

387
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,020
Nine pieces.

388
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,060
Nine yuan.

389
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,820
Ok. Welcome back next time.

390
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,180
Business is good, Ms. Wang.

391
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,380
There you are.

392
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,100
Ms. Wang, I'd like to ask

393
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,660
if a decent man in a suit

394
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,540
visited my mother

395
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,500
just now.

396
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,740
Oh, yes.

397
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,380
Do you know who he is?

398
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,700
I don't want my mom to be deceived.

399
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,140
There have been too many frauds.

400
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,420
As far as I know,

401
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,780
he's here to buy recipes.

402
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,300
He asked several stallholders here.

403
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,580
For sesame oil,

404
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,860
pickled vegetables,

405
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,940
fried dough, and tofu...

406
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,420
He said he would do

407
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
the promotion and production

408
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,780
of intangible cultural heritage.

409
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,540
Oh, he wants recipes.

410
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,340
Something like that.

411
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,180
Isn't Mom silly?

412
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,020
Someone wanted to buy her recipe,

413
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,900
but she hesitated.

414
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,260
Then, that guy left.

415
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,540
We don't know if it's true.

416
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,660
Why isn't it true?

417
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,380
Now, people buy recipes

418
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,780
of intangible cultural heritage.

419
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,180
Do you remember Liu in the north?

420
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,220
He sold his recipe of beef soup.

421
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,820
Now, he's bought a flat.

422
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Isn't that great?

423
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,700
Then, let's wait.

424
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,660
This is destiny.

425
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,060
Mom is funny.

426
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,300
She keeps it from me.

427
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,540
Come on, she holds back something.

428
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,340
(Pickled cabbage, cucumber, radish)

429
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,740
Wouldn't you like more, Mom?

430
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,580
I'm full.

431
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,100
Wipe your hands, then.

432
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,300
Thanks.

433
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Here's some dried fruit.

434
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,700
Great service, isn't it?

435
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,540
It is.

436
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,620
Mom,

437
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,700
I also heard

438
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,100
Jiali's flat was mortgaged.

439
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,100
What?

440
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,540
It means she borrowed money from a bank

441
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,020
and will pay some interest.

442
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,320
If she can't pay,
her flat will be confiscated.

443
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,060
Who told you that?

444
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,540
Don't bother about that.

445
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,020
But I guess

446
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Jiali may come back to us.

447
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,220
Did she talk to you?

448
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,380
No.

449
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,020
But she won't give up on this house.

450
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,420
This house...

451
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,500
Unless I'm dead,

452
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,900
I'll always be in charge.

453
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,260
Yes, of course.

454
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,900
When I moved in,

455
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,740
I claimed

456
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,140
I would take care of you forever.

457
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,660
I'll take care

458
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,580
of your daily life

459
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,020
and health problems.

460
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,980
So,

461
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,620
in case of further trouble...

462
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,550
Mom,

463
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,940
transfer the deed of this house to me.

464
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,940
What's that look?

465
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,260
Grandma also said that.

466
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,740
You don't have a son.

467
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,900
You only have daughters.

468
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,860
Who takes care of you

469
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,980
will get this house.

470
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,740
Yes, she said that.

471
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,140
So, that's why Jiali

472
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,860
pretended to take care of you.

473
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,500
She wanted this house, didn't she?

474
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,300
She was kicked out,

475
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,940
so she must be feeling bad.

476
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,020
Now, she needs money.

477
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,780
She must be coveting this house.

478
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,940
So, we should do something first.

479
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,700
You should do something, right?

480
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,700
Right.

481
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,820
Mom,

482
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,780
I've never told you this.

483
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,340
All these years,

484
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,940
before and after I got married,

485
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,740
I've never had my own house.

486
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,300
I wonder if you can understand.

487
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,460
When I don't have my own house,

488
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,580
I feel really insecure.

489
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,940
Sometimes I'm thinking.

490
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,940
If I were as aggressive

491
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,340
and scheming as Jiali,

492
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,940
I might have had my own house.

493
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,540
And I would have moved you in with me.

494
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,260
Mom,

495
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,500
let me be honest.

496
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,700
Among your daughters,

497
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,300
who do you think

498
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,180
cares the most for you?

499
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,700
Say no more.

500
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,700
Now, Jiali has fallen out with us.

501
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,260
As for Jiawen,

502
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,540
she's always close to Jiali.

503
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,540
She must be partial, too.

504
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,100
You lived at Jiawen's place before.

505
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,180
Do you want to stay there?

506
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,460
Jiayi.

507
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,380
She's doing business.

508
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,260
She's way too busy.

509
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,620
She has no time for you.

510
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,980
And she never gets
the bad end of the stick.

511
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,820
Jiahuan is just free.

512
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,020
She's busy with her own stuff.

513
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,860
Think of Xiaoling.

514
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,100
We'd appreciate it

515
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,300
if she doesn't make trouble

516
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,380
and we needn't clean it up.

517
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,020
Mom,

518
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,860
seriously.

519
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,500
You only have me.

520
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,300
You brought me up personally.

521
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,540
I'm your little daughter.

522
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,980
We're the closest.

523
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,100
Let's forget about the house.

524
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,260
Even if you offer nothing,

525
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,940
I'll still take care of you forever.

526
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,140
Because I want to live with you.

527
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,660
I'll just live with you.

528
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,940
I want us to live together forever.

529
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,300
We need to tell your sisters

530
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,580
about this.

531
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,060
Mom,

532
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,380
this is your house.

533
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,500
You can do anything with it.

534
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,220
You can handle it as you wish.

535
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,740
It has nothing to do with them.

536
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,660
Let's take a step back,

537
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,340
do you think they aren't aware?

538
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,940
They don't live with you

539
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,020
or take care of you,

540
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,180
which means they willingly give up

541
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,820
the inheritance of the house.

542
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,340
Do you think I'm right?

543

(Real Estate Bureau)

544
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,980
Now, you're relieved, huh?

545
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,540
Mom, from this day on,

546
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,980
you're the queen of our family.

547
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,860
Whatever you say will be an order.

548
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,740
You should say, "Aye, Your Majesty."

549
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,740
Aye, Your Majesty.
Let me get you back home.

550

(Real Estate Bureau)

551
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,700
These days,

552
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,500
you've had a hard time.

553
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,180
We're a couple. Don't say that.

554
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,300
Didn't I say?

555
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,980
You don't need to bother

556
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,820
about family business

557
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,900
or the money thing.

558
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,540
Even if you never work,

559
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,580
I'll support you.

560
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,540
When you wanted to set up a fleet,

561
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,060
I tried to stop you.

562
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,700
Now as I think about it,

563
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,940
I was shortsighted.

564
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,100
You did that for my own good.

565
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,900
Different industries are far apart.

566
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,180
What you said to me

567
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,220
really made sense.

568
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,260
Our truck team

569
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,700
is feeling its way around.

570
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,140
We'll develop steadily.

571
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,300
That's good.

572
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,020
Do we have extra money?

573
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,900
What for?

574
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,260
I want to invest in stocks.

575
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,540
Jiahuan,

576
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,500
you can't do that.

577
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,900
Isn't that gambling?

578
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,060
That's different.

579
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,300
Opportunities come with risks.

580
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,980
The point is

581
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,220
this is all I can do.

582
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,460
It's legal.

583
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,660
Are you sure you can earn money?

584
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,660
No.

585
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,660
Then...

586
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,700
But if we can earn some money,

587
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,460
we can start a business.

588
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,940
Jiahuan.

589
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,460
We need money

590
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,980
for a lot of things.

591
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
How about

592
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,060
we do something less risky?

593
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,700
I worked in finance for years.

594
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,100
I have confidence in my expertise.

595
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,380
(SSE A Share)

596
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,220
Jiahuan, lunch is ready.

597
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,180
Jiahuan.

598
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,820
Have lunch. Staring at it
won't change anything.

599
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,740
Check it after lunch.

600
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,940
Or it'll get cold.

601
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,060
Ok. I got it.

602
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,980
In three minutes.

603
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,380
How many times have I told you?

604
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,700
Why is everything green?

605
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,780
We had red hot peppers for a week.

606
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,860
Zhicheng even had a nosebleed.

607
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,740
It hasn't changed anything.

608
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,740
If we keep eating that,
we'll be peppers.

609
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,420
Ok. In three minutes.

610
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,260
Come have lunch.

611
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,340
Mom,

612
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,500
tomorrow is Chinese New Year's eve.

613
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,660
I'm thinking

614
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,140
we'll go to Hongyu's mother's

615
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,460
just as usual.

616
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
You go ahead. I'll stay at home.

617
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,980
Mom, Xiaoling is out.

618
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,780
Jiayi and Jiahuan won't come.

619
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,580
How about you go with us?

620
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,780
Ms. Wang, it's such a nice flat.

621
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,220
I always wanted you to come.

622
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,660
Finally, you're here.

623
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,500
Be seated.

624
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,660
Here, Mom. Have something to eat.

625
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,860
Don't bother.

626
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,860
This flat is really big.

627
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,020
- Very bright.
- Indeed.

628
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,500
Do you know why?

629
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,260
It's on a high floor.

630
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,180
That's right.

631
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,420
I think

632
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
you should also move into a flat.

633
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,460
It's too damp on the first floor.

634
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,300
I'm too old.

635
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,660
I don't think

636
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,500
I can...

637
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,180
Take the stairs.

638
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,500
Then buy a flat with an elevator.

639
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,700
Oh, the new buildings

640
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,740
at Longhu crossing...

641
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,020
There are elevators. Impressive.

642
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,060
Buy a flat there.

643
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,380
Oh, you must protect the recipe

644
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,740
of your pickled vegetables.

645
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,300
The cold dish store
in the south of the market

646
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,760
and Kuai's Beef Soup...

647
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,380
Their recipes

648
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,900
were defrauded.

649
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,060
Really?

650
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,620
Don't lose your recipe.

651
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,620
Is that true?

652
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,060
Yes, of course.

653
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,060
It's on the news.

654
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,260
Luckily, I didn't take your advice

655
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,580
to look for the man
who wanted my recipe.

656
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,300
Mom, I just didn't want you
to miss the opportunity.

657
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,420
I wouldn't miss anything.

658
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,660
If I found him, I'd have lost something.

659
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,940
What if your recipe
is really worth a lot of money?

660
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,900
You even dream of making a fortune.

661
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,380
But in reality, you're poor.

662
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,820
Come on, Mom.

663
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,700
Say something nice
for the Chinese New Year.

664
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
Honestly, those guys

665
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,900
are amateurs.

666
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,700
They're shortsighted.

667
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,460
My recipe

668
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,940
was passed down from your great-grandma.

669
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,020
It's been only inherited by women.

670
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,300
It was made during the reign
of Emperor Daoguang.

671
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,900
Right?

672
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,700
Stop it. I've even memorized it.

673
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,540
Later,

674
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,740
I'll go home.

675
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Hey, Mom. Don't go.

676
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,700
We just had lunch.

677
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,740
We'll have a big dinner.

678
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,020
I won't stay.

679
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,020
People don't have two meals
at someone else's place.

680
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,900
That's inappropriate.

681
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,980
Anyway, I'm tired.

682
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,940
I'll go home and sleep.

683
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,060
But...

684
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,020
Hongyu and I can't get away tonight.

685
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,180
Can you stay alone?

686
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,780
Yes, no problem.

687
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,300
I wonder how Mom
is celebrating this festival.

688
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,900
If you're really worried,

689
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,500
give her a call.

690
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,580
You do it.

691
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
I think you should call her.

692
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,020
Mom isn't home.

693
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,500
It's late.

694
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,740
Where could she be?

695
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,340
Maybe she's out with Xiaoman
setting off firecrackers.

696
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Jiaxi and Hongyu should be indoors.

697
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,430
You call again.

698
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,860
No.

699
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,900
I'm not lucky enough

700
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,300
to die before my husband.

701
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,940
(February, 2006)

702
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,260
(Barbecue Bistro)

703
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,820
How does it taste?

704
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,260
Waitress, the menu, please.

705
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,060
Let me try it.

706
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,260
Xiaonian.

707
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,340
Slicked Hair.

708
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,780
Oh my God.

709
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,180
We haven't seen for years.

710
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,060
Yeah.

711
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,220
Is this your wife?

712
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,670
- Yes.
- Hello.

713
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,660
Ok, then.

714
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,620
It's on me today.

715
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,500
Thanks for helping me in the fight.

716
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,860
You look quite rich.

717
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,260
You must be a big boss.

718
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,860
I wouldn't recognize you
if we met on a street.

719
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm not a boss.

720
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,780
I'm just making a little money

721
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,060
from stocks.

722
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,140
Your fourth aunt
made some from stocks, right?

723
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,940
In the stock hall,

724
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,180
my friends and I saw her.

725
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,020
Really?

726
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,260
We can't earn too much from stocks.

727
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,100
If you have enough money,

728
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,540
buy the futures.

729
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,000
Futures are where
you can make a lot of money.

730
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,180
Come on. Cheers.

731
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,020
Cheers.

732
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,660
See?

733
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,180
I told you that you'd make money, huh?

734
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,940
This is impressive. Incredible.

735
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,020
You know what?

736
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,100
- I had your fortune predicted.
- How is it?

737
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,380
This is your lucky year!

738
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,460
You'll always profit!

739
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,300
Really?

740
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,980
I have techniques and you have luck.

741
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Will you invest more?

742
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,580
Yes! No problem. I'll invest.

743
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,340
If you're short of money, tell me.

744
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,980
I'll lend you some.

745
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,820
Ok.

746
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,420
Join the army?

747
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,940
Xiaonian is temporarily transferred

748
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,100
to the Armed Forces Department.

749
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,060
He isn't in charge.

750
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,660
My mother seldom asks us for help.

751
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,820
He's my second sister's son

752
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,940
and my mother's grandson.

753
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,660
When he asks me for help,

754
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,020
how can we turn him down?

755
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,900
You go ahead, then.

756
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
I won't go.

757
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,140
I can talk to Xiaonian.

758
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,180
It's no problem.

759
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,260
But he shows more respect for you.

760
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,100
You're his aunt.

761
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,700
People are afraid of meeting.

762
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,220
When Xiaonian sees you,

763
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,220
he'll try to help.

764
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,780
How annoying.

765
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,900
(Erzi's Handmade Noodles)

766
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,300
Jiaxi, now,

767
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,660
we have to go
through the normal process.

768
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,420
It depends on the kid's condition.

769
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,940
Don't worry about that.

770
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,780
This kid is qualified in every way.

771
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,860
I have techniques and you have luck.

772
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,860
Will you invest more?

773
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,900
Yes!

774
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,900
To be honest, Aunt Jiaxi.

775
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,580
I'm running a little low on funds.

776
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,820
If you can...

777
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,300
Tell me how much you want.

778
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,820
I'll help you as far as I can.

779
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,770
Twenty thousand?

780
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,500
Twenty thousand?

781
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,780
It's the mate's rate.

782
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,740
Isn't it too much?

783
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,180
Didn't you bargain?

784
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,540
Well, give the money if you want.

785
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,900
Or you can just give up.

786
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,340
No one will force you.

787
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,340
I didn't say we would give up.

788
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,540
I... I'll tell them.

789
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,420
Look how proud you are.

790
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,300
Get a job in another city?

791
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,180
No way. He's too young.

792
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,140
He has to finish high school at least.

793
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,500
You're right.

794
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,620
But he's grown up.

795
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,100
He has his own idea.

796
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,340
We can't control him.

797
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
He's been your burden for years.

798
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,060
Now, Xiaoling is back.

799
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,540
She wants to take care of her son.

800
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,100
How about we send him to her mother?

801
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,700
Jiali,

802
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,860
we can't let him work at this age.

803
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,540
You think I don't know that?

804
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,940
I tried to persuade him many times.

805
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,220
But he just didn't listen.

806
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,340
He can't drop out of school anyway.

807
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,740
You must restrain him.

808
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,900
Aunt,

809
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,500
(Tang Yangyang)
don't blame her.

810
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,900
It's my own decision.

811
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
I really can't study very well.

812
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,340
Instead of wasting time,

813
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,380
I would rather start working early.

814
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,500
The society is also a school.

815
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,540
I can learn there, too.

816
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,220
You know nothing about the society.

817
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,340
When you're out there alone,

818
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,260
you have no diploma

819
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,120
or skills.

820
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,260
How will you make a living?

821
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
I'm young.

822
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,940
That's my advantage. I can learn.

823
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,580
Besides,

824
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,300
Mark promised me

825
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,340
to get me a job in a foreign company.

826
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,380
That's not ok.

827
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,500
Yangyang, can you finish high school?

828
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,460
In the future, if you...

829
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,860
I don't bother about the future.

830
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,730
I can't wait.

831
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,740
I must leave now.

832
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,220
Anyway, I've grown up.

833
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,940
I can choose my own future.

834
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,100
You're still under 18

835
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
and you aren't an adult.

836
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,620
He just has his mother's temper.

837
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,580
When he's stubborn,

838
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,140
nothing can change his mind.

839
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,300
Yangyang.

840
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,340
I support you to go to Shanghai.

841
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,420
It's melting.

842
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,140
Eat it quickly.

843
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,100
(Huainan Beef Soup)

844
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,060
Mom has been there.

845
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,380
I totally understand you.

846
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,260
The world is so big.

847
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,660
When I was young, I also dreamed

848
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,580
to go out and challenge.

849
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,340
At that time, I thought life

850
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,540
had a lot of possibilities.

851
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,540
You're my son.

852
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,700
I understand you.

853
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,980
Besides,

854
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,540
it's your own life.

855
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,300
You have the right to choose your way.

856
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,740
But remember one thing.

857
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,820
If one day you can't survive out there,

858
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,140
come back.

859
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,940
This is your home.

860
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,020
It won't happen.

861
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,980
I think I'll be successful.

862
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,900
I think so, too.

863
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,180
Yangyang.

864
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,420
Mom always wanted

865
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,820
to tell you something.

866
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,660
But...

867
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,340
I was too ashamed to say that.

868
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,620
I know you hate me.

869
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,020
All these years,

870
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,620
my recklessness and impulsion

871
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,060
have caused you

872
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,940
so much trouble and pain.

873
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,740
My apologies.

874
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,820
I don't hate you.

875
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
I did before.

876
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,700
But now, I don't.

877
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,220
Don't try to comfort me.

878
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm serious.

879
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,700
You've never been
a mother before, after all.

880
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
People say

881
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,020
one can't

882
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,220
choose his family.

883
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,940
But he can choose

884
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,700
what kind of life he'll live.

885
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,340
Anyway,

886
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,540
I take you,

887
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,140
Liu Xiaoling,

888
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,580
as a good friend

889
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,820
of mind.

890
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,100
Good friend?

891
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,740
That's good.

892
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,620
Good friend.

893
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
Right.

894
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,700
Then, I'm your friend.

895
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,860
A friend

896
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,300
who always give you
unconditional support.

897
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,900
We should have a drink today.

898
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,180
Sir, two bottles of beer.

899
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,500
We don't have that.

900
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,220
- What about soda?
- Yes.

901
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,860
Two big bottles, please.

902
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,060
I'm not an adult yet.

903
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,300
Don't make me drink wine.

904
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,700
I'll go get the soda.

905
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,940
Xiaonian.

906
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,620
He Xiangdong.

907
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,300
Xiangdong. Open the door, Xiangdong.

908
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,940
He Xiangdong.

909
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,180
What's going on?

910
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,540
Who's that? Open the door.

911
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,500
Don't open it.

912
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,340
What...

913
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
What's going on?

914
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,340
It's Slicked Hair. I...

915
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,980
He Xiangdong.

916
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,100
I'm in debt.

917
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,340
What?

918
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,860
You're in debt?

919
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,780
You made money from futures, didn't you?

920
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,740
How much do you owe him?

921
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,580
He Xiangdong,

922
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,780
I know you're home.

923
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,540
You think you can
repudiate your debt like this?

924
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,740
You wish.

925
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,300
You have three days.

926
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,380
Collect the money and give it to me.

927
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,940
Or I'll go where you work.

928
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,500
I have plenty of ways to deal with you.

929
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,780
I should go.

930
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,340
I won't disrupt your life.

931
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,020
Mom, I'm scared.

932
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,820
It's ok. Don't be scared.

933
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,300
He Xiangdong, how much do you owe him?
