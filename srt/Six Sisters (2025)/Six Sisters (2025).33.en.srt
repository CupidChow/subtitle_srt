=Episode 33=

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Hey, Xiaoling.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
Don't touch anything.

17
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,560
The equipment is very expensive.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,590
If you break it, in no way can we pay.

19
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,840
Fine, fine.

20
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,510
This is the employee manual.

21
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,510
It offers the workflow and guidelines.

22
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,350
- Read it carefully.
- Ok.

23
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,430
Later, someone will guide you.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,310
Alright.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
Don't worry.

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,510
Sharp eyes are my best advantage.

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,510
Sharp eyes aren't enough.

28
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,230
You must be patient and careful.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,150
Oh, the internship period is six months.

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,800
You must pass the qualification exam

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,040
before you're officially hired.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
Then...

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,440
Is there a salary for the internship?

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,880
No, according to the rules.

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,150
But Hongyu's brother
knows the boss very well.

36
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,230
He got you a salary.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,390
Enough for meals, anyway.

38
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,430
Jiaxi, you're such a good sister.

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,360
Of course.

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,230
Xiaoling,

41
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,750
your job

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,150
is almost settled down.

43
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,830
Move out of Mom's home, then.

44
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,560
Don't worry.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,880
I've found somewhere to live.

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,200
- Where is it?
- It's not far.

47
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,120
Near Jiawen's home.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,200
A small bungalow.

49
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,590
That's good.

50
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,430
Work hard.

51
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,710
- Ok.
- Let's move on.

52
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,550
Sure.

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,950
Xiaoling.

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,790
- We're here.
- Welcome,

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
sisters.

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,830
This room looks good. Is the rent high?

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,840
No. It's a cheap house.
I just pay a little

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,230
and I'll take care of the house.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,040
Oh, there's another room.

60
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
It's enough for you alone.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,840
Yeah. It looks very big.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,710
Right.

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,560
It just doesn't have a toilet.

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,710
I need to go out.

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,720
Just like when we lived in the north.

66
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,620
Right.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,200
My life is getting even worse.

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,150
This one-family house is awesome.

69
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,040
It's quiet.

70
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,400
Well, you guys talk.

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,240
I go to the toilet.

72
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,800
Ok. Turn right and go down the street.

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,640
I know.

74
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,630
Sit, Jiali. Sit down.

75
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,280
I don't want to stain your bed.

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you despise this house?

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,760
That's not true.

78
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,510
Be seated.

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Look at me.

80
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,990
I've got a job.

81
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,110
I have somewhere to live, too.

82
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,790
I can even profit
from the rent difference.

83
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,510
Yes. Your life is back on track.

84
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,040
But Yangyang...

85
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,850
Can you think of a way for me?

86
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,910
When I saw two rooms
and two beds here,

87
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,940
I knew you wanted to get Yangyang here.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,510
This place, you know,

89
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,600
is near his school.

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,910
It's convenient for him.

91
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,390
You're always careless.

92
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,190
Now, you can use your brain.

93
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,910
I can always use my brain.

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,510
Oh, poor mother.

95
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,030
Thanks.

96
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,150
Alright. Go check it.

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,760
Ok, Jiayi.

98
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,840
Please enter the password.

99
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
(Checking)

100
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,620
(Balance: 104,000 yuan
Available: 104,000 yuan)

101
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,350
The money is in.

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,630
Jiayi, good luck with your business.

103
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,760
From your lips to God's ears.

104
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,430
Now, we're even.

105
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,560
Yes, indeed.

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,150
Where will you move?

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,030
What? Will you offer a flat?

108
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,150
I live and eat in the hotel.

109
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,310
I even plan
to spend my last years there.

110
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,800
I have no flats.

111
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,120
Here. Take a look.

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,510
Don't touch the card
after touching my feet.

113
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,390
That's jinxed.

114
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,750
I love to see the number.

115
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,760
Let me see it. Hurry.

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,910
Come on. You'll see it like this.

117
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,190
When you have time these days,

118
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,480
tidy up our home.

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,950
Move big things to Xiaoling's house.

120
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,160
We'll take away the small ones.

121
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,200
Where are we moving, then?

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
Yan Hongyu, what's wrong with you?

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
To my mom's house.

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,710
Didn't we have a deal?

125
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,350
What if Jiali is upset?

126
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,760
Don't be scared.

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,440
Problems must be solved.

128
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,830
Sooner or later.

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,240
Jiali,

130
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,950
doing laundry, huh?

131
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,640
I have something to tell you.

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
You go inside.

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,240
I'll finish the laundry first.

134
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,390
It's ok. I can talk here.

135
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,750
Xiaoman's household registration
is transferred here.

136
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,920
She'll enroll soon.

137
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,880
In autumn, she'll go to primary school.

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,600
Her grandma said

139
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,910
she could live there.

140
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,430
But I think that's far and inconvenient.

141
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll be worried
if her grandma looks after her.

142
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,200
So, maybe,

143
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,270
we have to move back here.

144
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,590
Ok.

145
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,440
Jiali, to be honest,

146
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,030
I don't just move back for Xiaoman.

147
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
I also want

148
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,640
to share your burden.

149
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,800
You took care of Grandma
in her last years.

150
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,880
You'll take care of Mom, too.

151
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Sisters like us

152
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,560
all think you work too hard.

153
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,390
You've been taking care of this family.

154
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,740
You deserve some rest.

155
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,510
Besides, you should also

156
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,830
take care of Xiaonian's child.

157
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,830
You can't ignore your grandchild.

158
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,350
There's no hurry, Jiali.

159
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,640
We'll move before school begins.

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,070
Think about it.

161
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,080
Xiaonian lived here
when he went to school.

162
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,870
Now, Xiaoman will go to school.

163
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,880
How time flies.

164
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,450
This house is quite prosperous.

165
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
Just now, Jiaxi came,

166
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
officially informing us

167
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,040
Xiaoman would go to school in autumn

168
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,170
and they would move back.

169
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,320
She wanted us to get out now.

170
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,710
Did she really say that?

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,620
You must be exaggerating.

172
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
That's what she actually means.

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Xiaoman will go to school.

174
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,830
That's exactly why

175
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,890
her registration is back here.

176
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,030
I'm not surprised.

177
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,590
The two of us

178
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,320
will live somewhere else.

179
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,470
Don't fall out with them.

180
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,600
When Xiaoling was back,

181
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Jiaxi was really busy.

182
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,710
She offered a lot of ideas.

183
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,680
See? She moved Xiaoling out.

184
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
Now, she's kicking us out.

185
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,440
Don't say that.

186
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,110
Jiaxi's request is reasonable.

187
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,630
When she wants
to take care of Mom, let her be.

188
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,830
That's a good thing.

189
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,840
Mom must have pampered her.

190
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,750
Without permission,

191
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,630
she wouldn't dare.

192
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,150
Mom has a big problem with us.

193
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,830
So, we need an early plan.

194
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,870
What plan?

195
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,800
Rent a flat.

196
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
How about

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,230
we buy a flat?

198
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,590
Shall we live with Xiaonian?

199
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,470
Don't make more trouble.

200
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,910
Distance makes heart grow fonder.

201
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,960
When they got married,

202
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,000
we didn't live with them.

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,550
Our son and his wife

204
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,680
will just be relatives

205
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
who we sometimes visit.

206
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,520
We will

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,710
buy a small flat.

208
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,920
We'll stay there until we die.

209
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,920
We won't move out of there.

210
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,920
That's good.

211
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,590
But do you have money?

212
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,710
We'll think of a way.

213
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,150
What way?

214
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,230
Can you do magic?

215
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,080
I'll get the money.

you must have had poor meals lately.

258
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,740
Try if they taste as good as before.

259
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,420
Dad, the wine.

260
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,060
Oh, yes.

261
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
Here it is.

262
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,220

271
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,000
But I'm innocent.

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,100
Of course, you are.

273
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm not innocent
because he killed himself.

274
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,980
I'm just innocent.

275
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
I'm not involved in this.

276
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
I didn't know what he did.

277
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,940
I really didn't know.

278
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,020
- I'm innocent.
- I know.

279
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,900
I know.

280
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,220

It's not too late to leave me now.

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,820
Don't be ridiculous.

284
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,380
I have nothing now.

285
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,540
And I'm nobody.

286
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,420
It doesn't matter.

287
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,220
I can't get my old job back.

288
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,740
I can't go back to work.

289
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,180
My previous efforts are wasted.

290
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,940
Everything's in vain. I can't go back.

291
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,780
I've lost everything.

292
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,380
- I'm not what I used to be.
- Jiahuan.

293
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,260
Jiahuan, I said it's ok.

294
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,620
I was laid off, too.

295
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,300
Jiayi and Ouyang rose again, right?

296
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,460
As long as we're alive,

297
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,860
we can start all over again.

298
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,860

to be abandoned by destiny.

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,340

So is my pride.

302
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,460
I've lost everything.

303
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,740

Jiahuan, how did it feel
when you were in there?

376
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,020
Xiaoling, have some pork.

377
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,420
It's really tasty.

378
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
Ok.

379
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Xiaoling, you can get in there

380
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,500
and experience that.

381
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,580
I don't dare.

382
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,140
- Jiahuan.
- Eat.

383
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,420
Later, get remarried to Fang Tao.

384
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,220
What do you mean?

385
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,860
Why will you get remarried?

386
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,220
Did you divorce?

387
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,000
I missed a lot of exciting stories.

388
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,720
Xiaoling, have some shrimp.

389
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,730
Here.

390
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,660
We know you have a tongue.

391
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,380
How's your job?

392
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,340
I quit.

393
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,180
- Have some shrimp.
- No worries.

394
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,180
Adjust your mood first.

395
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,860
Then, we'll see.

396
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,700
Get her a shrimp.

397
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,940
- Where's Guangming?
- She doesn't want it.

398
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,140
- Guangming.
- He...

399
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,700
He'll have the exam.

400
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,940
So, I didn't invite him.

401
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,860
He'll come next time.

402
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
That's right.

403
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,660
I guess only Guangming
will be successful.

404
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,220
That depends.

405
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,580
All roads lead to Rome.

406
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,100
Which school is Feng in?

407
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,180
I'm in a vocational college.

408
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,620
That's right.

409
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,620
That's good.

410
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,780
We're satisfied.

411
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,260
Let me say something.

412
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,140
Jianguo and I

413
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,220
will move out, too.

414
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,900
Why?

415
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,260
Mom,

416
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,580
what's going on?

417
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,340
Xiaoman is going to primary school.

418
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,100
Jiaxi will move back in.

419
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,420
Yeah. Xiaoman's grandma is competitive.

420
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,220
Xiaoman has to go to HNU Primary School.

421
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,580
It makes sense.

422
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,500
A child

423
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,380
should have a head start.

424
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,380
When Mom is still strong enough,

425
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,100
she can help take care of Xiaoman.

426
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,260
She doesn't need to.

427
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,100
I'll take care of Xiaoman myself.

428
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,220
I'm not moving back to bother Mom.

429
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,060
Besides, I can also take care of Mom.

430
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,940
Hongyu said

431
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,700
we had a responsibility
to take care of Mom.

432
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
That's right.

433
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,620
Mom, where will you and Dad live?

434
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,620
How about you live with us?

435
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,500
Mom, our home is the stronghold for you.

436
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,100
Welcome back anytime.

437
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,420
Come on.

438
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,780
Have another drink. Cheers.

439
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,660
- Cheers.
- You guys drink.

440
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,020
Let's drink. Come on, Tao.

441
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,860
Cheers.

442
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,980
Who is she to make you move out?

443
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,300
She knows you have nowhere to live now.

444
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,860
She must be on purpose.

445
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,700
I understand.

446
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,020
Nonsense.

447
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,460
Xiaoman was registered here
a long time ago.

448
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,020
It can't be a sudden plan.

449
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,740
Just a matter of time.

450
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,820
Can't you restrain her as you did

451
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,660
in our childhood?

452
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,740
Why aren't you as tough as before?

453
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,860
You've grown up.

454
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,580
You're even mothers.

455
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,640
I can't restrain you
like I did in childhood?

456
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,140
The problem is she can easily move in

457
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,700
but won't easily move out.

458
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,820
I don't expect her to move out.

459
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,180
I just want her
to take good care of Mom.

460
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,900
Is she actually a caring woman?

461
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,220
Mom brought Jiaxi up. They're close.

462
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,980
If she takes care of Mom
when Mom's old,

463
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,180
that's ok.

464
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,020
We should give Mom some money

465
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,900
in case people gossip.

466
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,160
But you need somewhere to live.

467
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,380
My husband wants

468
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,780
to buy a small flat.

469
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,820
A pre-owned one.

470
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,620
We'll see. We can rent one first.

471
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,420
It's ok.

472
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,420
Jiali didn't say anything.

473
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,100
What would she say?

474
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,940
What could she say?

475
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,780
Her silence was worse than complaint!

476
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,980
She said she'd move out
in front of the whole family.

477
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,180
Why? So, everybody has to take a side.

478
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,060
Listen, Yan Hongyu.

479
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,940
Let's bet. Believe it or not,
this isn't over.

480
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,540
Maybe we can't move back there.

481
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,640
It won't happen.

482
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,680
It won't?

483
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,850
She won't make a scene.

484
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,290
But she'll make someone else do that.

485
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,890
Didn't you see?
Jiawen pulled a long face immediately.

486
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,290
Jiayi looked upset, too.

487
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,210
Jiahuan looked alright.

488
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,010
Maybe she is still confused out of jail.

489
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,890
Think about Xiaoling.
She wants something, too.

490
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,690
You think others don't want benefits?

491
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,170
Maybe they think we'll move back there

492
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,490
for Mom's house

493
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,770
and her pension.

494
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,530
We really want her house, don't we?

495
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,450
No!

496
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,350
I do this for Xiaoman's education.

497
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,470
Fine.

498
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,530
Let's not talk about this.

499
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,810
Since Jiali brought it up,

500
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,250
it's now on the calendar.

501
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,650
Jiali is in the wrong industry.

502
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,050
She should have been an actress.

503
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,490
Maybe she'd be the Best Actress.

504
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,690
Think about her big eyes.

505
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,050
When she stares with tears,

506
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,370
everybody will pity her.

507
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,970
But it makes sense.

508
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,650
I'm sure she thinks

509
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,610
she's sacrificed a lot for this family.

510
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,040
But she didn't expect

511
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,000
she and Mom
couldn't get along very well.

512
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,040
Mom didn't ask her to stay.

513
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,160
Alright.

514
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Say no more.

515
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,280
Stop thinking. Don't go crazy.

516
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,760
Or you'll be too angry to sleep.

517
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,480
Stop thinking. Come on.

518
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,720
(Tianjia'an Civil Affairs Bureau
July 19, 2002)

519
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,680
Come on. Smile.

520
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,760
Ma'am, smile.

521
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,720
Ok.

(Marriage Registration)

523
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,220
I'm qualified to cook for you again.

524
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,500
I can only offer steamed buns and rice.

525
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,100
You don't want steak?

526
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,620
Then, I want sweet bean sauce on it.

527

(Admission Ticket)

529
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
My heart is racing.

530
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,260
Come on. My heart races, too.

531
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,900
You're admitted
to Jiangnan Forestry University.

532
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,380
Jiangnan Forestry University?

533
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,250
Did he apply for that?

534
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,100
Yes.

535
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,780
Ok.

536
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,700
Where is this university?

537
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,700
At the foot of the Purple Mountain
in suburban Nanjing.

538
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,260
So,

539
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,820
it's not far from Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

540
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,340
It's a good place.

541
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,220
Yes. Good, indeed.

542
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,740
The air must be good.

543
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,500
Well done, son.

544
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,320
You're going to college.

545
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,660
Very good.

546
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,020
Jiaxi,

547
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,780
you should move out soon.

548
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,980
I'm waiting to renovate this house.

549
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,060
When it's cold,
the smell won't dissipate.

550
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,620
I'm more anxious than you.

551
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,300
Fine. Glad you know what to do.

552
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,460
I should go.

553
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,660
Jiayi, have an ice pop.

554
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,980
No.

555
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,940
I'm too old to eat icy food.

556
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,380
Stop cooling yourself.
Here. Have an ice pop.

557
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,500
Yan Hongyu, are you insane?

558
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,980
Do you think an ice pop will work?

559
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,340
I won't eat it.

560
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,900
It's so hot.

561
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,220
The fan doesn't even work.

562
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,860
I need the air-conditioner.

563
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,380
Don't be ridiculous.

564
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,620
We're moving away soon.

565
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,900
Soon?

566
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,220
You know what?

567
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,220
We'll have to wait.

568
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,780
I gave Jiali a hint today.

569
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,460
But she didn't seem to take that.

570
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,460
No way. She agreed last time.

571
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,300
Don't you know
she's a tough nut to crack?

572
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,020
If she doesn't move out, what can we do?

573
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,780
When tenants refuse to move out,

574
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,500
what can the landlord do?

575
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,300
Jiali and Jianguo
aren't that kind of person.

576
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,940
How long have you known them?

577
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,780
I've been getting along with them.

578
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,750
Mom, you should remind Jiali.

579
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,790
You know what?

580
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,390
Jiali is wicked.

581
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,270
Unless you make everything clear,

582
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,230
she'll always play dumb.

583
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,150
(Pickled Vegetables)
I gave her one year.

584
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,310
Do you know what I suffered this year?

585
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,350
It's so hard to send
and get back Xiaoman.

586
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,670
I can't do anything, you know.

587
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,630
Mom,

588
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,750
now I have to...

589
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,590
I really have to move in.

590
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,510
Look what a mess she has made

591
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,710
in your house.

592
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,190
When I move in, I'll tidy it up.

593
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,070
That day,

594
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,550
I looked in the kitchen.

595
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,670
The oil on the exhaust hood
can be this thick.

596
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,790
It's nearly dropping.

597
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,790
If it drops into the pot,

598
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,270
how can you eat the dishes?

599
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,750
I can't even imagine

600
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,990
how many cockroaches
there are under the stove.

601
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,990
That's true.

602
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,870
Jiali is really tolerant.

603
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,030
The kitchen is really...

604
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,510
If you knew it, why didn't you tell her?

605
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,390
You're tolerant, too.

606
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,510
Anyway, tonight, you will

607
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,390
tell her to move out.

608
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,630
I...

609
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,950
I can't force her.

610
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,350
You won't force her, Mom.

611
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,390
You just won't.

612
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,510
You'll remind her.

613
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,710
Besides,

614
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,750
she said she would move out.

615
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,630
A promise is a promise.

616
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,390
She can't regret it, anyway.

617
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,710
Let's wait.

618
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,430
Fine.

619
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,470
Anyway, if you don't talk to her,

620
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,630
I'll communicate.

621
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,390
Once I start my plan,

622
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,950
I won't just talk.

623
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,390
What?

624
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,390
Will you force them to move out?

625
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,190
People deserve different treatments.

626
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,430
I have to do something harsh

627
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,590
to someone as shameless as her.

628
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,230
It's dark. Stop reading.

629
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,550
Or turn on the light.

630
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,070
No need. I can read like this.

631
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,790
It's cloudy.

632
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,950
It's going to rain.

633
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,270
Get the clothes back.

634
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,910
It won't rain, says the weather report.

635
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,990
The weather changes fast.

636
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,310
The forecast isn't reliable.

637
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,470
Fine. I get it.

638
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,670
- Jiaxi.
- Jianguo.

639
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,270
The kitchen is there.

640
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,110
- Smash.
- They...

641
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,150
Yes, boss.

642
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,310
What are you doing?

643
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,230
Jiaxi, what’s going on?

644
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,190
Did you get these guys here?

645
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,470
Jiali,

646
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,310
Mom wants to have the kitchen renovated.

647
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,790
So, I got some guys here.

648
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,510
What on earth are you doing?

649
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,790
We take orders from the boss.

650
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,870
Go talk to her.

651
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,950
We still live here.

652
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,310
Don't touch anything.

653
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,070
I told you to move out.

654
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,270
Several times.

655
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,820
The kitchen is too old.

656
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,270
Time for a renovation. Smash!

657
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,590
- Ok.
- Ok.

658
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,470
Nobody move.

659
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,390
I said, nobody move.

660
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,550
- Guys, smash.
- Nobody move.

661
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,070
- Stay out!
- I'll call the police!

662
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,970
You may get hurt.

663
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,830
Get out of here.

664
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,230
Jianguo, be careful. Jianguo.

665
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,110
Jianguo, don't get hurt.

666
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,470
What's going on here?

667
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,310
Did you send these guys?

668
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,150
None of our business.

669
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,070
I...

670
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,990
I didn't.

671
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,910
You go out.

672
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,310
Be gentle, guys.

673
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,380
Mom,

674
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,540
sit down here.

675
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,020
Sit.

676
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,940
Jiali,

677
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,700
don't push it.

678
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,900
This is Mom's home.

679
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,940
It's her house.

680
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,340
She can do anything she wants.

681
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,100
She can live with anyone she likes.

682
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,740
You aren't in charge alone.

683
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,260
You know what?

684
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,260
All these years,

685
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,380
Mom has lived a hard life!

686
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,860
This kind of life has to be over!

687
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,700
Enough!

688
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,060
- Mom!
- Mom.

689
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,180
Is this your idea?

690
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,700
- No. Umm...
- Don't press Mom!

691
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,020
Mom!

692
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,060
Let's go.

693
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,100
Jianguo, Jia... Jiali.

694
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,660
- Mom.
- What's going on?

695
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
- Go inside.
- Why?

696
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,500
It's dangerous here.

697
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,660
Listen to me and go inside.

698
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,860
Go!

699
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,860
What the heck.

700
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,500
What's going on here?

701
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,540
Stop, all of you!

702
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
Liu Xiaoling, none of your business.

703
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,500
Stay out of this!

704
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,260
Mom.

705
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,500
Hope you won't regret it.

706
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,780
What happened, He Jiaxi?

707
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,780
He Jiaxi, are you insane?

708
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,340
Jiaxi, you...

709
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,980
You're going too far.

710
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,140
Mom,

711
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,140
I did all this for you.

712
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,900
Now, they're gone.

713
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,780
You won't be annoyed anymore.

714
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,860
Don't weaken.

715
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,860
Why did we leave?

716
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,500
We shouldn't have left like that.

717
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,700
Jiaxi dared to have the kitchen smashed.

718
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,300
Mom possibly approved it.

719
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,780
We should have left earlier.

720
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,340
That's why things are awful.

721
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,460
No way. I must go back.

722
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Forget it. We're a family.

723
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,100
Don't make it worse.

724
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,980
What kind of family is that?

725
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,660
I can't let it go.

726
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,780
So,

727
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,700
we can't count on anyone else.

728
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
That's not anyone else.

729
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,860
That's my family.

730
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,060
And I promised to move out.

731
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,580
Why couldn't they wait?

732
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,820
Let it go, Jiali.

733
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,300
We have to rely on ourselves.

734
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,380
On ourselves?

735
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,740
Jiaxi doesn't even care for her sister.

736
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,780
Why didn't she rely
on herself 20 years ago?

737
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,460
Now, we're old and we're a burden.

738
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,980
So, we're useless.

739
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,380
Don't think like that.

740
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,260
Anyway,

741
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,260
you still have me.

742
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,660
- Let's not compete.
- Did I?

743
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,180
You saw that.

744
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,220
Mom listened to Jiaxi

745
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
and let her do anything.

746
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,700
Does Jiaxi show any respect for me?

747
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,620
For this family,

748
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,460
the elders and kids,

749
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,580
I've done so much.

750
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,620
In the end, they don't even respect me.

751
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,220
They even smash things.

752
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,180
Come on. Don't be angry.

753
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,220
I can't accept this.

754
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,500
I really can't.

755
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,060
Fine. I know you feel bad.

756
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,140
Come on, calm down.

757
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,780
Moving out?

758
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,620
Jiayi.

759
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,620
- Jiaxi.
- Here.

760
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,500
Are you moving out?

761
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,300
Or what? Staying forever?

762
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,460
Don't be so angry.

763
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,700
Where will you move?

764
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,260
Home.

765
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,940
Good for you.

766
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,860
What about Jiali? Moved out?

767
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,660
I'm not sure.

768
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,220
Anyway, Mom told me

769
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,180
to move back.

770
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,580
You've finally got permission.

771
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,180
(Huaishun Hotel)

772
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,470
The moment I entered the yard,

773
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,530
I saw Jiaxi

774
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,150
break in with some strong guys.

775
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,730
They swung the hammers

776
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,370
and smashed the kitchen.

777
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,910
Don't worry, Jiali.

778
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,080
I will

779
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,110
definitely avenge you.

780
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,250
I'll pack up and move in.

781
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,310
I'll give her a hard time. I...

782
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,660
No need. Don't make things worse.

783
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,300
Just go to work.

784
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,380
Don't say anything
if you see Jiaxi at work.

785
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,620
Fine. I should go.

786
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,820
I'm getting late. Bye, Jiali.

787
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,020
In my opinion,

788
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,340
Mom is to blame.

789
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,860
Without her support,

790
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,700
Jiaxi wouldn't dare.

791
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,140
When the mother is partial,

792
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,460
the whole family can't be harmonious.

793
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,260
Jiaxi is so terrible.

794
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,060
Without your help,

795
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,220
she wouldn't have come this far.

796
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,740
Yesterday, I couldn't let it go.

797
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,020
But today, I can.

798
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,660
I won't talk about contributions.

799
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,140
I have to admit I'm old.

800
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,260
Jiaxi never cares

801
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,580
for someone so useless.

802
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,220
That's normal.

803
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,820
I'm totally fine
when Mom lives with her.

804
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,140
Jiali,

805
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,660
don't worry.

806
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,460
Whatever happens,

807
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,900
I'll be on your side.

808
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,900
Jiali just moved out?

809
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,420
It's so heartless of you.

810
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,140
I really can't live very well

811
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,740
with Jiali and her husband.

812
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,180
We don't like the same dishes

813
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,660
and we have no common topics.

814
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,780
You have no idea.

815
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,380
Jiali can't get along with me.

816
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,060
She loves to talk back.

817
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,220
You shouldn't have
kicked her out anyway.

818
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,420
She contributed too much to your family.

819
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,260
Think about it.

820
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,140
Since your husband died,

821
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
without Jiali,

822
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,660
- her sisters would...
- I didn't

823
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,780
kick her out.

824
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,380
She moved out herself.

825
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,420
I failed to stop her.

826
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,020
Besides, she doesn't care for me.

827
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,580
Her grandma brought her up.

828
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,540
She's never close to me.

829
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,580
It's good to live separately.

830
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,060
Jiali is such a good daughter.

831
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,820
Come on. When she lived with me,

832
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,900
we both felt terrible.

833
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,940
Now, it's good. We won't be annoyed.

834
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,980
I'll put them by the door.

835
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,140
- Jiali is so good.
- Oh no.

836
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,660
- Put them down.
- I'll put them here.

837
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,500
Ok.

838
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,020
There you are.

839
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,860
You're here, Ms. Liu.

840
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,460
Greetings, Ms. Liu.

841
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,020
So, you're moving back?

842
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,620
Yes, I'm moving back.

843
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,020
My mother asked me to move back.

844
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,980
She can live with anyone she wants.

845
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,900
- It's convenient for Xiaoman.
- Yeah.

846
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,380
Ms. Liu, come visit us often.

847
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,420
Ok.

848
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,820
I'm going to Shanghai soon.

849
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,020
You're so blessed.

850
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,620
I should go.

851
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,580
Already?

852
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,460
- Fine.
- Be nice to your mom.

853
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,460
Take good care of her.

854
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,580
Don't worry. She will.

855
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,420
Rest assured.

856
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,260
- Leaving?
- Yes.

857
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,380
Be careful.

858
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,300
- See you, Ms. Liu.
- We'll talk later.

859
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,900
This old woman

860
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,540
always gossips in someone else's home.

861
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,860
- Not at all.
- She gossips about everyone.

862
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,780
Glad you're going to Shanghai!

863
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,420
In this case, neighbors will be quiet.

864
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,020
Shh. She hasn't gone very far.

865
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,220
Why are you being too harsh?

866
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,860
Am I being harsh? I don't think so.

867
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,340
Luck keeps changing.

868
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,620
Time for my luck to change.

869
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,300
Jiali can live here. So can I.

870
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,060
Mom,

871
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,140
what do you like to eat?

872
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,020
Hongyu will go buy it.

873
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,780
We'll celebrate.

874
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,140
Jiali, Jianguo.

875
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,900
What do you think?

876
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,020
I think it's a good flat.

877
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,180
It's cheap, you know.

878
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
The furniture is ready.

879
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,820
- Live here for now.
- Another room?

880
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,140
Yes. A bedroom in there.

881
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,140
Good. Good place.

882
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,700
Thank you, Xiaoling.

883
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,100
Jiali,

884
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,700
I'll always be on your side,
whatever happens.

885
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,300
Jiaxi is awful.

886
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,540
Forget it.

887
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,860
What's gone is gone.

888
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,380
Fine. You get some rest.

889
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,260
I should go.

890
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,100
Here's the key.

891
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,340
- Ok.
- Bye.

892
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,100
Bye, Jianguo.

893
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,180
Take this.

894
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,300
Is this your secret money?

895
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,380
Kind of.

896
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,900
(Certificate of Deposit)

897
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,380
Hey, Zhang Jianguo. How dare you?

898
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,300
You saved money under my nose.

899
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,140
I...

900
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,220
When Xiaonian got married,

901
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,980
I realized we needed a backup plan.

902
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,540
When we are old,

903
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,340
if we fall sick or something,

904
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,540
the money will help.

905
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,020
Now, it will help.

906
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,980
Look around.

907
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,060
We need a home, after all.

908
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,540
Is there more?

909
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,140
No.

910
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,700
No, indeed.
