00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,130
After a while, you'll be the only one

16
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,820
left in this house.

17
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,860
Mom!

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,850
What are we having for dinner?

19
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,420
Noodles.

20
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,460
Wouldn't it be better

21
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,930
with a little Eight Pickled Vegetables?

22
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,610
You made it before.

23
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,210
Eight Pickled Vegetables?

24
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,650
I'll make some if you want.

25
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,610
You shouldn't

26
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,770
lose this skill.

27
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,090
Your mom passed it down to you.

28
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,900
It's just a small trick.

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,090
Nobody would be interested in it.

30
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Don't say that.

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,100
In the South,

32
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,740
we do big business with small things,

33
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,540
like wheat gluten from Wuxi

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,300
and vinegar from Zhenjiang.

35
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,620
They are not small at all.

36
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,020
They've been passed on to thousands.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,420
You must be kidding.

38
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,140
Why don't you

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,820
make some pickles to sell at the market?

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,620
It helps you to pass the time.

41
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,220
You're retired, right?

42
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,060
Sell pickles?

43
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,310
We are taking inventory today.

44
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,060
Come tomorrow.

45
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,660
Qiufang?

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,020
Weimin thinks

47
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,460
that marriage is not a trifling matter

48
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,180
and should be considered carefully.

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,580
To be honest,

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,980
Xiaoling and Zhenmin

51
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,540
are like children.

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,780
If they actually get married,

53
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,820
they'll definitely

54
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,020
kick up a storm.

55
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,780
We're on the same page.

56
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,220
We don't agree either.

57
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,380
What does Xiaoling think?

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,580
She's moved out.

59
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,180
Zhenmin has moved out too.

60
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,380
Where did he move to?

61
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,420
Yaojiawan.

62
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,900
No! They've moved in together!

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,740
- What should we do?
- Hurry!

64
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
Be careful. Don't get burned.

65
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,260
Where do I put it?

66
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,220
In the basin.

67
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,380
And then?

68
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,380
Lie down.

69
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,020
Why?

70
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,260
Play dead.

71
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,980
Play dead, for who?

72
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,580
My big sister.

73
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,580
Is your sister coming?

74
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,020
From what I know of her,

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,340
she's definitely coming.

76
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,460
- Then I'm leaving.
- Come back!

77
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,580
If she comes

78
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,140
and sees us in the same room,

79
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,260
won't it give her the wrong idea?

80
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,300
I want her to get the wrong idea.

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,100
Tang Zhenmin, do you want to marry me?

82
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Yes.

83
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,060
Do what I tell you. Lie down.

84
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,180
Can you play dead?

85
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,300
I've never died before.

86
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,180
I don't know how.

87
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,350
Just lie down and close your eyes.

88
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,580
Don't answer no matter who calls you.

89
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,420
Lie down.

90
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,780
Eyes closed and no answer.

91
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,140
Tang Zhenmin.

92
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,540
Didn't I tell you not to answer?

93
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,460
Does it start already?

94
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,700
They are coming.

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,300
Zhenmin, hold your breath.

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,400
Don't get up no matter who calls you.

97
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,260
Good job.

98
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,380
Liu Xiaoling.

99
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,180
Tang Zhenmin.

100
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
Liu Xiaoling.

101
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,220
The smell of a coal stove.

102
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,500
- Xiaoling.
- Zhenmin.

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,620
Liu Xiaoling.

104
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,660
Liu Xiaoling!

105
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,900
These guys...

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,660
Liu Xiaoling! Liu Xiaoling!

107
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
Tang Zhenmin!

108
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,620
I got this.

109
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,100
Jiali?

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
Qiufang?

111
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,580
Am I dead?

112
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,980
Zhenmin.

113
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,880
Zhenmin, we agreed to die together!

114
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,210
Don't leave me alone!

115
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,220
Tang Zhenmin!

116
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,500
- Zhenmin!
- Tang Zhenmin!

117
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
You can wake up now!

118
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,900
Tang Zhenmin!

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,340
Tang Zhenmin!

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,620
- You can wake up.
- It's ok.

121
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,780
Tang Zhenmin.

122
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,420
Tang Zhenmin.

123
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,700
Wake up.

124
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,780
Tang Zhenmin.

125
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,980
Zhenmin!

126
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,420
Tang Zhenmin.

127
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,660
You scared me to death.

128
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,940
I thought you were really dead.

129
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,700
You think you're Romeo and Juliet?

130
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,180
What?

131
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,220
Nothing.

132
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,420
Jiali,

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,980
Qiufang,

134
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,180
I'll go wherever Liu Xiaoling goes

135
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,460
in this life.

136
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,900
Fine.

137
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,700
You both go to hell.

138
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,420
Get back home tonight.

139
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,900
I think it worked.

140
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,500
I was so scared.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,500
I thought you were dead for real.

142
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,180
Did I do it so well?

143
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,100
Who are you?

144
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,740
(Fang Tao)

145
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,060
I live here. I just moved in.

146
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Even if you don't take a nap,

147
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,220
don't disturb others.

148
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,140
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,460
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,820
Sorry.

151
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,180
Going to work?

152
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,500
Sorry for disturbing your nap.

153
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,460
I'll hurry up

154
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,700
and try to finish it by the end of the day.

155
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Thank you.

156
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
It's ok.

157
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,320
Thanks.

158
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,180
If there's any problem,

159
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,460
call the telephone exchange.

160
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,480
Ok, ok.

161
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,340
Thanks.

162
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,740
You're welcome.

163
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,440
Hello, Jiali.

164
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,930
Guess where I am.

165
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm at Mom's house.

166
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,420
I'll let Mom talk to you. Here, Mom.

167
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,700
- Jiali.
- Hello.

168
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,140
Installed.

169
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,260
I'm hanging up.

170
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,380
Hang on.

171
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,780
Yes.

172
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,220
Ouyang got a number from the telephone bureau

173
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,620
and installed a phone for Mom.

174
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,500
Number? Hang on.

175
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,900
It is

176
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,900
716991.

177
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,940
716991. Did you write it down?

178
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,980
Hang up.

179
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,620
Listen to me,

180
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,700
tell Jianguo to claim a refund

181
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,300
of the initial installation fee.

182
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,020
We are sisters.

183
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,620
It doesn't matter which of us does this.

184
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,420
Ok, I'm hanging up.

185
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,210
I have a few more calls to make. Bye.

186
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,900
Who are you calling?

187
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,780
Jiawen.

188
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,620
We should tell her your number.

189
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,820
- It's expensive.
- What's her number?

190
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,100
Hello, Jiawen.

191
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,820
Guess where I am.

192
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,060
I'm at Mom's house.

193
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,880
Yes, we just installed a phone for her.

194
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,100
You got it, right?

195
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,260
Call her on this number.

196
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,660
It is

197
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,500
716991.

198
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,620
- Enough.
- 716991.

199
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,340
Morning.

200
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,520
(Water shut off for repair)

201
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,380
It's broken.

202
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,420
I have water.

203
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,460
This is for you.

204
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,060
Thanks.

205
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,060
(Public Toilet)

206
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,060
Why didn't you lock the door?

207
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,660
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,420
I thought I locked it.

209
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,860
Maybe it didn't work.

210
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,220
The lock was broken last time.

211
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,180
Now it's fixed.

212
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Feel free to use it.

213
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,460
(Occupied)

214
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,500
(Unoccupied)

215
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
Who is it?

216
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,420
Your neighbor.

217
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
I've never seen you cooking.

218
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,740
I made a few more dishes

219
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,020
and I want you to taste some.

220
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,060
Come in.

221
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,940
You're welcome.

222
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,420
What did you say?

223
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,420
Aren't you going to eat?

224
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Come in and eat with me.

225
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,900
Want a drink?

226
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,220
I don't have any.

227
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,820
There's a cup behind you.

228
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,660
You're a good cook.

229
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,100
I cook a lot.

230
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,900
You don't cook much, right?

231
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,380
It's too much trouble to cook.

232
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,540
More importantly,

233
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,300
I have to lose weight.

234
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,220
You're not heavy.

235
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,420
Besides, you can't lose weight by dieting.

236
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
You have to exercise.

237
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,420
Still, I can't eat too much.

238
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,460
I should control my appetite.

239
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm not young anymore.

240
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,980
Nothing can change my love for life.

241
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,820
I smiled as I walked into the heat of life.

242
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,020
I remember you sitting on the stairs reading.

243
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
I read now and then.

244
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Thanks for your food.

245
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,060
Thanks, new neighbor.

246
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,260
Jiahuan, it's cold and why...

247
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,860
Jiawen.

248
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,740
This is my second sister.

249
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,180
Hello.

250
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,020
You have a guest.

251
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,700
You're eating.

252
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,460
And drinking?

253
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,900
Sit.

254
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,940
Sit down.

255
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,980
Go ahead and eat.

256
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,460
You can eat and talk, right?

257
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,940
I'll help you.

258
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,420
Thanks.

259
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,860
Jiahuan,

260
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,660
would you introduce him?

261
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,620
Jiawen, he is...

262
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,700
Introduce yourself.

263
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
I'm Fang Tao.

264
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,860
I work in the Grain Bureau's fleet.

265
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,860
I live next door.

266
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,060
Fang Tao?

267
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,820
Fang Tao.

268
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,020
How old are you?

269
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,940
I

270
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,780
was born in 1960.

271
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,820
Jiawen,

272
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
he moved here less than a week ago.

273
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,100
Fang Tao, did you make all this food?

274
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,460
Good.

275
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Good neighbor.

276
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,700
- Help yourselves.
- Ok.

277
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,740
May your family grow quickly!

278
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,500
- Thanks.
- Have some more.

279
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,500
- Zhou.
- Come here.

280
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
Congratulations!

281
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,660
Thanks!

282
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,780
Dance for us!

283
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,500
Dance for us! Dance!

284
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,180
(Wedding for Tang Zhenmin and Liu Xiaoling)

285
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,980
Xiaoling is good.

286
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,580
She dances so well.

287
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,540
Come on, dance!

288
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,580
Qiufang,

289
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,140
here's to you.

290
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,620
What for?

291
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,220
Because of you, they have a place to live.

292
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,260
Come on.

293
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,780
I'll drink up. Suit yourself.

294
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,740
We're family. Don't speak like strangers.

295
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,420
Besides, there's less of us now.

296
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,540
There's room for them.

297
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,620
You weren't obligated to do this,

298
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,700
yet you did.

299
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,740
You're kind and reasonable.

300
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,620
A sister-in-law is like a mom.

301
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,540
Zhenmin is lucky

302
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
to marry Xiaoling.

303
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,030
Xiaoling is kind,

304
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,180
but she's reckless

305
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,540
and doesn't think things through.

306
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,900
Now that she's married into your family,

307
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,300
you should teach her more.

308
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,940
Rest assured.

309
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,100
Suit yourself.

310
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,540
No more drinking.

311
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,980
Mom, why didn't you knock?

312
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,340
I'm your mom.

313
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,840
What can't you show me?

314
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,980
Don't hide it.

315
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,540
I've seen it.

316
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,220
Who's the apple for?

317
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,620
Is it He Jiaxi?

318
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,940
It's her, really!

319
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,780
No wonder

320
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,420
you've been distracted

321
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,980
since you came back from the mall.

322
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,890
I wonder why you always smile. Again?

323
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,110
Mom,

324
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,460
he Jiaxi is your apprentice.

325
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,890
If, I mean if.

326
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,420
Isn't it great

327
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,300
if we're a couple?

328
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,220
Not at all.

329
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,620
I don't agree.

330
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,700
Why?

331
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,380
She's fine as an apprentice,

332
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,780
but not as a daughter-in-law.

333
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,220
The standards are different.

334
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,940
Why do you have two standards?

335
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,140
What's wrong with Jiaxi?

336
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,940
Don't you know?

337
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,900
She has five sisters

338
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
and she is the youngest.

339
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
She's been spoiled since she was little.

340
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,020
She is self-centered.

341
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,820
I think she is good.

342
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,180
She's got guts

343
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,020
and a sense of humor.

344
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,340
She's fun.

345
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,780
What do you mean?

346
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,980
Have you made up your mind?

347
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,620
Do you have to be with her?

348
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,870
Cut the crap.

349
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,060
Mom.

350
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,780
Mom.

351
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,340
- Mom.
- What?

352
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,580
Help me.

353
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,780
Look at you.

354
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,500
Fine, I'll help you.

355
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,420
Here you are.

356
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,500
Thanks.

357
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
Goodbye.

358
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,220
- Bye.
- Thanks.

359
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,580
Good, you work well.

360
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,700
You taught me well.

361
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,580
Jiaxi.

362
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,300
What do you think of my son, Hongyu?

363
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,740
I don't know him well.

364
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,420
First time strangers, second time friends.

365
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,140
You've known him for so long.

366
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,580
Don't you know him well?

367
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,260
Hongyu

368
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,540
is honest and warm.

369
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,100
You're absolutely right.

370
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,140
Everyone at the No. 2 Car Factory

371
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,340
compliments my son.

372
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,220
He's skilled,

373
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
hard-working,

374
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
and good-looking.

375
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,420
People can't help but like him.

376
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,700
He has many admirers.

377
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,780
Good for him.

378
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,740
He can easily find a wife.

379
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,040
He doesn't like ordinary girls.

380
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,820
What kind of girl does he like?

381
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,620
I don't know.

382
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,380
But

383
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,580
he always compliments you to me.

384
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,420
Does he?

385
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,140
What does he say?

386
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,180
Mom.

387
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,940
Son, you're here.

388
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,660
Well, he'll tell you himself.

389
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,500
Hongyu.

390
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm at work. It's not a good idea.

391
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,940
Then eat it after work.

392
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,300
Your mom said you complimented me.

393
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,260
What did you say?

394
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,420
I think you're cultured,

395
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,500
virtuous,

396
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,380
and multi-talented.

397
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,460
You're very enthusiastic.

398
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,380
Ok, stop.

399
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,740
I get nervous when people compliment me.

400
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,980
Why?

401
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm afraid they won't do it enough.

402
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,500
You're funny.

403
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,940
(Video Lounge)

404
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,180
Watch the movie.

405
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,700
My hands are cold.

406
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,740
Mine aren't cold.

407
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,740
Mine are cold.

408
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,180
This is good.

409
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,740
Come on.

410
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Have you tried it?

411
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,580
No.

412
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,940
Stop lying. You look like an old hand.

413
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,820
I haven't.

414
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,340
Keep your voice down.

415
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,820
I swear to God.

416
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,580
Enough. How many vows do you make a day?

417
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,340
God is annoyed with you.

418
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,180
Anyway, I mean it.

419
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,020
Mean what?

420
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,110
I'm committed to you

421
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,230
for the rest of my life.

422
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,380
What?

423
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,460
I want to be with you.

424
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,380
Be with you

425
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,460
and good to you.

426
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Watch the movie, ok?

427
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,980
Stop talking.

428
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,260
Ok, I'm sorry.

429
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,100
Look.

430
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,780
Jiaxi.

431
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,500
You can leave now.

432
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,620
It's not time yet.

433
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,220
It's ok, just a few minutes away.

434
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,500
I'm here. Go ahead.

435
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,300
I'll cover for you next time, Master.

436
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,620
I'm off.

437
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,700
(Selections of Marx and Engels)

438
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,380
Thanks, honey.

439
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,100
What's wrong?

440
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,940
Jiahuan has a neighbor.

441
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,020
Jiahuan has a neighbor?

442
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,680
What's wrong?

443
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,780
A male neighbor.

444
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,260
Male neighbor?

445
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
And then?

446
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,340
Fang Tao from the Grain Bureau's fleet.

447
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,410
Fang Tao?

448
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,700
It sounds familiar.

449
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,550
What's the story with him?

450
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,580
Find it out for me.

451
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,910
Did Jiahuan ask you to do this?

452
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,400
Don't worry about that.

453
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,580
Just ask around.

454
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,180
I promise to finish the job.

455
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,580
Read your book.

456
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,460
I'll read a little more.

457

(Duties of the Transportation Fleet)

458
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,660
Hi, Li.

459
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,540
Why are you here?

460
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,820
Can't I come?

461
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
You can, of course.

462
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,620
If you need help, just call me.

463
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,900
I have a meeting. I just stopped by.

464
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,940
I want to ask you about someone.

465
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,020
Who?

466
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,340
Is there a man

467
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,140
called Fang Tao in your fleet?

468
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,620
Fang Tao?

469
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,460
- Yes.
- Yes?

470
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,940
Why do you ask about him?

471
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,020
Here is the thing.

472
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,900
Would you tell me

473
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,980
where this guy lives?

474
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,900
Warehouse 3, the former Station Road,

475
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,260
second son of the Fang family,

476
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,540
divorced.

477
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,100
His wife went into business with someone.

478
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,580
No kids.

479
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,500
Divorced.

480
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,940
His wife went into business.

481
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,180
What's wrong with divorce?

482
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,740
As long as he's a good man

483
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,020
and good to Jiahuan.

484
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,500
But Jiahuan has never been married.

485
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,740
She is a young girl.

486
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,940
As long as she likes him, it's fine.

487
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,140
Do you think I should tell Jiali?

488
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,020
Do you want to tell her?

489
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,940
Would she be upset?

490
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,580
Forget it.

491
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
I'll see what Jiahuan has to say.

492
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,220
(Huainan Anhuai Trust & Investment Co.)

493
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,220
Tell me.

494
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,540
Are you going to live there forever?

495
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,620
Why?

496
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,900
Is the Grain Bureau going to kick us out?

497
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,860
What do you think of Fang Tao?

498
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,220
Did Fang Tao send you?

499
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,740
I'm your sister.

500
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,980
Can't I care about you?

501
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,420
I'm representing myself.

502
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,940
He is

503
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
reliable and reserved,

504
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,940
not one for small talk,

505
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,220
but incredibly efficient.

506
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,740
Do you know him well?

507
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,160
No.

508
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,420
What does he know about you?

509
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,500
You should ask him.

510
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,380
He's divorced.

511
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,140
Do you know that?

512
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,540
What's wrong with divorce?

513
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,390
I wonder

514
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,260
if all divorced people

515
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,740
can't pursue happiness.

516
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,500
Jiahuan,

517
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,780
I didn't mean that.

518
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,340
You can pursue your happiness,

519
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,740
but you should know each other first.

520
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,140
My treat. You cook.

521
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,540
Good task. With pleasure.

522
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,340
That's what you eat every day?

523
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,580
Simple food is enough for me.

524
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,580
Several drops of soy sauce

525
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,500
make fried eggs

526
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,900
taste great.

527
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,220
But if we eat together,

528
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,420
we'll need two dishes and a soup.

529
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,380
I have an idea.

530
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,180
Let's cooperate.

531
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,740
How?

532
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,220
We'll eat together.

533
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,580
Seven days a week.

534
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,940
I'll pay for food for four days

535
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,900
and you pay for three days.

536
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,720
You cook dishes

537
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,900
and I cook staple food.

538
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,920
That way,

539
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,740
we'll make cooking

540
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,940
more efficient.

541
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,680
What do you think?

542
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,980
Do you agree with my proposal?

543
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,570
I'm afraid it'll affect you.

544
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,540
We're just eating together.

545
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,020
There's nothing to worry about.

546
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,340
You don't know me.

547
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Tell me about yourself.

548
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,420
I don't care. I'm a man.

549
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,220
I don't care either. I'm a woman.

550
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,940
Ok.

551
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,580
It's a deal.

552
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,740
Nice working together.

553
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,780
Let me peel the garlic for you.

554
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,340
Here.

555
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,380
I read from the newspaper today

556
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
that an actor

557
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,540
got divorced.

558
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,060
What do you think?

559
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,620
I don't pay much attention to showbiz.

560
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,380
Divorce

561
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,740
is no big deal these days,

562
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,420
right?

563
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,780
Jiali.

564
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,940
I'd like to have a word with you.

565
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,020
Go ahead.

566
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,780
How old is your mom?

567
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,700
My mom?

568
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,300
She was born in 1933.

569
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,260
1933?

570
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,100
I'll get right to the point.

571
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,540
Is your mom planning to remarry?

572
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,730
Well...

573
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,020
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

574
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,220
She needs an old companion

575
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,540
to be with her in her later years, right?

576
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,100
I don't know.

577
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,140
I'll ask her when I get home.

578
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,020
Ok, it's settled then.

579
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,140
This

580
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,380
isn't our call.

581
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,540
Mom has never thought

582
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,980
of remarrying after Dad died.

583
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,100
Is she

584
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,940
willing to do it now?

585
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,740
That's because we are a big family.

586
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,220
She got a job to do.

587
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,740
It's different now.

588
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,340
Didn't Wu on the other side of the road

589
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,540
find an old companion?

590
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,740
It's different.

591
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,780
We have Grandma.

592
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,500
How many more years can she live with Mom?

593
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,740
She'll probably die before Mom.

594
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Why don't you ask her?

595
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,140
If she wants to,

596
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,300
it would be a good thing.

597
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,700
How do I ask?

598
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,620
Set her up with someone.

599
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,500
You know a lot of people.

600
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,940
I sell vegetables now.

601
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,940
I don't know anyone suitable.

602
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,780
Any honest and reliable men?

603
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,860
None.

604
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,850
Why do you buy so many vegetables?

605
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,140
They're cheaper in the afternoon.

606
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,780
Why did you buy so many radishes?

607
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,020
Is there a radish meeting?

608
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,420
Mom wants to eat Eight Pickled Vegetables.

609
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,460
See you later.

610
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,620
How do you like it?

611
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,500
Good.

612
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,020
Better than your mom's.

613
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,060
The student surpasses the master.

614
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,780
(Ancestral Eight Pickled Vegetables)

615
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,500
Meixin.

616
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,820
(Ancestral Eight Pickled Vegetables)

617
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,940
Boy, are you doing business now?

618
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,060
We couldn't eat so much,

619
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,180
so I thought I might as well try my luck

620
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,500
and see if I could sell it.

621
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,140
It's ok.

622
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,460
It's good to have a small business.

623
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,700
But do you have a license?

624
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,660
License?

625
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,060
I need a license?

626
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,300
It's ok. I'll ask Weimin to get you one.

627
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,700
Thanks.

628
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,580
Don't mention it.

629
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,860
I envy you.

630
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,220
You have such a good skill.

631
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,940
Guys.

632
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,940
Are you trying to make a fortune, too?

633
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,420
You're wrong.

634
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,060
We're trying to revitalize the economy

635
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,340
for the benefit of society, right?

636
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,900
For the benefit of society.

637
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,940
Get her some to have a try.

638
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,980
Pickles?

639
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,860
Didn't you eat enough in the hard times?

640
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,660
What we ate was pickled turnip.

641
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,100
These are authentic Pickled Vegetables.

642
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,460
Pickled Vegetables.

643
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,100
Aren't they pickles?

644
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,300
What's so special about them?

645
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,860
- Have a try.
- Ok.

646
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,660
How do you like it?

647
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,740
Is it good?

648
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,300
You know what,

649
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,100
it's sweet

650
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,740
and sour.

651
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,660
- Is it good?
- Yeah, definitely.

652
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,460
It's crunchy. Get me a little.

653
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,900
- Is it good?
- Yeah, very good.

654
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,260
- Come on, get her some.
- Really?

655
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,110
Get me a little.

656
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,940
- Hurry, come on.
- I've got to support you.

657
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,900
- Here you are.
- How much?

658
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,980
The first guest is free of charge.

659
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,900
No.

660
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,060
You must take the money.

661
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,540
- No. No.
- Take the money.

662
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,380
Next time, I'll charge you.

663
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,820
- Take the money.
- To support you.

664
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,420
(Yanhuai Road, 28)

665
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,580
Does she stay out so late every day?

666
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,060
Sometimes she's back earlier.

667
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,860
I usually

668
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,180
cook noodles

669
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,180
and save some food for her.

670
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,820
I'm worried about you being home alone.

671
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,340
You have to cook for yourself.

672
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,020
She's been bored since retirement.

673
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,980
She's been retired for a while.

674
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,020
She has to get used to it.

675
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,400
I don't oppose her doing business,

676
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,860
but she should pay attention to her health.

677
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,460
Your mom is happy.

678
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,620
Don't blame her.

679
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,020
One more thing.

680
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,580
Ms. Zhang from the North

681
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,380
wants to set Mom up with an old man.

682
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,420
He is well off

683
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,620
and is a retired cadre.

684
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,780
You should ask your mom.

685
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,140
