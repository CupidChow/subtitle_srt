(Previously)
I saw Fahlan kissing a guy last night at the bar.

13
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,742
- Who was it this time?
- It was Sher.

14
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:20,937
Sherbet, the Architecture major.

15
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:23,323
If you saw them with your own eyes,

16
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:27,354
I'm sure you'll stop liking him.

17
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:31,346
Tar, thank you so much.
This is the best news ever.

18
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:32,495
Hey.

19
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:35,518
Shit, Sherbet is with Prince.

20
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,338
That's Sher.

21
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,870
I heard that he's not looking for something serious.

22
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:44,049
You can only be... his one-night stand.

23
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:45,252
Just wait and see.

24
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:48,143
I'll make Sher my boyfriend.

25
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,206
You're so drunk. Do you need a ride, Sher?

26
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:55,635
I'll make you moan
like you'll never forget.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,057
Hey, don't get up yet.

28
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,870
Let's cuddle some more.

29
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:02,448
I'll take you home after.

30
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,658
No.

31
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,651
A fuck buddy and my private life...
I want to keep them apart.

32
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:13,182
You want to keep
a fuck buddy and your private life apart.

33
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:16,846
Does "private life" mean boyfriend?

34
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:17,885
If so,

35
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,424
I can be just a friend.

36
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,026
Friends don't sleep with each other.

37
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:26,120
Your logic is fucked up.

38
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:28,682
Friends with benefits.

39
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,628
Friends who fuck.

40
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:46,446
No, thanks. I don't like
to sleep with the same person.

41
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:49,836
Huh?

42
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,422
Am I not sassy enough for you?

43
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,485
You... suck.

44
00:02:57,953 --> 00:02:58,821
I suck?

45
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:00,821
I suck?

46
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,797
But you slept with me twice.

47
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,368
"Oh, Fahlan."

48
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:10,055
- Fuck you.
- "Oh, Fahlan."

49
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,071
Come on. "Oh, Fahlan."

50
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,133
Stop it. You'll be late for class.

51
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,145
I asked that question

52
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:24,888
because I thought it was great.

53
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:27,825
Are you hooked on me?

54
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:34,364
I have to admit.

55
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:37,848
You... are amazing.

56
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,723
But you still suck.

57
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,245
I'll let you say that again.

58
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,527
Come on. Tell me.

59
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:04,773
Fine.

60
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:07,288
I was just talking nonsense.

61
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:09,288
You are amazing too.

62
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,729
Last night.

63
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:22,870
I... pretended to moan
and now my throat hurts.

64
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,310
You won't make it to class today, Sher.

65

(The Wind of Love)

66
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,615
What? Really?

67
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,287
I'm so happy.

68
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,193
Sure. Okay.

69
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,334
Okay, that's fine.

70
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,951
This is all going perfectly.

71
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:11,294
When you don't back off
from the happiness you want,

72
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:16,255
you will get to feel the happiness
from your effort

73
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:23,067
even if you have to face
the sun and the rain

74
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:26,755
that make us hot and wet.

75
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,904
But once you overcome the struggles,

76
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:35,606
the cold breeze will make you
calm and peaceful.

77
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,091
So, let's be friends.

78
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,458
I haven't agreed to it.

79
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:52,998
I'm forcing you to.

80
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,078
You always get what you want, right?

81
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:03,618
Yes, I do.

82
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:07,532
Fine then.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,657
Nice to meet you, friend with benefits.

84
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:22,741
What's the matter with you?

85
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:26,592
- I'm leaving.
- See you at the university.

86
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:31,117
There are so many buildings.
We are from very different departments.

87
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,847
- I'll call you.
- You don't have my number.

88
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,081
I will if you save your number.

89
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:49,404
Go ahead.

90
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:00,282
Call yourself.

91
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:14,067
Put your name in.

92
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,801
You know my name.

93
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,333
Do it yourself.

94
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,583
I want you to do it.

95
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,457
Put whatever name you want.

96
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:31,621
If not, I'll kiss and cuddle you
until you do.

97
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:35,379
Or you want me to do it?

98
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,988
I'll save your number under "Wifey."

99
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,051
Are you happy now?

100
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,681
(Sherbet)

101
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:57,871
What about you?
What name would you put in for my number?

102
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:00,949
None of your business. I'll do it.

103
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,871
Do it now. I don't want you to lose my number.

104
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,339
Don't get all excited.

105
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,823
I'll delete your number while I walk away.

106
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:37,014
Walk carefully. Don't fall in love.

107
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,342
Come on. There's no need for that.

108
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:58,899
Here. Drink it.

109
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:12,355
Much better.

110
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,772
I told you not to drink too much.

111
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:26,805
Damn. Will you puke
your intestines out too?

112
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,305
You're puking too much.

113
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,305
Stop it, Ping.

114
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:34,985
Unlike you, I didn't pretend to pass out
while drinking and looking at girls.

115
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:37,611
What?

116
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:39,416
So this is my fault?

117
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,041
I didn't pretend to pass out.

118
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,056
I actually passed out.

119
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,900
We should have gone home,
but kept wanting to drink.

120
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,291
Who's the one who wanted to look at girls?

121
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,502
Hey, Fah.

122
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:58,220
What's wrong with Tap?

123
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,408
He's a lightweight who is hungover.

124
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,668
Did you guys hook up last night?

125
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,059
- Are you nuts?
- Are you nuts?

126
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,137
- I'm picky.
- Me too.

127
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,145
I'm not easy like you, Fah.

128
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm not easy.

129
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,762
But I'm not difficult when it comes to sex.

130
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:19,582
Are you talking about Sher?

131
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,051
So, did you sleep with him again?

132
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,762
You're so nosy, Ping.

133
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,192
Go find him some hot food.

134
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:29,028
So he doesn't pass out in class.

135
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,574
Yeah, you're right.

136
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:35,918
Right, Mr. Lightweight?

137
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:54,657
Hey, Gear.

138
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,626
What about my bread and juice?

139
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:58,946
I didn't forget.

140
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:02,431
Here.

141
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,153
Thanks, Wifey.

142
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:12,426
Where are you going, Sher?
It's almost time for class.

143
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,982
I'm going to find
a place to sit around here.

144
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:17,075
Go get seats in class, Prince.

145
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,653
Take care of him, Gear.

146
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,796
He asked you to take care of me,
not put your arms around me.

147
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:43,496
Where are you rushing to, Pink?

148
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,394
- A personal business.
- Wait.

149
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,105
What about our production meeting
this afternoon?

150
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,643
Don't you have to finish
the rehearsal schedule for the actors?

151
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:53,413
It's only 11.30 a.m.
I still have time, Tar.

152
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:54,703
Hold on.

153
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,507
Where are you going? What about lunch?

154
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,234
You really have to know, don't you?

155
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,066
Yes, I want to know.

156
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,777
Is it a secret?

157
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:07,198
- A date with a guy?
- Yes, so what?

158
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,089
Let me go with you.

159
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,722
Fine, follow me.

160
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,667
But promise me that you'll keep quiet for once.

161
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:19,027
- I don't want my plans ruined.
- Of course.

162
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:21,378
I... I'll do what you say.

163
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:45,990
Hey, Fah.

164
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:48,724
Why are you so nosy?

165
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,974
If you're too afraid to ask, I'll do it.

166
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,396
Calm down, Ping. Wait until the class is over.

167
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,482
I can't.

168
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:02,928
This is killing me right now.

169
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:06,849
Hey, Fah.

170
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,107
So did you and Sherbet
sleep together again last night?

171
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,974
- Yes.
- See? I told you.

172
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:21,926
Is Sher that great in bed?

173
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:24,606
Is that why you slept with him twice?

174
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,465
Ping.

175
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,433
Some things... should be kept private.

176
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,410
Think about what is appropriate
to say and ask.

177
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,910
Hey.

178
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:48,011
It's fine, man. Come here.

179
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,003
- I told you so.
- Hey.

180
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,112
Hey, Pink.

181
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,347
I waited for a long time.

182
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,128
I tried my best to come early.

183
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:06,456
Arm, this is my friend, Tar.

184
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:09,315
Tar, this is Arm, my high school friend
who goes to a different university.

185
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,042
Hello.

186
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,653
- Hello.
- Arm.

187
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:16,129
You wouldn't tell me over the phone.
I want to know so bad I couldn't focus.

188
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:20,075
Come on. It wouldn't be as fun
if I told you over the phone, right?

189
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,037
- You're right.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:25,639
You told me that Fahlan and Sherbet
are back to speaking. What happened next?

191
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,545
The thing is...

192
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:02,309
here is the proof.

193
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:05,536
I don't want you to think
I'm making things up.

194
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:08,177
Arm, this is so adorable.

195
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:12,825
I'm confident that
Fahlan has already slept with Sherbet.

196
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,403
From what I can tell,

197
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,972
I think Fahlan was trying to approach him
because he took him home.

198
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:21,880
This is amazing.

199
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:26,966
Do you like him that much
to have him followed?

200
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:30,341
Hey, I wasn't following him.

201
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,598
I was there and I'm just sharing my story.

202
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:35,286
Great job.

203
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:37,012
Arm knows me best.

204
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:38,747
What happened next?

205
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:40,442
Come on, Pink.

206
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,465
That was it.
Do you expect me to go home with them?

207
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,209
Of course not, but I thought...

208
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:52,655
- Maybe they hooked up in the car.
- Come on, Pink.

209
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,873
What's the matter, Tar? I like him.

210
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,490
- Damn.
- Right.

211
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,850
That's her happiness. It makes her happy.

212
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,561
But...

213
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,865
Fahlan and Sherbet are guys, right?

214
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:11,178
Aren't you upset that he likes men?

215
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:13,162
Come on.

216
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:14,576
Why would she be upset?

217
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,826
That's her happiness. It makes her happy.

218
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:20,811
Is that possible?

219
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:21,975
- Of course.
- Of course.

220
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,404
Huh?

221
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:26,514
What's up with this world?

222
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:32,233
Welcome to the world of Pink,
who is the biggest fan of Boys' Love.

223
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:34,084
You deserve the crown.

224
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,476
- I want to see more.
- Right?

225
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,929
They really kissed.

226
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:42,172
- So cute.
- I know.

227
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,335
What is Sher doing?

228
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,523
Why doesn't he pick up his phone?

229
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:08,773
Fah, do you want some food?
I'll get it for you.

230
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,429
No, I'm not hungry.

231
00:17:13,593 --> 00:17:14,812
Hey.

232
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:17,117
Did Ping fall into the toilet?

233
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,812
Why is he not back yet?
I thought it would be fast.

234
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,031
Don't wait for him.

235
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:26,836
He's not in the bathroom.
He's upset with you.

236
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:29,172
With me?

237
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,891
- What is this about?
- About what you said in class.

238
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,859
Oh, he deserved that.

239
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,094
It's not something he should talk about.

240
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,105
You're right about that.

241
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,777
But, Fah...

242
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,902
it's not just him who wants to know.

243
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:51,605
I do too.

244
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:55,496
But Ping used the wrong words.

245
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,749
You seem to give importance to Sher.

246
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:07,078
I give importance to all my flings.

247
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:08,921
It's not strange.

248
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:11,480
Fah.

249
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:14,198
Even though you say
that you're not interested in him,

250
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,253
you were since the first day you met him

251
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,417
or you wouldn't be this distracted.

252
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:21,300
That's why Ping's worried about you.

253
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,261
Do you guys think I'm in love with Sherbet?

254
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,190
Ask yourself.

255
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,378
If you love him, then keep going.

256
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,268
But if you're just looking for a fling,
I think you should back out.

257
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:40,565
You'll get hurt.

258
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:41,932
Why is that?

259
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,882
Because someone who doesn't believe in love

260
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,069
usually cannot find happiness in love,

261
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,343
so he's not satisfied enough
to settle with anyone.

262
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,408
So you're not going to eat anything, right?

263
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,424
I'll go find Ping.

264
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:10,025
I don't know where he is.
Maybe he jumped off the building.

265
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:11,713
He's sensitive.

266
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:23,418
I asked that question

267
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,207
because I thought it was great.

268
00:19:29,921 --> 00:19:30,960
No way.

269
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,210
I'm not that into love.

270
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,820
- Pink.
- What is it, Tar?

271
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:45,531
How can you be so sure that
Fahlan and Sherbet will become a couple?

272
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:49,413
Because you saw them kissing once, right?

273
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:54,132
- Yes.
- Arm saw them going home together once.

274
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:57,781
You're right. How are they related though?

275
00:19:58,062 --> 00:19:59,367
Of course they are.

276
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:02,335
Because Sherbet never sleeps
with anyone twice.

277
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,359
That means Fah is more special.

278
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,062
- Do you get it now?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,648
- Good.
- I think I get it.

280
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:31,004
I called you so many times.
Why didn't you pick up?

281
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:36,848
What's with this look?
Are you meeting someone?

282
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:40,801
My little brother. I don't see him often.

283
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:43,332
Your real brother

284
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,527
or your brother with benefits?

285
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,832
My real brother. Do you believe me?

286
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:50,473
Are you sure?

287
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,121
You'll get to meet him soon.

288
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,340
By the way,

289
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:01,887
this looks suits you.

290
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:05,668
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

291
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm starving.

292
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,027
I can swallow you whole.

293
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:14,973
Do it then.

294
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,191
Don't flirt with me.
I'll kiss you right here

295
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,691
and make you moan like last night.

296
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:31,155
- You're always so horny, Fah.
- Hey.

297
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,444
Sher.

298
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:38,553
You have a twin brother?

299
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,392
You play me so well.

300
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:48,916
Look carefully before you act all horny.

301
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:51,690
Tam, this is Fahlan.

302
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:54,600
Hello, Fahlan.

303
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm Chertame,
a senior from the Medicine Department.

304
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,272
I'm his older twin.

305
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,627
I... I have to go buy some food.

306
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:13,189
Wait, weren't you going
to swallow me whole?

307
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:17,166
Stop it, Tam.
He's already dying from embarrassment.

308
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,192
Is he your new boyfriend?

309
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:28,754
What boyfriend?
You know I'm not looking for one.

310
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,262
Come on.

311
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:33,543
Don't deny it just yet.
It seems like he cares about you.

312
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,840
I... haven't seen you
smile like this in awhile.

313
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,398
Nonsense.

314
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:51,388
Damn it.

315
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,614
I'm such an idiot.

316
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:58,935
What a mistake. What a big mistake.

317
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,318
I finally found you.

318
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,459
How did you know that I was here?

319
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:21,498
You told me once

320
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,248
that the library is quiet.

321
00:23:25,396 --> 00:23:27,928
You like to come here when you're upset.

322
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:31,443
I'll just read here.

323
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:33,747
I won't bother you.

324
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,067
I didn't realize
that you could read upside down.

325
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:14,413
I'm full. I have to go.

326
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,624
Let's eat together next time,
my future brother-in-law.

327
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:28,260
Come swallow me whole next time.

328
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,370
Get lost, asshole.

329
00:24:47,491 --> 00:24:48,522
What?

330
00:24:48,725 --> 00:24:50,694
- Oh.
- Oh.

331
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:53,901
That's Fahlan and Sherbet.

332
00:24:53,956 --> 00:24:55,182
Fahlan.

333
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,081
I'm embarrassed.

334
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:01,159
You deserved that.

335
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:04,159
Why didn't you tell me you have a twin?

336
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,237
Why should I? We're not dating.

337
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:12,932
So I wouldn't have
to embarrass myself like that.

338
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,580
Here, your chicken skin.

339
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:22,923
- So you don't have to ask me again.
- Fah.

340
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,600
- This couple is so perfect.
- Yes.

341
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:34,452
That's right. You've got it bad.

342
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:36,132
They're so cute.

343
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,813
- Do you want some chicken skin?
- You're a pervert, Tar.

344
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,122
Thank you for staying with me.

345
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:54,122
I'm glad you feel better.

346
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,919
Were you worried about me?

347
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:01,068
Of course.

348
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,403
You tend to overthink.

349
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,419
Fah was right.

350
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:09,193
It was personal.

351
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,732
It had nothing to do with me.
I was just nosy.

352
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,263
You are his friend.

353
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:20,880
Sometimes being worried
makes us cross the line.

354
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:23,872
I'm going to apologize to him.

355
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah.

356
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,522
Aren't you hungry? You didn't have lunch.

357
00:26:29,116 --> 00:26:31,538
Right, I feel hungry now.

358
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,577
I forgot that I didn't eat.

359
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:37,053
What about hotpot? I want something hot.

360
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:39,178
Sure, I'll text Fah.

361
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,061
Do you have classes after?

362
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:51,780
No.

363
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,585
But I have band rehearsal.

364
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,022
Why? Are you going to ask me out?

365
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:08,036
I saved your number,
but your LINE account didn't show up.

366
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:10,145
You're so annoying.

367
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:13,293
You have my number,
why do you need my LINE?

368
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,879
To text you when you don't pick up.

369
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:18,458
Fuck you.

370
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,614
If you don't give it to me,

371
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,013
I'll kiss you right here.

372
00:27:58,756 --> 00:27:59,756
Accept my invitation.

373
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:01,912
You're an asshole.

374
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:06,131
If you block me, I'll hunt you down.

375
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:14,776
Ask yourself.

376
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,706
If you love him, then keep going.

377
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:20,678
But if you're just looking for a fling,

378
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:22,835
I think you should back out.

379
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:24,843
You'll get hurt.

380
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,405
I like him and I want him.

381
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:31,268
I don't love him.

382
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:40,167
So we'll be rehearsing
every day after 5 p.m.

383
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:41,986
Regarding the actors,

384
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,743
let's have a workshop
the day after tomorrow,

385
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,152
so they can get familiar with one another.

386
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:49,626
Em, since you're the director,

387
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:51,837
you'll have to do the workshop alone

388
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:53,603
because we don't have an acting coach.

389
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:57,157
I want to have a session
with Fahlan alone first.

390
00:28:57,478 --> 00:28:58,243
Sure.

391
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,017
Jam and Tar, please print out the schedule,
so we can pass it out to everyone.

392
00:29:03,087 --> 00:29:04,040
Fah's schedule...

393
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,157
- I will bring it to him.
- I will bring it to him.

394
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:08,462
You are right.

395
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:12,798
Are you or Em choosing the costumes?
I've finished the initial design.

396
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:14,610
Well...

397
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,594
I'll help Em choose them,
so he can focus more on the actors.

398
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:19,313
Okay.

399
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:21,923
Jam, what about the sponsors?

400
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:26,110
The team has sent out the documents,
but no one has responded yet.

401
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,501
I'll follow up on this.

402
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,360
Okay, good.

403
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,056
Let's get back to our work.

404
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,665
Tar, can I have the schedule by 3 p.m.?

405
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:36,703
- Sure.
- Okay. Meeting's over.

406
00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:39,641
Yeah.

407
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:10,471
Ping, are you going to eat
or play with your phone?

408
00:30:10,861 --> 00:30:13,127
Just choose one.

409
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:16,307
Don't beg me to come next time.

410
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:19,814
I'm eating too.

411
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:25,439
Hey.

412
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:28,916
What's the matter?

413
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:39,421
"I'm a kind person.
I hope he knows how I feel."

414
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:55,472
"I'm a kind person.
I hope he knows how I feel."

415
00:30:56,831 --> 00:31:00,448
#Fah'sSher

416
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,356
Shit.

417
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,028
Why does my face look so dark?

418
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,262
Huh? Look at this.

419
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,934
The one who took this doesn't know
about lighting.

420
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:19,895
Fah.

421
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,379
It's not just your face.

422
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:24,582
Your ears are too.

423
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:30,512
Tap.

424
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:35,303
They're not and I'm not a player.

425
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:39,623
Aren't you scared?

426
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:42,279
The pictures were posted
to our university's Cute Boy page.

427
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,584
Why should I be scared, Ping?

428
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,482
You told me

429
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,131
that my pictures get posted there often.

430
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:57,060
What if your boy Tle sees them?

431
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:03,810
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

432
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,494
I'm glad you did.

433
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:14,385
I want to tell you not to worry about me.

434
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:18,010
I can handle it. I know him well.

435
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:24,252
Thank you for caring about and warning me, Ping.

436
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:28,744
Eat quickly. I have tennis practice later.

437
00:32:33,939 --> 00:32:37,165
See? Speak of the devil.

438
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,033
What are you doing, Fah?

439
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,747
Hurry up. I gotta get ready.

440
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,255
Right, eat up.

441
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,748
Sher.

442
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,287
Let me take a nap. I'm exhausted.

443
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,873
Why is the rehearsal over so early today?

444
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:17,112
Look at me when you're talking to me.

445
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:20,221
I haven't seen you much lately, Wifey.

446
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,080
You like to call me that.
People will misunderstand.

447
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:27,080
I don't care what anyone thinks.

448
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:30,885
Why? Are you afraid Gear will be upset?

449
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,510
How is this related to him?

450
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:39,526
You should be careful.
Fahlan might misunderstand.

451
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,541
None of my business. I don't care.

452
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:47,056
- That means you haven't seen the pictures.
- What pictures?

453
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:51,651
The pictures of you and Fah being all cute
at the cafeteria this noon.

454
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:55,729
The pictures on Cute Boy
got over 10,000 likes.

455
00:33:56,072 --> 00:34:00,697
Everyone's so anxious to see
if Fahlan can win your heart.

456
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:04,877
Or has he won it already?

457
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:13,567
No one can replace you, Prince.

458
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,528
Come on, Silly Boo.

459
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,473
Silly Boo?

460
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,319
See you, man.

461
00:34:41,436 --> 00:34:43,842
- Pink.
- Hello, Fah.

462
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:47,444
Oh, here's your rehearsal schedule.

463
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,395
The schedule fits
with the one you sent over.

464
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:51,366
Please have a look at it.

465
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:53,569
Oh, okay.

466
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:56,169
Sure, Pink.

467
00:34:56,927 --> 00:35:00,630
But... are you sure
you don't want to go with someone else?

468
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:04,669
I... have never acted before.

469
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,693
I'm not so confident.

470
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:10,513
Of course I am.
You are perfect for the role.

471
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,869
Then... I'll do my best.

472
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:18,588
- Okay.
- I have to shower. See you.

473
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:27,428
Ouch.

474
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,967
Ouch, what?

475
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:32,834
- He's so cute.
- You're crazy.

476
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:37,659
He's so cute.

477
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:19,724
Are you performing tonight?

478
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:21,685
Yes, why?

479
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,537
Get me a table.

480
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:25,583
The place is packed. Don't come.

481
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:27,552
All the tables are booked.

482
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:31,154
- What? A singer like you must have a table.
- I do.

483
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm going alone. I can sit with you.

484
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,677
You?

485
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:40,302
Fine, the table is booked under my name.

486
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,849
Okay, see you.

487
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,148
(Tle, I'm going out with friends.)

488
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,402
Tle, I'm going out with friends.

489
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:05,058
Take care of yourself, Fah.

490
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:14,254
(Korb-Lok Music Bar)

491
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,269
Excuse me, did you book a table?

492
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,394
We're all booked.

493
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,262
I'm with Sherbet.

494
00:37:23,287 --> 00:37:25,715
I see. Please come this way.

495
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:29,052
Here is your table.

496
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:37,114
I'll get you your drink.
Sher already ordered it for you.

497
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,821
He knows me well.

498
00:37:50,864 --> 00:37:51,747
Thank you.

499
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:55,051
Hey, Fahlan is handsome.

500
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,895
You keep looking at him.
You want to try, don't you?

501
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,434
It's worth the risk.

502
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,215
I'll be back.

503
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:09,111
Are you here alone, Fahlan?

504
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,954
I'm waiting for my friend.

505
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,407
I see.

506
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:16,595
You can sit with me
while you wait for your friend.

507
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,532
Well... okay.

508
00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:23,556
Please excuse me. I need to make a call.

509
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:52,950
Tle.

510
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:10,180
(Next Episode)
I'll take you home.

511
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:13,383
To your kinky room?

512
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,836
You have a hidden agenda. I know it.

513
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,282
I'm worried about Fah.

514
00:39:18,696 --> 00:39:21,344
Do you think he'll be successful with Sher?

515
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:25,493
You didn't lock the door.
You're flirting with me, aren't you?

516
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,477
You are the first person

517
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:32,618
who I brought home to sleep in my bed.

518
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,563
You've changed so much
ever since you met Fah.

519
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:38,477
When did you guys start dating?

520
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:40,649
Dating? We're not dating.

521
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,688
I'm still the same.
You're the only one for me.

522
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:47,118
So stubborn. You even let him do your hair.

523
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,993
Is buttoning the shirt
all the way up a new trend?

524
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,868
- You've done it for many days now.
- Hey.

525
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,469
Damn.

526
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:40,938
