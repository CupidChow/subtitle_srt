Do you really like Nont?

13
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:17,902
- Yes Fah.
- Go date him.

14
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:21,050
Wouldn't it be great
to break up with someone like me?

15
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:24,295
The Cute Boy page's making this a big deal.

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,334
Do you think Fah has seen this?

17
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,469
I already know.

18
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,696
- What?
- What?

19
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,179
What a coincidence.
I haven't seen you in awhile.

20
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,204
Your hair is a mess.

21
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:34,812
I'll help you.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,242
You've changed so much
ever since you met Fah.

23
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:38,769
When did you guys start dating?

24
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,515
Dating? We're not dating.

25
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,445
So stubborn. You even let him do your hair.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,380
Is buttoning the shirt
all the way up a new trend?

27
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:47,578
It's hot.

28
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:49,250
- You've done it for many days now.
- Hey.

29
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:51,073
Damn.

30
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,031
What you're doing now...

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,323
Do you think
it will make them fall in love?

32
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:59,628
Tar, love happens naturally.

33
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,823
It has nothing to do with me.

34
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:10,272
Will I get to see you tomorrow?

35
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:13,808
A one-night stand only happens once.

36
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:19,794
Not everyone is meant
to be successful in love.

37
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:24,301
Some people have a lover who has been
with them for a long time.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,130
They can break up over a night.

39
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:31,107
Some people hide their love

40
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,585
not to lose the one close to them.

41
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:38,289
But some people don't let love happen.

42
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:42,347
Because they don't want to lose
the people close to them.

Do you see how many fans
Fahlan and Sherbet have?

45
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,175
I posted only an hour ago.

46
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:57,257
- There are more than a thousand likes now.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:57,483 --> 00:03:01,233
I hope they're really dating like you hope.

48
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,145
I like what you said. I'll buy you food.

49
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,242
Thank you so much, Pink.

50
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:12,075
Ping, I'm no longer having hotpot.

51
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:14,449
We've had hotpot eight times this month.

52
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,282
I'm getting sick of it.

53
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,691
Fine, but you can't choose what we eat.

54
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:24,219
I hate your clean food.

55
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:25,789
It doesn't make me full.

56
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:30,051
Fine. Then eat at the cafeteria alone.

57
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,849
No way. Tap won't go with you.

58
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,968
He doesn't want to be a third wheel.

59
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,097
I can't hold it back anymore.

60
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,153
If I don't know, it will kill me.

61
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,226
What's going on with you and Sher?
Are you dating?

62
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,400
What about you and Tle?

63
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,797
Did he break up with you
because he found out?

64
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,524
Ping, stop it.

65
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,491
I was going to tell you.

66
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:01,548
But since you want to know so bad,
I won't tell you.

67
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:03,794
Watching you curious amuses me.

68
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:08,818
I think you should tell us.

69
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,472
I also want to know.

70
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:17,625
Fine.

71
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:20,747
I told him to break up with me.

72
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,842
I saw Tle with that guy
from the Engineering Department.

73
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:33,065
I saw them with my own eyes,
but I pretended not to know.

74
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:35,704
So you had an excuse to break up with him

75
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:38,671
and date Sher freely?

76
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,320
This had nothing to do with Sher.

77
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,336
When I saw Tle with him,
I couldn't be mean.

78
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:51,293
- I want him to be happy.
- Fah.

79
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,904
I know that you never break up
with anyone first.

80
00:04:56,523 --> 00:05:00,109
Because you feel sorry that
you only think of them as sex partners.

81
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,844
But it's different with Sher
whom you just met.

82
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,065
Why is it different?

83
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,415
As for Tle, I let him choose.

84
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:14,626
As for Sher, you seem more serious
than the other boys you've been with.

85
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,234
You only met him a few times.

86
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,191
You really like him, Fah.

87
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:31,587
Yeah, I like him.

88
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,676
I think he's special.

89
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,706
But it's just sex, right?

90
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,154
I just feel like

91
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,315
he's better than
the others I've slept with.

92
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,745
Sher and I

93
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,605
agreed on this.

94
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,747
So we decided to be friends with benefits.

95
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:55,339
Are you sure that it's really how you feel

96
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,451
and not just some excuse you use
because you want to keep him near you?

97
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:01,816
Yeah.

98
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:03,841
I really feel like that.

99
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,293
Sher feels the same way.

100
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:08,712
We're just having fun.

101
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,075
Just friends? Not a couple?

102
00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:15,465
But you sleep together like a couple?

103
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:18,509
Yeah.

104
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,142
Friends with benefits.

105
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,169
I understand

106
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,034
that Sher means more to you than that.

107
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:32,417
Trust me. You don't have to suffer
hiding your love.

108
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:35,064
There are people who want you.

109
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:37,972
- Sher too.
- How do you know?

110
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:43,746
The Cute Boy page posts often that
Sher is not close to anyone except Prince.

111
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,474
You're the only one whose lap he slept on.

112
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:54,431
Hey.

113
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,974
Continue eating and pay for me.

114
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:58,669
- I have to go.
- Hold on.

115
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:00,331
Where are you rushing to?

116
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,811
We don't have any classes after.
Stay and chat with us.

117
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,881
It's already 1 p.m.
I have the play rehearsal at 2 p.m.

118
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,252
- I'm going now.
- Wait.

119
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:12,850
The university is so close.

120
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:14,869
Why are you in a hurry?

121
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,485
Come on.

122
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,489
You're not rushing to the rehearsal.

123
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,368
You're going to meet Sher, right?

124
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,779
Yes, I'm meeting Sher. Hey.

125
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,946
That's enough. I need to go.
I can't be late.

126
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,245
Let him go.

127
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:41,147
If I find out that
you have a crush on someone,

128
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:42,961
I'll tell Fah.

129
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,351
I'm sure he'll tease you even more.

130
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:49,936
What's wrong?

131
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,044
You're acting more suspicious nowadays.

132
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:03,533
Pai, Fahlan's coming.

133
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:05,426
Fah.

134
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,232
Fah.

135
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:15,667
I'm Pai. I once asked you about Tle.

136
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:19,484
Pai?

137
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,595
Oh, I remember now.

138
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,711
What is it? I'm in a rush.

139
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:28,818
I bought you some water.
You seem tired from running here.

140
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:30,779
Thank you.

141
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:43,908
Hey.

142
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:45,689
Get me a new bottle.

143
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,675
I didn't buy it for him.

144
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,676
Come on. Can't you help a friend out?

145
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:54,786
I'll get you two bottles, okay?

146
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,435
Wow. You're unbelievable.

147
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:00,537
He has so many pictures with his boy.

148
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,932
You think you still have hope?

149
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,963
Why don't you try dating Fah?

150
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,917
No, I don't want a boyfriend.

151
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:22,298
You know that I'm not looking
for anything serious.

152
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,457
I'm just having fun. Being single is easy.

153
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,324
You don't want anything serious.
You want to be single.

154
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,532
But you let him get this close to you.

155
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,618
Why are you doing this, Sher?

156
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,108
Do what?

157
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,001
You're very protective of your hair.

158
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:43,727
It took me years before I could touch it.

159
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,587
But you even let him do your hair.

160
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:48,120
You slept on his lap.

161
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:52,171
If you didn't do that, I wouldn't know
that you are that close to him.

162
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:55,315
I told you that I just met him.

163
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,083
I'm just flirting with him.

164
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,693
You always say that I'm flirty.

165
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:02,954
Be careful then.

166
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:06,729
You'll get hurt playing
with other people's feelings.

167
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:12,951
Fahlan?

168
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,957
You are the first person

169
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:19,602
who I brought home to sleep in my bed.

170
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,306
Date Fah?

171
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:38,195
No way.

172
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,011
Hey, don't get up yet.

173
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,170
Let's cuddle some more.

174
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,375
You're not like anyone else.

175
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,323
That's why I don't even try to lie to you.

176
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,668
It was my kindness.

177
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,167
But love is what I want to offer more.

178
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,343
Sher.

179
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,148
I'm sorry we're late.
Did you wait for long?

180
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,426
Of course, you asshole.

181
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,235
Let's practice.

182
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:12,022
Okay.

183
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,908
(Fahlan)

184
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,991
Fah, why are you in a rush?

185
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,747
I thought I would be late.

186
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,306
Fah, you still have ten minutes.

187
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:46,618
Drink some water first.

188
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:54,585
Thank you for being on time, Fah.

189
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:56,246
I can't be late.

190
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,506
You trusted me.

191
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,933
I can't let you down.

192
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:05,157
Go sit inside.
I'll get some food and water for the team.

193
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:06,504
Okay.

194
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,905
Come on, Prince.

195
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:02,673
I've told everyone
that you're joining us today.

196
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,996
My goodness.

197
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:07,715
Are you going to a fashion show
or working out?

198
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:10,724
- You're wearing a lot of perfume.
- Too much?

199
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,676
I was afraid no one would smell it.

200
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,578
I wear this perfume too.

201
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:17,594
A little goes a long way.

202
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:21,185
I'll just spray it on my nose next time.

203
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:23,263
So I'll be sure.

204
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,352
You're quiet, but you're funny.

205
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,217
I'm funny, but I can never
make anyone fall for me.

206
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,255
Of course not.

207
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:38,448
I heard that pretty people fail,
but the funny ones succeed in love.

208
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:49,290
I hope I'm the funny one then.

209
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,721
Go practice. Your friends are waiting.

210
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:07,363
Nak stood at the end of the bridge
with her back to the river.

211
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:11,104
She looked at Mark who's walking
towards her with tears streaming down.

212
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:12,908
Mak stopped in front of her.

213
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:16,500
He used his hand
to wipe tears off her face.

214
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:18,590
Mak.

215
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,385
I have to go.

216
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,554
I can't stay and take care of you.

217
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:23,570
Nak.

218
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,529
No matter which world you are in,

219
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,978
please know that
you'll always be in my heart.

220
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,455
Nak sobbed, cried, and hugged him tight.

221
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,171
Mak.

222
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:37,546
Nak.

223
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,082
Dim the light and turn it off.

224
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:41,313
About five seconds.

225
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:44,452
Nak disappeared. Turn on the light again.

226
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,602
Mak stood still for awhile
and slowly walked to the end of the bridge.

227
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,442
He looked at the stream
and slowly looked up to the sky.

228
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:56,514
Don't worry about me, Nak.

229
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,832
My love for you

230
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:03,062
will never flow away like these streams.

231
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:07,722
After that, the bell rang three times

232
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,860
symbolizing Mak entering monkhood for life.

233
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,338
Bang. Bang. Bang.

234
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:22,683
What do you think, Em? Was I okay?

235
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,962
Okay? You did great.

236
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,410
Did you lie about not having acted before?

237
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:31,243
I told you that I chose the right person.
This role has to be played by Fahlan.

238
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,834
Yeah. What a show-off.

239
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:37,343
Yeah, Pink.

240
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,314
When they turn off the light,
you have to get on stage quickly.

241
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:41,528
Okay.

242
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,745
So are we done for today?

243
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:45,667
Let's go eat. I'll pay.

244
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:50,631
What a shame.
Em and I have to work on the stage.

245
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,851
But I'm free and I like free food.

246
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,042
Let's go eat something nearby,
so you won't have to drive.

247
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:57,577
Sure, Pink.

248
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,132
You chose free food over your friends.

249
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,752
I'll go put my things away.

250
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,042
Sure. I'll wait outside.

251
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,555
- I'll go now. Good luck. Thank you.
- Bye.

252
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,776
Are you at 'takraw' practice?

253
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,403
You won't reply my text
or pick up my calls.

254
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:28,106
(Sherbet)

255
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:45,586
Sher.

256
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:48,314
- We're leaving now. See you.
- See you.

257
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:08,787
Are you tired, Prince?

258
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:10,419
I'll go see you there.

259
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,611
Is everything okay, Fahlan?

260
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,044
If you're not free,
we can do this next time.

261
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:35,490
I'm fine.

262
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:39,505
Ping called and I didn't pick up.

263
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:41,795
Let's go.

264
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:43,685
Okay.

265
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:52,546
Sher.

266
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:53,953
Sher.

267
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,972
Well...

268
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:57,915
I'm not in your department.

269
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,065
But I know you from the Cute Boy page.

270
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:02,035
I see.

271
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,762
What is it? I need to go see my friend.

272
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,603
I...

273
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,481
Can I have your Line?

274
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,290
My friend likes you.

275
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:15,273
But he's too shy to ask.
He's afraid you'll reject him.

276
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:23,073
Why don't you try dating Fah?

277
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,979
No, I don't want a boyfriend.

278
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:29,473
You know that I'm not looking
for anything serious.

279
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,039
I'm just having fun.

280
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,928
Being single is easy.

281
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:36,947
Sure.

282
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:47,816
Thank you.

283
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:50,826
My friend is Apo.

284
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:56,540
I'll go now.

285
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:34,133
Here.

286
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,378
Thanks, Gear.

287
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:38,634
Are you all right? Are you tired?

288
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,922
I'm not tired.
I just stood there to catch the ball.

289
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,242
It was fun. I got to work out.

290
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,074
You're sweating so much.

291
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,244
- Let me know if you're not okay.
- I'm fine.

292
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:01,409
Hey.

293
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,402
I told you to teach him about chairball,
not to wipe his sweat off.

294
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:10,904
I'll go sit down.

295
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,722
Hey.

296
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,412
Do you really like Prince?

297
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:19,917
I...

298
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,554
If you do, go after him.

299
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:28,648
Wait. But you and Prince...

300
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,083
Hey. Be brave.

301
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,060
So my best friend will get to date
a good guy like you.

302
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,387
Best friend?

303
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:43,729
I thought you were together.
You call him Wifey.

304
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,330
I'm just teasing him. It's fun.

305
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:51,088
People think we're together.

306
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:52,748
But they never asked us.

307
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,743
What about you?

308
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:57,659
Are you going to woo him?

309
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:01,225
If not, I'll take him
off the chairball team.

310
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,193
Yes, I will.

311
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:09,283
Then take him home.
I'm giving you a chance.

312
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,288
Where's Sher?

313
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,435
He said he was busy.

314
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,984
He asked me to take you home.

315
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,493
I see. Okay.

316
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:36,697
What is it? Why are you thinking of me?

317
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,916
I'm not free today.

318
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,313
I'm going to a bar.

319
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,370
Your story is all over the university.

320
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,818
You're making my life hectic.

321
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:51,634
I have to answer these questions
about whether you're dating Fahlan.

322
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:53,908
Because you slept on his lap.

323
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:56,332
Don't be too flirty, brother.

324
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:59,538
I'm your brother.
You're making me look bad.

325
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:02,458
Why don't you deny?

326
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:06,557
I tell people
that you are my father's bastard.

327
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:08,439
You're such an asshole.

328
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,384
If you start following Fahlan around
like a puppy,

329
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:19,558
I'll tell the whole world
that the playboy no longer exists.

330
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,651
So what is it?
You won't call me if everything's fine.

331
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:29,841
Sure. You'll get a piece of me.

332
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:32,164
Don't say that I'm violent.

333
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:47,463
Fah.

334
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:51,284
I ate so much. My tummy is exploding.

335
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:53,433
I'm so full.

336
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,681
Eat more. I'll pay.

337
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,378
You want me to eat more?
Wasn't that enough?

338
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:07,138
I ate so much. If I eat more, I'll explode.
Look at my tummy, Fah.

339
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:10,163
I'm so full.

340
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,058
Sher.

341
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:17,123
But you even let him do your hair.

342
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,798
You slept on his lap.

343
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:21,985
You'll get hurt playing
with other people's feelings.

344
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:28,039
I'll be right back, Pink.

345
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,458
What's wrong with you, Sher?

346
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,147
You won't pick up my calls or read my text.

347
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,192
You're avoiding me.

348
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:45,372
I'm fine.

349
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:48,258
- Go back to your friend.
- That's Pink.

350
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,441
I'm in the play with her.
I don't have feelings for her.

351
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,651
I asked her to eat with me.

352
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,729
Because I'm killing time
waiting to pick you up.

353
00:23:57,162 --> 00:23:59,811
If you start following Fahlan around
like a puppy,

354
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:05,242
I'll tell the whole world
that the playboy no longer exists.

355
00:24:06,774 --> 00:24:08,985
You don't have to explain about her to me.

356
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,339
We are just friends, Fah.

357
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:16,537
What the hell is wrong with you?

358
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,077
Tell me why you're mad.

359
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:22,483
I'm not mad at you.

360
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:25,620
I just think you're crossing the line.

361
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:31,133
- Your guitar is at my house.
- Return it to me tomorrow.

362
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,114
I'll give your clothes back.

363
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:44,384
This thing between us... Let's end it now.

364
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:35,690
Are you and Sherbet close?

365
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:38,994
I don't see him close to anyone.

366
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,444
We were in the same class once.
He barely talked to me.

367
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:48,649
That means what the Cute Boy page
is claiming is true, isn't it?

368
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,112
It's an exaggeration.

369
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,497
We are just friends.

370
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,189
Is this why he's upset?

371
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:07,665
Fah.

372
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:09,379
Fah.

373
00:26:10,488 --> 00:26:12,801
- Fah. Shall we go?
- Yes?

374
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:14,962
Sure.

375
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,597
Here. Take it.

376
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:04,628
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

377
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:23,081
You want to keep
a fuck buddy and your private life apart.

378
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:27,258
Does "private life" mean boyfriend?

379
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:31,402
If so,

380
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,395
I can be just a friend.

381
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,560
Friends don't sleep with each other.

382
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,509
Your logic is fucked up.

383
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:39,956
Friends with benefits.

384
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,013
Friends who fuck.

385
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:18,886
Damn it.

386
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,267
Stop calling me.

387
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:07,984
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

388
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:18,873
Do you also think
that he's serious this time?

389
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,337
You saw him.

390
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:26,233
He never does this with anyone.

391
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:28,010
Think about it.

392
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:30,274
When he has a new boy,

393
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:32,018
the boy follows him around.

394
00:30:32,486 --> 00:30:34,978
Sher is the only one he's following.

395
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:40,675
But I'm worried about him.

396
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,764
Fah and Sher are so alike.

397
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,915
They're both easily bored.

398
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:47,537
They're both playboys.

399
00:30:48,465 --> 00:30:49,973
There are so many comments on the page.

400
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:54,337
Being worried is useless.

401
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:57,938
As friends, we can only console him
when he's hurt.

402
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:00,907
What about you?

403
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:03,011
You said you like someone.

404
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:04,364
Which department?

405
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:06,234
You never told me.

406
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:12,762
Who is the girl who made you fall in love?

407
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:15,593
I've been in love with her for a long time.

408
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:20,481
But as a friend, you only need
to console me when I'm hurt.

409
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:23,378
Damn it, Ping. Don't mock me.

410
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,291
Yes, Namwan?

411
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:34,458
Tonight?

412
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:36,367
Sure.

413
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,079
I'll see you there.

414
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,041
I'm coming home late tonight.

415
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:44,552
I have a date.

416
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:46,506
Okay.

417
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:48,385
Take the key.

418
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:50,464
I don't want to get up and let you in.

419
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,170
You have to come with me.

420
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:55,112
Go with her.

421
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,993
I want to sleep. Why take me with you?

422
00:31:58,466 --> 00:31:59,810
Hey, Ping.

423
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:02,498
Come with me.

424
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,225
Ping.

425
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:09,538
Don't let me go alone, Ping.

426
00:32:35,516 --> 00:32:36,251
Sher.

427
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,260
Where are you?

428
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:40,865
- Hey, Pink.
- What?

429
00:32:41,715 --> 00:32:42,754
Isn't that Fahlan?

430
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:47,018
You're right.

431
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:48,690
Why is he lying here?

432
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,373
He must be stressed about something.

433
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,101
Did he fight with Sherbet today?

434
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:58,400
- Hey.
- What?

435
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,656
When Sherbet saw us
at the smoothie place today,

436
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:03,808
- he just walked out.
- He did?

437
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:06,216
- Fahlan ran after him.
- He did?

438
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:08,521
Yeah, but I didn't think much about it.

439
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:09,936
I didn't know what they talked about.

440
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,475
I said I was cheering for Sherbet.

441
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:14,137
But seeing him like this,

442
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,497
I think they got into a fight.

443
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:24,952
Did Sherbet think
Fahlan is going after you?

444
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,451
Probably not.

445
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:30,026
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

446
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:32,418
I have to explain to Sherbet.

447
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:33,945
Where are you going?

448
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,688
- Do you know where Sherbet is?
- Korb-Lok Music Bar.

449
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:39,393
You won't see him.
He's not performing there tonight.

450
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,570
Damn it.

451
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,960
Am I the reason they're misunderstanding?

452
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:49,799
Come here.

453
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:55,392
Am I really going to let it end like this?

454
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,524
What's the matter?

455
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:23,171
You've been busy.

456
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,472
It's already 7 p.m.

457
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:28,170
Go change.
You finished showering before I did.

458
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:31,082
It's Fah.

459
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:32,812
He's been unusually quiet.

460
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,194
He won't reply my text.

461
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:35,483
He won't pick up.

462
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:38,834
He's probably with Sher.

463
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,733
Why are you bothering him?

464
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:45,129
I want him to come with us.

465
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:46,931
You're going on a date.

466
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:49,389
You're dragging me there
to watch you flirt with some girl.

467
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,065
Do you think I'll be having fun, Tap?

468
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,713
Ping.

469
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,233
I asked you to come
because I don't want to be alone with her.

470
00:34:56,404 --> 00:34:57,764
I want you to come with me.

471
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:00,563
I don't know what to talk to her about.

472
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:03,956
Also,

473
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,264
I feel safer if you would come.

474
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:13,562
Fine, I'll go.

475
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,381
Tar, what are you doing?

476
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:47,000
Tar, what were you doing?
I can't take it anymore.

477
00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:51,849
I'm scared that Sherbet will think
that Fahlan likes me.

478
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:54,122
Hold on, Pink. Calm down.

479
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:58,505
You've always believed
that Fahlan and Sherbet like each other.

480
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,479
Yes, that's why I'm worried.

481
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:03,718
I don't want them to break up.

482
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:05,785
Listen to me.

483
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:10,849
If Fahlan and Sherbet like each other
like you expect,

484
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:12,725
a woman like you

485
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:16,305
can't be the reason for their fight, right?

486
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,742
But...

487
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:24,708
I think Sherbet knows
that Fahlan doesn't like you

488
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,135
and he's not going after you.

489
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,187
You're right.

490
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:30,041
What was I thinking?

491
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:33,004
What were they fighting about then?

492
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,063
Will they make up?

(Korb-Lok Music Bar)

494
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:49,985
I'm sorry for being late, Tap and Ping.

495
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,706
The traffic was so bad.

496
00:36:52,348 --> 00:36:54,481
It's fine. We just got here as well.

497
00:36:55,887 --> 00:36:58,785
I need to use the bathroom. Where is it?

498
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:00,491
I'll go with you.

499
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,004
It's fine.

500
00:37:13,926 --> 00:37:15,426
We just here as well.

501
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:16,575
Yeah, right.

502
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,388
The bar is ten minutes from the dorm.

503
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:21,852
Why did we come here before it even opened?

504
00:38:23,078 --> 00:38:24,500
Yes, I just got done
with basketball practice.

505
00:38:25,628 --> 00:38:27,667
What's the matter with you?
You keep calling me.

506
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,397
Fahlan.

507
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:31,259
I met Sher at Korb-Lok Music Bar.

508
00:38:32,915 --> 00:38:33,938
He looks wasted.

509
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,001
(Next Episode)
I can't stop thinking about you.

510
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:48,808
Stop saying you miss me
as an excuse to sleep with me, Fah.

511
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:51,961
Damn you. Leave me alone.

512
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,777
Tam, how could you do this?

513
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:58,534
What did you fight about?
Why did you punch him?

514
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,066
Don't pretend to care.

515
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:04,342
You just want to know
why I asked you to punch me.

516
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:08,929
Is he that important to you
for you to want to get hurt like this?

517
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:54,031
