(Previously)
I want you to think carefully.

13
00:01:16,964 --> 00:01:20,402
Who makes you happy?

14
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:22,038
Is this how you want to break up with me?

15
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:24,382
I'm just telling you how you feel.

16
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:27,911
Did you and Ping hook up?

17
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,117
Why am I so upset about Ping?

18
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,697
Don't be afraid to let someone in.

19
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:37,345
Open your heart.

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,111
Thank you, Prince.

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,329
For always supporting me.

22
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:43,047
What's the matter with you, Fah?

23
00:01:43,072 --> 00:01:45,997
If someone is in the wrong here, it's me.

24
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,673
For overthinking and acting ridiculous.

25
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:50,486
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:52,759
Can't I be the only one you kiss?

27
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:56,512
We're just friends with benefits.
What more do you want from me?

28
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,802
Some feelings...

29
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:17,278
Even though you're the one who feels it,
you can't really tell what it is.

30
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:20,911
What kind of response do you want?

31
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:25,269
What will stop you from overthinking
and overfeeling?

32
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,416
When your feeling says it's special,

33
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,048
but your brain reasons that it isn't,

34
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:35,843
what can make your brain and your heart

35
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:38,112
get along?

36

(The villain who lost at love)

37
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,592
Sleep in your place, Tap.

38
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:26,624
Why are you hugging me?

39
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:36,030
I saw you kiss Pai last night.

40
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:49,120
It's not like that. I...

41
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,689
See you at the cafeteria, Tap.

42
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:49,096
I'm sorry for kissing you last night.

43
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:52,650
That's all right. Luckily, it's just a kiss.

44
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,462
You probably missed Namwan too much.

45
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:56,994
I was thinking about you.

46
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,557
I did what my gut told me to do.

47
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,150
And why did you do it?

48
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,860
I just want to know if it's true

49
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,689
that the one I truly want to be with is you.

50
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:14,064
Are you sure that it's me?

51
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:26,608
Was that clear?

52
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,744
Hey, let's not go to class today.

53
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,041
What's wrong with Sher? Is he unwell?

54
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,188
He didn't even say hi to us.

55
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:05,836
Didn't you see?

56
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,743
His eyes are also swollen.

57
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,266
Maybe...

58
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,313
He had a fight with Fah?

59
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,257
Did you have a fight with Sher?

60
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,109
How do you know?

61
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,679
Tap and I saw him on our way here.

62
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:42,976
He's wearing a face mask as if he's sick.

63
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,843
But Tap said his eyes are also swollen
like he's been crying.

64
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,733
Sher, are you sick?

65
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,808
Sher, I'm sorry.

66
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,231
He doesn't read my messages.

67
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,028
You should call.

68
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,016
(Sherbet)

69
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:36,838
He won't pick up.

70
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,737
Keep calling until he picks up.

71
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,761
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected at the moment.

72
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,943
He turned off his phone.

73
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:05,209
Can you tell us what the fight was about?

74
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,076
I don't like it.

75
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:13,076
I can't get over the thing
between Sher and Prince.

76
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:17,724
Fah.

77
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,591
Do you really love Sher?
Or do you just not want to lose him?

78
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:25,866
If you just don't want to lose him,

79
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,100
don't do anything.

80
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,592
Leave it like this.

81
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:32,793
Tap.

82
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:35,918
You know I'm serious about him.

83
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,230
I'm past that point where it's just for the fun.

84
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,964
I really want him in my life.

85
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,066
Then why don't you go and talk to him?

86
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:49,714
Why are you still here for the rehearsal?

87
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,418
Maybe he's waiting for you.

88
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,112
And why can't he just come to me?

89
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:03,237
Why does it always have to be me
to go to him first?

90
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,628
There's a difference between trying
to win a fight and valuing the relationship.

91
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,284
And am I in the wrong here?

92
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,738
For wanting him to value me too?

93
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:16,269
Yeah, what's the meaning of love
if you have no value to the other party?

94
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:46,995
(Fahlan - Missed call.
Sher, are you sick? Sher, I'm sorry.)

95
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:50,542
Stop it, Fah. Stop trying.

96
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:54,922
Fah, are you sure you want it to end like this?

97
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:57,498
Is it really the time for you
to join the rehearsal?

98
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,810
It won't make you feel any better.

99
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,786
Then what do you want me to do?

100
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,435
Didn't you see?

101
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:05,740
I called.

102
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,717
It's Sher who wouldn't pick up.

103
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:11,646
Then you should go look for him.

104
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,021
You can come to the rehearsal later.

105
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,092
I can't be selfish like that, Tap.

106
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,013
This is my personal problem.

107
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:20,668
I need to keep it separated.

108
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:23,676
Aren't you afraid of losing him?

109
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,856
Do I get to choose here?

110
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:30,583
It's Sher who broke up with me.

111
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,278
You two are always like this.

112
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:38,778
You keep fighting with each other and sulking.
No one is willing to yield.

113
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,644
Sulking?
You made it sound like it's not a big deal.

114
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:45,915
Fah is really worried about Sher and Prince.

115
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:47,478
Yes.

116
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:49,087
And if it isn't like that,

117
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:50,993
why doesn't Sher say anything?

118
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,829
When someone feels hurt,
they don't usually tell the truth.

119
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,625
Even you don't tell the truth.

120
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,032
It's time to rehearse. I need to go.

121
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:20,035
Hey, Tam. Do you know Sher broke up with Fahlan?

122
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:22,644
I don't know why they fought.

123
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:26,067
But I heard Fahlan told his friends
that they broke up.

124
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,276
I called Sher but his phone is turned off.

125
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:30,457
Where are you? I'll go see you.

126
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:37,936
What happened, Tam?

127
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:39,678
You seem worried.

128
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,529
It's Sher. He broke up with Fahlan.

129
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:44,482
He ran away from love again

130
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:49,053
even though he really wants
someone good to love him.

131
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:53,368
Maybe he needs some time to change himself.

132
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:58,023
Just like you, I believe
this guy is important to Sher.

133
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,468
I hope he knows what he wants.

134
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:07,250
I want Sher to be happy like everyone else does.

135
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:09,530
I don't want him to be sad.

136
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:15,756
Oh. I forgot to tell Joke
that I'll take a leave off work.

137
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,342
He needs to find a substitute singer.

138
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,520
I need to take some time off.

139
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,857
Please find a substitute singer.

140
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,728
Hey, Tam.

141
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,119
You're so quick to hear the news.

142
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,531
Yes.

143
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,556
I was the one who broke up with him.

144
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,853
If you're calling to tell me to get back with Fah.

145
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,150
Don't even try.

146
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,377
I'm not siding with Fahlan.

147
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,470
I'm worried about you.

148
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,032
I don't want you to regret it.

149
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:02,237
I know that Fah is very important to you.

150
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,097
But he never trusts me, Tam.

151
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:07,393
He only listens to himself.

152
00:14:07,854 --> 00:14:10,706
He always believes
Prince and I are more than friends.

153
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:13,323
Do you think

154
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:16,245
love that started with paranoia

155
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,472
and without trust

156
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:21,752
can make us happy?

157
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,180
Yes.

158
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:26,962
I admit it.

159
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,147
I admit it, Tam.

160
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,874
He is important to me.

161
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,133
But no matter how important he is,
I need to cut him off.

162
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,954
I don't want love without trust like this.

163
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:51,576
What did he say?

164
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,530
He decided to end it because
it's better than to keep hurting.

165
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:59,187
Is it that big of a problem?

166
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,319
It probably is to him.

167
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:05,288
He lives his life believing that
loving someone is bad

168
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:08,085
even though that's not always the case.

169
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:14,273
Sher has always believed that
since our parents got divorced.

170
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,467
He thinks Mom not being with him
means she chose to leave him.

171
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:24,420
I feel bad for him. He grew up feeling like that.

172
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,483
It's Dad's fault.
He never admits that he made a mistake.

173
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,873
He ruined our family.

174
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,466
Since Sher was little, Dad kept telling him

175
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,198
all the bad things about relationship.

176
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,212
But the truth is

177
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:41,860
he was so workaholic that he didn't have time
and needed to break up with Mom.

178
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,191
And then he took Sher with him.

179
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,105
That's why he's afraid of being abandoned.

180
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:50,667
It must be very hard

181
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,113
to change such a deep-rooted belief.

182
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:59,315
But I think Fahlan can change Sher.

183
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,359
I can only hope that Fahlan won't just give up.

184
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,077
I want to see Sher happy for once.

185
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:11,288
Anyway,

186
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,046
Sher mentioned Prince on the phone.

187
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:16,540
Prince? Who is Prince?

188
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,454
What does that have to do with this?

189
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,196
I'll tell you later. It's a long story.

190
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:25,923
But I think, right now,

191
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:29,478
Fah needs to stop misunderstanding
about Sher and Prince.

192
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:37,454
Get out. And don't come back into my life.

193
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,243
From now on, you and I are nothing,

194
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:43,895
not even friends.

195
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:59,026
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected...

196
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,362
You are so mean, Sher.

197
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:08,480
Fah.

198
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,197
Why did you come so early today?

199
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,471
You still have half an hour before we start.

200
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,346
Oh.

201
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:20,235
I'm free and I don't really have anywhere to go.

202
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:37,091
Did something happen?

203
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:39,739
You don't look like you're okay.

204
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,700
Sherbet broke up with me, Pink.

205
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:49,810
How is that possible?

206
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,193
I never thought my chance would come so soon.

207
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:00,099
Do you think Fah will really break up with Sher?

208
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,138
If Fah is still sulking and not talking to Sher,

209
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,485
I think it's possible.

210
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,495
(Pai)

211
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:19,769
He's not picking up?

212
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:21,613
Try again.

213
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:23,605
Maybe Ping didn't hear it.

214
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,558
Stop it. I've called him four times today.

215
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,808
Is he sick?

216
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:33,511
He might have fallen asleep,
so he didn't hear the phone.

217
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:37,816
Nan, we are here on the street,
not in a lavender field.

218
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:39,855
Don't live in a fantasy world.

219
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,238
Ping didn't pick up because he's avoiding me.

220
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:47,878
I won't be clingy. It'll make me look bad.

221
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:51,808
Is that so? What if Ping ghosts you?

222
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:53,683
Then you're done for.

223
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,456
Why don't you pick up his call?

224
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,323
I know he's been calling you many times today.

225
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,761
I don't know what to say.

226
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,948
And I feel guilty.

227
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:11,511
At least, you should let him know your thoughts.

228
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:14,268
Or are you not sure about what I said?

229
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:15,300
That's not it.

230
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:19,496
I just can't believe that what happened was real.

231
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,042
I'm going to take a shower.

232
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:30,863
Hey, wait.

233
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:32,706
Let's talk first.

234
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:37,863
We can talk later. I...

235
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,027
You're my boyfriend now.

236
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,041
Are you sure, Tap?

237
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,822
It was in the heat of the moment.
It might not be what you really want.

238
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:51,789
Before, I wasn't sure.

239
00:19:53,945 --> 00:19:54,961
But now,

240
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,970
I understand what Namwan tried to tell me.

241
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:02,501
It's you who I want to be with.

242
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:08,686
Ping.

243
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:13,150
Some people have sex for physical pleasure.

244
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,134
But what I did with you

245
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:18,767
was from my heart.

246
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,204
It made me realize

247
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:25,040
who exactly is it that I want.

248
00:20:26,245 --> 00:20:28,995
It's true that, at first, I wanted to try
because I wanted to know.

249
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,643
But once I got to know, I became confident.

250
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,441
It's you.

251
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,586
Believe me.

252
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,266
Because I don't know why I should lie to myself.

253
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,195
Call and clear things up with him.

254
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,328
- Hurry up. I'm hungry.
- All right.

255
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:06,176
- Ping is calling me.
- What?

256
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,367
- Really?
- Yes.

257
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:10,504
Yes, Ping.

258
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:12,082
Hey, Pai.

259
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:16,645
Well, I... Well...

260
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:19,074
I...

261
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:22,332
Pai, this is Tap speaking.

262
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:25,318
Sorry I had to take the phone from Ping.

263
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:28,538
Well, I need to apologize about that night.

264
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,218
That...

265
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:33,943
my man confused you.

266
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,101
Ping feels so guilty
that he can't talk to you directly.

267
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,494
That's why I'm telling you now.

268
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,549
Let me apologize on his behalf again.

269
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,533
So? How was it?

270
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,229
What did he say?

271
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,025
- It's Tap.
- Huh?

272
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:54,736
He and Ping are together.

273
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:57,080
Huh? What?

274
00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,494
Tap and Ping are together?

275
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:04,908
Well, what should we do next?

276
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,322
Tap was very clear about it.

277
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,619
How could I continue talking to Ping?

278
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,856
I didn't expect you to be that clear.

279
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,529
If I'm slow, the dog will steal it.

280
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,373
I'm a person, not a bone.

281
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,233
Who said you're a bone?

282
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,006
You're dry dog food.

283
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:30,561
(MER'Y Cica Intense Serum)
Ahem. What are you doing?

284
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:34,100
Is this what the sponsor gave us?

285
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:35,154
Yeah.

286
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:40,240
MER'Y Cica Intense Serum for all skin types.

287
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:42,122
Their product is good.

288
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,294
It promotes clear skin
and helps with skin repairing.

289
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:49,804
It'll boost your confidence with clear,
smooth, and healthy skin.

290
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:52,756
- How do you know?
- It's the client's info.

291
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,006
Is that so, Mr. Anan?

292
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,036
Tar. My name is Anna.

293
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:01,216
Just wait for it.

294
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:07,107
Are you done preparing the clothes
for quick changing? We're about to start Act 2.

295
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:10,622
Yes, all is ready. I'm about to take it outside.

296
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:14,263
Pie.

297
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:16,646
I know what you're thinking.

298
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:21,216
You look decent enough.
Why don't you go after someone who isn't taken?

299
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,106
Taken?

300
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:25,825
Fahlan is taken?

301
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:28,672
Sex partners are not the same as boyfriends.

302
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:32,305
Fahlan doesn't like to be alone.
He'll need a sex partner soon.

303
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:34,297
Plus,

304
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:36,830
Fahlan and Sherbet broke up.

305
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,693
So I have every right

306
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:42,133
to pursue a relationship with him.

307
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:50,389
Huh?

308
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,718
Fahlan and Sherbet broke up?

309
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,757
No way. Why didn't I know?

310
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,240
Daeng.

311
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,670
Will your father believe me?

312
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:04,240
What the villagers say isn't true.

313
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:11,735
Okay. That's much better.
Let's take a break and come back in an hour.

314
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:13,297
Okay.

315
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,103
Fah, it's no use trying here.

316
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,015
Pink.

317
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,694
Sorry,

318
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,364
but someone wants to talk to Fahlan.

319
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:47,690
Prince.

320
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:13,628
I've just heard it from Tam
that you misunderstand Sher,

321
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:16,433
and think Sher and I are more than friends.

322
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:18,393
But really,

323
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,354
we've never been more than just good friends.

324
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,614
How can I believe you?

325
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,224
I saw it with my own eyes.

326
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:31,302
Sher kissed you the other day.

327
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,021
Plus,

328
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:35,216
I asked Sher.

329
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:37,876
He didn't deny it.

330
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,942
Fah.

331
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:42,139
Don't just make decisions
because of what you saw.

332
00:26:43,522 --> 00:26:46,663
I can assure you.

333
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:50,452
I never think of Sher as anything
more than a friend.

334
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:55,665
And more importantly, I have a boyfriend.

335
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:00,274
We've been together for a while.

336
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:03,055
Sher knows all about this.

337
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:05,649
The rest is up to you.

338
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,651
Will you let this take Sher away from you?

339
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:14,222
If you only listen to yourself,
you won't be able to trust Sherbet.

340
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,397
Someone saw Sher drinking there.

341
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:31,671
The photo is tagged
on the university's Cute Boy Page.

342
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:50,796
The phone is on.

343
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:15,163
Trust and promises...

344
00:28:17,757 --> 00:28:20,132
Those were never real, right, Fah?

345
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,676
May I sit with you, Sher?

346
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,216
Why are you sitting here all alone?

347
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:59,982
Or maybe you're continuing
what you did on the beach?

348
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:04,587
How do you know I've been to a beach?

349
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,317
You've got sand on your shirt.

350
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,360
How could I not know you've been to a beach?

351
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,570
If there were a lot of people
who pay attention to little details

352
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:20,812
like you, that'd be great.

353
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:22,828
I think it's adorable.

354
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:27,897
Actually, I was bored,

355
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,772
so I drove to the beach.

356
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,420
But the beach seemed too quiet,

357
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,655
so I looked for a nice place to come.

358
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:47,307
Luckily, you're here today, Apo.

359
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,978
At least I have someone to talk to now.

360
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:54,858
If nothing is bothering you,
you won't be sitting here looking so lonely.

361
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:56,366
Right?

362
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:03,226
Everyone knows that you and Fahlan broke up.

363
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:09,400
Someone who knows took a photo of you
and posted on the university's Cute Boy Page.

364
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:11,999
That's why you came to see me here?

365
00:30:12,546 --> 00:30:14,702
No, I came with my boyfriend.

366
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,968
I saw you here, so I came to talk to you.

367
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:24,413
I don't know why you and Fahlan fought.

368
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:29,444
But that night that you refused
to sleep with me and went home...

369
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:37,939
I know it's because
you didn't want to cheat on Fahlan.

370
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:41,226
Sher.

371
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,218
Not everyone can have sex with just anyone

372
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:48,944
if that someone doesn't make you feel right.

373
00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:58,029
And why do you think

374
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,190
the reason why I didn't
have sex with you that night

375
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:06,537
was because I didn't want to cheat on Fahlan?

376
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,788
Someone like you
doesn't usually care about anyone.

377
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:15,092
Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting here
with a long face because of him.

378
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:19,795
Ask yourself if this is really what you want.

379
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:35,628
Hello, Ping.

380
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,659
I'm going to find Sher
at the place in the pic you sent to me.

381
00:31:40,863 --> 00:31:43,355
Yeah, I know where it is.

382
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:50,177
Tap, I think we need to help Fah.

383
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,943
How are you going to do that?

384
00:31:57,535 --> 00:31:59,182
(MER'Y Cica Intense Serum)
(Perfect skin in one bottle)

385
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,357
You came right after you called.

386
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,076
What do you want, liquor or beer?

387
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:06,428
You have that stuff in your room now?

388
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:08,591
It's Charles's.

389
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,661
I never want to drink alone in my room.

390
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:17,184
So what do you want?

391
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,005
Whatever is fine with me.

392
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:21,271
Where is Charles?

393
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,631
He went out drinking with his friends.

394
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:30,254
Tell me the truth about everything that happened.

395
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:39,566
He doesn't believe me, Tam.

396
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:42,776
He doesn't believe that
Prince and I are just friends.

397
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:45,905
And I'm sick of fighting with him.

398
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:49,870
This is the main reason that makes you think

399
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:52,514
your relationship with him can't go on?

400
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,516
What reason do I need to come up with
to make him stay in my life?

401
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:02,347
You don't need to come up with any reason.

402
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:05,167
Love has its own reason.

403
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:07,728
It's not wrong to love yourself.

404
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,250
But you can't use your personal satisfaction
to judge love and make it the way you want.

405
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,508
You need to accept it and understand it.

406
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:24,094
And why do I need to put up with
something that makes me unhappy?

407
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:34,019
Because, in this world, no kinds of love
only bring happiness and zero pain.

408
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:40,180
What you've been longing for all your life...
Isn't that love?

409
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:46,763
Our parents separated
and that separated us as well.

410
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:51,582
I don't know what Dad told you about Mom

411
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,661
that makes you so afraid of love.

412
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,715
But I want to tell you that.

413
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,059
Mom still loves Dad

414
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:04,360
even though he doesn't
live up to her expectations.

415
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,889
I can't take this feeling anymore, Tam.

416
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:39,193
I know you love him.

417
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:42,091
And Fah loves you too.

418
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:45,802
You're mad at him because he doesn't trust you.

419
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:49,653
But have you done enough to gain his trust?

420
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:19,614
So, it's all in vain. Sher is gone.

421
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,363
How did that help Fah?

422
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:26,560
At least, Sher should know
that Fah came to find him.

423
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:34,724
I'll send this pic to the Cute Boy Page's admin.

424
00:35:39,497 --> 00:35:42,607
Hey, young boy, you're home.

425
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:46,718
Yes.

426
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:52,438
Thank you.

427
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,789
Sher.

428
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:12,873
Fah.

429
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:19,022
Sher, I'm sorry.

430
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:20,788
I'm sorry...

431
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:22,872
for not listening to you.

432
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,343
I only listened to myself.

433
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,022
I told you, Fah.

434
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:33,905
Don't come back here.

435
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:38,248
Your apology means nothing to me.

436
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:42,294
When I asked you to wait,
why did you make that promise

437
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:45,038
if you didn't intend to keep it?

438
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:48,957
Sher, please hear me out.

439
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:51,333
I know I'm in the wrong.

440
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:54,044
For judging and overthinking.

441
00:36:54,527 --> 00:36:56,348
But it's because I love you, Sher.

442
00:36:58,223 --> 00:36:59,371
I love you so much.

443
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,387
I don't want to lose you.

444
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:08,616
Can't you just give me one more chance?

445
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,879
I gave you one before.

446
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,012
But you didn't cherish it.

447
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:21,473
What more do you want from me?

448
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:23,892
Remember.

449
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:27,735
You can only be my sex partner.

450
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,313
Sher, wait. Sher!

451
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:49,284
No way. Fah wouldn't stay here until now.

452
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,511
No way.

453
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:02,432
I won't go soft.

454
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:14,674
What's up, Prince?

455
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:17,469
Huh? You're here?

456
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,974
If I hadn't called, you wouldn't have
answered the door, right?

457
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:32,318
Why? You think I'm Fah?

458
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,248
No. I just woke up.

459
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:38,045
Okay.

460
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,279
I met Fah at the university this morning.

461
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,678
He gave up.

462
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:44,561
You can relax now.
He won't be coming to see you anymore.

463
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,394
I've just realized that Fah can go this crazy
when he's heart-broken.

464
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,277
It's hot as hell,
but he wants to practice freaking tennis.

465
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,264
He said he needs to.

466
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,975
He made a promise to a professor
that he'll join a competition in Chiang Mai.

467
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,519
But in this weather?
Is it really the time to practice?

468
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:23,866
Just let him.

469
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,812
He probably wants to keep himself busy.

470
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:27,605
So he doesn't have time to overthink.

471
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:33,697
Damn. Stop it, Fah.

472
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:36,197
I'm melting here.

473
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:39,556
I don't have much time.
I need to go rehearse a play later.

474
00:40:39,852 --> 00:40:42,915
I know you got your heart broken.
Don't use practice as an excuse.

475
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:46,438
I don't want to play anymore. Let's stop here.

476
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:48,141
- I'm leaving.
- Fine.

477
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,261
Do you feel better?

478
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,964
I was already better this morning.

479
00:41:12,886 --> 00:41:14,675
Is it that easy to get over?

480
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:17,066
Didn't he say he really loved him?

481
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:20,300
Right. I agree with you.

482
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:24,894
Are you sure this is gonna work, Prince?

483
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:26,863
Won't Sher be mad at you?

484
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:28,746
We won't know if we don't try.

485
00:41:29,316 --> 00:41:32,355
If our friendship ends because of this, so be it.

486
00:41:33,183 --> 00:41:36,878
Damn. You can be so fierce, Prince.

487
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:39,691
It's you who changed me.

488
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:42,624
You made me know

489
00:41:42,648 --> 00:41:47,284
how happy it feels
to have someone I love by my side.

490
00:41:48,402 --> 00:41:50,093
That's why I want to help Fah.

491
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:54,010
I want Sher to be happy
with someone that he loves.

492
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,896
Did you eat?

493
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,177
Should I make some fried rice for you?

494
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,317
Stop it, Sher. Don't keep stalling for time.

495
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:06,192
Are you sure you want it to end like this?

496
00:42:07,388 --> 00:42:09,027
Did Fah ask you to help him?

497
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,068
No.

498
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,724
He asked me to help collect his stuff.

499
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:15,739
Okay.

500
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:17,622
I'll go get that for you.

501
00:42:23,692 --> 00:42:26,630
Now, I kinda feel bad for Sher.

502
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,332
Me too.

503
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:31,293
That's why I'm trying to help here.

504
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,958
The rest is up to him.

505
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,615
You wanna do this? Huh?

506
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:36,592
- Look at you.
- Come on.

507
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:49,837
Don't just laugh. Pull it there.

508
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,087
Make it tight.

509
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:53,556
Is this tight enough?

510
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:06,405
Rise and shine.

511
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:10,702
Wake up.

512
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,155
What about you? What name will you save mine with?

513
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:18,069
Do it now, so I can see.
I don't want you to lose my number.

514
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:44,227
I don't know what happened to our love.

515
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:47,044
I only know that I need to find my heart

516
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:48,883
where I lost it.

517
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:13,116
Fah.

518
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:21,764
The number you have dialed
cannot be reach at the moment...

519
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,710
Why did switch off your phone?

520
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:32,843
Physical wounds can heal in a few days.

521
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:37,101
But I don't know
if the wound inside my heart will ever heal.

522
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:39,359
(Fahlan at Rich Bar)

523
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:13,653
Sher.

524
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,333
(Next Episode)
Don't ever walk away from me like this again.

525
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,942
Can you stop trying to trick me
with those sweet words of yours?

526
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:31,388
What happened, Fah?

527
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:32,996
Sher is with someone else.

528
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:34,130
Come see this.

529
00:46:34,162 --> 00:46:35,376
In a relationship.

530
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,482
Did Fah post this to hurt Sher,
or is he really with someone else?

531
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:42,076
Fahlan must have posted this to hurt Sher.

532
00:46:42,248 --> 00:46:46,646
He's never been the one to get dumped,
so maybe he can do something really unexpected.

533
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:48,404
What about us?

534
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:51,568
When can we be happy like that?

535
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:37,148
