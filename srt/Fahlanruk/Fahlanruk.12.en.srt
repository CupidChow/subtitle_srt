What was your fight with Sher about?

13
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,468
I don't like it.

14
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,804
I can't get over the thing
between Sher and Prince.

15
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:22,140
If you only listen to yourself,

16
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,648
you won't be able to trust Sherbet.

17
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,202
Stop it, Fah. Stop trying.

18
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:29,257
Sherbet broke up with me, Pink.

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,640
I never thought my chance would come so soon.

20
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:36,280
I know I'm in the wrong.
But it's because I love you, Sher.

21
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:39,429
I gave you a chance, but you didn't cherish it.

22
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,592
Remember. You can only be my sex partner.

23
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,452
Fah asked me to help collect his stuff.

24
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,706
Are you sure this is gonna work, Prince?

25
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,749
Now, I kinda feel bad for Sher.

26
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,456
Me too.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,628
That's why I'm trying to help here.

28
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,218
I don't know what happened to our love.

29
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:02,229
I only know that I need to find my heart
where I lost it.

30
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,574
Fah.

31
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,510
(The man of love)

32
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,931
Sher.

33
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,884
Fah.

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,962
How come seeing your face
makes me forget everything that happened?

35
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,954
Come here. Come here to me, Sher.

36
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:35,000
Break out of that wall in your heart.

37
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,008
Believe in me, Sher.

38
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,305
I'm begging you.

39
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,367
Fah, I miss you so much.

40
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,360
Oh my.

41
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:47,344
Do you miss me?

42
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,141
- How are you?
- I've been looking for you.

43
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,508
Because I feel so freaking guilty
for being self-centered.

44
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:58,773
Is this how you're hurting?

45
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:01,362
How the fuck is this hurting?

46
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,745
Do you need to find someone
to soothe your pain like this?

47
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,145
Fuck you.

48
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:13,613
Sher.

49
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:20,203
Sher.

50
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,328
Don't walk away from me again.

51
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:33,094
Sher.

52
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,805
Why are you following me?

53
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:40,601
Go back and have fun with her.

54
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,149
Then keep posting about how you're hurting,

55
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,844
and how sad you feel. Like how you lied to me.

56
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:48,984
I've never lied to you, Sher.

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,223
There's nothing between me and Cartoon.

58
00:03:56,226 --> 00:04:00,718
And what I feel for you is really love.

59
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:08,242
Can you stop trying to trick me
with those sweet words of yours?

60
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,303
Ouch.

61
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:13,764
Sher.

62
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:19,517
Don't touch it.

63
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:21,283
Leave me alone.

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,127
I can take care of myself.

65
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,096
Stay still.

66
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,041
I'll help you clean the wound.

67
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:39,009
Be careful.

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,397
Ouch! It stings.

69
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,920
It's just a small wound.
Don't be such a crybaby.

70
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,771
You're not the one who got hurt.

71
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,943
Why did you throw away your shoes?

72
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,490
I was mad.

73
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:22,701
Everyone in my situation would feel the same.

74
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,637
Right.

75
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:28,310
It's normal to feel jealous
when your boyfriend is with someone else.

76
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,982
I'm not jealous. It's just annoying.

77
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,232
Since that day you chased me away,

78
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:52,278
I've been hoping that you'd come and take me back.

79
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,058
Even though it seemed impossible,

80
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,205
I still kept waiting.

81
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,285
And then, you came.

82
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,614
I thought I had lost you.

83
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,950
But I have hopes now.

84
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:19,848
I will never leave your heart again.

85
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:24,613
You've never disappeared from my heart.

86
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,934
Since the day we first met,

87
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,848
you've always been in my heart.

88
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:51,722
When I tell you to go away, just don't.

89
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,956
I almost lost you.

90
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,901
I'm not going anywhere ever again.

91
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,871
Anyway, are you okay?

92
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,129
I threw a shoe at you.

93
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:22,488
If it makes you stay with me,

94
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,011
I can take even more than that.

95
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,035
Don't put too much pressure on your foot,
or the wound will be inflamed.

96
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,244
Sher!

97
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,603
I know.

98
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:04,822
Don't forget to bring my car back tomorrow.

99
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,768
Okay, I won't forget.

100
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:11,284
Right now, you have to rest.

101
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:12,852
All right?

102
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,046
I'll make something for you to eat.

103
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,774
After that you can take some painkillers and rest.

104
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:49,220
Don't go anywhere again.

105
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,487
Damn it.

106
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,018
What's wrong? Why are you upset?

107
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:40,292
It's Fah. His phone has been
turned off since last night

108
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:42,018
I don't know if something happened to him.

109
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:43,784
He will be okay.

110
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:45,987
Maybe he doesn't want to talk to anyone.

111
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,409
I feel bad for him.

112
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,183
Maybe our plan doesn't work?

113
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,909
It's okay. We did our best, as his friends.

114
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,210
Should we hurry up and go to the uni?

115
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,139
We might find him at the tennis court.

116
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:07,423
Then... we should take a shower together.

117
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,077
Since we don't have much time.

118
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:13,132
Stop it. Don't get dirty so early in the morning.

119
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:17,647
Oh my. You're almost
a different person from the old Dumb Ping.

120
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:21,857
It's like you're my heart, or my wife.

121
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,577
You know me so well.

122
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,010
Are you coming or not?

123
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:24,420
I told you not to walk too much.

124
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,123
I thought you'd left.

125
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:29,091
I was going to find something to eat.

126
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:31,346
I didn't expect you to be cooking here.

127
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:34,433
How could I have left?

128
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:35,924
I want to be with you.

129
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:42,003
Here. I made it for you.
Eat, so you can take your medicine.

130
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,751
Feed me.

131
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:09,277
Sher.

132
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,089
Will you be my boyfriend?

133
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,490
Where is Fah now?

134
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:33,099
He checked in at a bar,
but he didn't post anything after that.

135
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,193
Maybe he got drunk and passed out.

136
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,263
I'm worried about him.

137
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,021
Should we go to his house?

138
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,825
I fear that he might get so depressed that...

139
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,052
That's nonsense.

140
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:49,591
You think too much, Ping.

141
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,146
Aren't you worried about him?

142
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:58,794
You see it too. This time isn't like
any other time that he broke up with his lovers.

143
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,222
He never got dumped,

144
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:06,417
so maybe he can do something really unexpected.

145
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,419
Tap!

146
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:45,263
What now?

147
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,458
Look at this.

148
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,740
In a relationship.

149
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:55,880
Did Fah post this to hurt Sher,
or is he really with someone else?

150
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:58,856
How could he be with someone else?

151
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,078
You know he's very serious about Sher.

152
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:04,310
This is good news.

153
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,918
Let's find something to eat.
We don't have to find Fah anymore.

154
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:09,981
I'm hungry.

155
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,868
Really? Why are you so sure?

156
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,345
Come on. Believe me, Dumb Ping.

157
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,055
Then why didn't Fah tag Sher in the post?

158
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,000
How about you? Why haven't you tagged me?

159
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:28,695
What?

160
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,851
And why don't you tag me yourself?

161
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,539
I've been waiting to accept it.

162
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:58,020
That's impossible.
Fahlan must have posted this to hurt Sher.

163
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:02,239
I'm one million percent sure it's true.

164
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,989
How do you know?

165
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:09,622
Maybe Fahlan did that to get Sherbet's attention.

166
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:13,022
If it's true, why didn't he
tag Sherbet in the post?

167
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:16,920
I know because I called and asked Fah.

168
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,522
It's true.

169
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,658
Well, maybe he's waiting to make a good entrance.

170
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:27,720
Fahlan has never posted
something like this with anyone.

171
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,311
If it's true, this post will be big news
for the Cute Boy Page.

172
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:44,913
Fah, can you stop carrying me around?

173
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,084
I can walk.

174
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:50,044
I won't let you.

175
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:52,251
You've agreed to be my boyfriend now.

176
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:55,299
I have to carry you into the bedroom.
It's a tradition.

177
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,385
Right, my boyfriend?

178
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,463
Enough. Stop saying that.

179
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,994
Why are you taking off your shirt?

180
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:17,322
Don't you need to go get my car
and go to the university?

181
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:19,712
I do.

182
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,306
But I have to finish
the bedding ceremony with you.

183
00:16:51,503 --> 00:16:52,519
Fah.

184
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,230
My foot still hurts.

185
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Then you need to lift your legs up high.

186
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,277
Fah.

187
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,042
Lift your legs up high.

188

(MER'Y Cica Intense Serum)

189
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,855
I'm happy for Fahlan.

190
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,558
Finally, he got back together with Sherbet.

191
00:17:56,683 --> 00:18:00,464
Yeah, Sher can be truly happy with love now.

192
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:08,450
(MER'Y Cica Intense Serum)

193
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:20,652
What about us?

194
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,918
When can we be happy like that?

195
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,929
Do you want to know so much that
you're waiting for me here in the parking lot?

196
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:48,547
Yes. At this point,
you need to give us all the details.

197
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,514
Can I just tell you how it ended?

198
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:53,960
Come on, man.

199
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,928
How did you make Sher agree to get back with you?

200
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,960
I want to keep you uncomfortable
not knowing the answer, Ping.

201
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:06,808
Damn it.

202
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,715
That annoying bastard.

203
00:20:18,556 --> 00:20:19,579
What?

204
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:23,134
Look. Everybody here is looking at him.

205
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,891
Why are you excited? They're not looking at you.

206
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:27,962
I'm not excited.

207
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,283
Look at Fah. He's smiling brightly.

208
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,079
He's a lost cause.

209
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:42,593
What the heck are you doing?

210
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,089
Are you making fun of Fah?

211
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:46,845
Nope.

212
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,508
I'm just happy.

213
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:52,618
Because I have a boyfriend.

214
00:20:56,811 --> 00:20:59,396
(Tam)

215
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,765
Hello?

216
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,570
Fahlan is being very obvious.

217
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:09,445
Why don't you add your relationship status too?

218
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,601
Fuck off.

219
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,937
Are you calling to annoy me?

220
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:16,828
Sorry. I don't have time to argue with you.

221
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:19,745
I was just asking.

222
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,534
It's no fun teasing you anyway.

223
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:25,960
You'll get so shy
and won't be able to argue with me.

224
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:28,605
All right. I won't bother you.

225
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:32,167
This morning, your dad called me.

226
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,649
He said it's been two days
and you haven't replied to his emails.

227
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,901
Go read your dad's emails.

228
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:38,596
Make him stop calling me.

229
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:41,307
He has my number.

230
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:42,799
Why didn't he call me, though?

231
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:47,776
Maybe... he wants to talk to his long-lost son.

232
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,987
All right. I'm gonna hang up now.

233
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,289
Are you really not telling us, Fah?

234
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:05,283
Fine. I'll tell you.

235
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:10,595
I didn't do anything unusual,
but it might be because of the photo you took.

236
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,220
Maybe that changed his mind.

237
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,355
Thank you both for that.

238
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,370
See? I told you my plan would work.

239
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:21,278
(Sherbet)

240
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,215
Hey, my love.

241
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:30,427
You miss me?

242
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:35,887
You want me to go now?

243
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:38,051
What's wrong, Sher?

244
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:39,722
I'm on my way.

245
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,422
Stop. Don't say a word.

246
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,711
I'll call you later.

247
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:48,305
Damn. He's the most whipped man of 2022.

248
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:53,282
Are you talking about him or yourself?

249
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:54,782
Him, of course.

250
00:22:57,992 --> 00:22:59,422
Maybe me too, just a little.

251
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:16,313
Where are you going? You can't park here.

252
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:18,968
I'll carry you outside to wait.

253
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:22,600
If you walk, your wound will hurt again.

254
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:26,233
No way. There are people here.

255
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,530
And I'm better now.

256
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:30,288
I'm worried about you.

257
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,881
I know you're worried about me.

258
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:36,990
But I'm not a child.

259
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:43,456
Earlier, you also hung up on me
before I could finish my sentence.

260
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:49,042
Just find a spot to park.
We shouldn't park here for long.

261
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,313
Thank you, Ms. Mile,
for sponsoring SB's music video.

262
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,959
It's his first.

263
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:28,820
It's my pleasure.
I've been supporting his work for a while.

264
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,652
Actually, he's on his way here.

265
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:31,825
- Okay.
- Right.

266
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,174
Maybe he can come say hi to you.

267
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:37,122
- Okay. I want to meet him too.
- Oh. Okay.

268
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:40,371
Yes.

269
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:43,873
Mr. Dunk, Sherbet is here.

270
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:45,413
Let him in.

271
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:47,976
Sherbet, come in.

272
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:05,110
- Hello, I'm Sherbet.
- Hello.

273
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,508
Sherbet, this is Ms. Mile.

274
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:07,375
Hello.

275
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,721
- Hello.
- She's the main sponsor for our MV.

276
00:25:09,746 --> 00:25:10,760
Thank you.

277
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:14,105
You can keep working. Please excuse me, then.

278
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:15,510
- All right, well.
- Okay.

279
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:19,329
- I'll update your secretary on everything later.
- Okay.

280
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:20,391
- All right.
- Okay.

281
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,607
Goodbye.

282
00:25:21,632 --> 00:25:22,678
Thank you.

283
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:23,710
Goodbye.

284
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:38,789
I'm sorry that I got hurt, Mr. Dunk.

285
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,211
I don't think I can promote the song right now.

286
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:43,376
It's okay. We still have time.

287
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:45,906
I've been thinking about it.

288
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:49,758
You have international fans too.

289
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:53,051
That's why I want you to revise it.

290
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:56,234
And change the lyrics to be
something more international.

291
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:58,333
I talked to your dad.

292
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,137
For this event, I want you to sing

293
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:05,036
as SB.

294
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:10,216
You want me to reveal that I'm SB?

295
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:13,841
You know I don't want people to know that I'm SB.

296
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,740
I think it's time, Sher.

297
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,353
You have your own uniqueness.

298
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:21,926
You don't need a pseudonym.

299
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,712
It's the best to be yourself.

300
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,029
I also think it's time.

301
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,311
You should try new things.

302
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,678
Okay, then.

303
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,545
I'll reveal that I'm SB.

304
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,483
But I need some time to fix the lyrics.

305
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,444
I need to work on a school project too.

306
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,365
No problem.

307
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,783
Actually, I want all the music video
and the song to be released

308
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:53,170
at the same time.

309
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:55,789
What do you mean?

310
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,844
I mean you should star in your own MV.

311
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:03,593
I don't think I'll be good at that.

312
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,007
But...

313
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,984
I think I have a male lead for you.

314
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,234
No, I won't.

315
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:16,437
I'm not doing it.

316
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:19,741
You can't say no, Mr. Fahlan.

317
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,139
Why can't I? I won't do it.

318
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:23,916
You need to.

319
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,287
Because I wrote this song for you.

320
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:31,080
All right, so let's do this.
Ple will contact you again about it.

321
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:32,373
- Thank you, Mr. Dunk.
- Thank you.

322
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:46,418
You shouldn't have lied
that you finished the song already.

323
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:50,559
I didn't lie. It's already done.

324
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:55,414
You're always with me.
When did you have time to write it?

325
00:27:58,429 --> 00:27:59,851
I wrote it before I met you.

326
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:04,702
But I didn't think
the story in the song could come true.

327
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:10,993
Thanks, Sher.

328
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:16,093
Please wait here for a moment, Mr. SB.

329
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:17,532
I'll go get the car.

330
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:20,329
You're annoying.

331
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:31,014
You're sure you don't wanna come with me?

332
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,093
I'll sit here and fix the lyrics.

333
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:34,687
It's hard, you know.

334
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,186
I'm worried about you.

335
00:28:37,827 --> 00:28:39,506
Your foot hasn't fully healed yet.

336
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:41,082
I can take care of myself.

337
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:44,590
You should go to the rehearsal.
The staff has been waiting for you.

338
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,858
Hi, Fah. Hi, Sherbet.

339
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:52,757
Hi.

340
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:57,851
Fah, we need to work a little harder this week
because we will start performing next week.

341
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,460
Okay, Pink.

342
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:04,623
But can I have some free time in the morning?

343
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:09,180
I need to practice tennis.
It's almost the day of the match.

344
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:10,711
No problem.

345
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,962
Let me borrow Fah for a while, okay?

346
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:16,610
Let's go.

347
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,337
How should I make this line popular?

348
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,765
Sherbet is waiting for Fahlan here?

349
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:33,476
You think I can't get between you two?

350
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:39,663
Hello.

351
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:42,187
Ning, send me Sherbet's Line ID.

352
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:44,858
Yeah.

353
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,558
Thanks. Bye.

354
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:55,491
If this plan doesn't work, I'll give up,

355
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:59,343
and stop trying to get your Fahlan, Sherbet.

356
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:01,050
Are you okay, Nak?

357
00:30:02,503 --> 00:30:03,761
Lately,

358
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,511
you've been crying alone.

359
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:11,386
It's the villagers.
They keep saying that I cheated on you.

360
00:30:11,902 --> 00:30:15,268
That I got pregnant with someone else,
and lie that it's your child.

361
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:20,439
My poor Nak.

362
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:24,189
Why don't you stop using social media?

363
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:29,603
Why would you hurt yourself
with the words of those who don't know you?

364
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,119
I'm afraid.

365
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:38,134
I'm afraid that you'll misunderstand me.

366
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:41,233
I know.

367
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:43,312
You will never cheat on me.

368
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:46,734
Come on. Let's take a selfie to show off to them.

369
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:00,758
After this, if anyone
says bad things about you again,

370
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,203
I'll take a photo of us and post it every day.

371
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:04,490
Is that good?

372
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:06,645
Yes, Mark.

373
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:14,117
I like it.

374
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,766
(Sherbet)
(See profile)

375
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:20,905
I'm sorry, Sher. Did it take too long?

376
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,748
I didn't expect it to be this long.

377
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:25,029
I'll go get the car.

378
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:27,270
Well... It's...

379
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:48,845
Hi, Sher! I'm Nat.

380
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:51,493
I want to get to know you,
so I'm texting you here.

381
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,925
Hi. Nice to meet you, Nat.

382
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:08,992
Sherbet is still the same Sherbet.
He doesn't really love anyone.

383
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:13,519
Let's take a shower.

384
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:20,933
If it weren't for you, I'd be too lazy to shower.

385
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:27,506
Hey! That's my house.

386
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,178
How do you know?

387
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:33,467
How could I not recognize my own house?

388
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:37,881
I thought your house is cool,

389
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:40,326
so I took it and added stuff on.

390
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:42,663
You won't sue me, right?

391
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,186
Why should I? My house is like your house.

392
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:50,779
Okay.

393
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,272
I'll take it...

394
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:56,045
as marital property, then.

395
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:07,273
It looks pretty good.

396
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:46,252
(Nat)

397
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,884
How are you, Sher? Are you lonely?

398
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,679
Just a little.

399
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:01,655
I'll support you from here. Keep going!

400
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,958
(Fahlan)

401
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:24,379
Fah.

402
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,581
Get up and have some porridge,
so you'll have some energy.

403
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,044
Feed me. I'm too tired.

404
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,966
Give me some pork.

405
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:15,513
(Nut)
I miss you.

406
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,124
Hey, Fah.

407
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:28,858
I'm done recording the song.

408
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:30,585
See you at the theater.

409
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:36,458
What happened, Fah?

410
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:38,811
Why did you have to drag me here?

411
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:41,225
Pie told me that...

412
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:43,397
Sher is talking to someone else.

413
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:45,577
They have been talking for a while.

414
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:49,334
That person is Pie's friend.

415
00:35:49,421 --> 00:35:50,632
Wait a second.

416
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,709
I think it's a misunderstanding.

417
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:56,452
From what I heard from Anna,
Pie doesn't have any close friends.

418
00:35:56,717 --> 00:35:58,124
He goes everywhere alone.

419
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,686
Lately, he's been spending
a lot of time with Anna too.

420
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,827
But if it's not Pie's friend,

421
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,725
how did he get the screenshot of those messages?

422
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,271
I think I know how to find out the truth.

423
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:14,553
Okay, Fah.

424
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:17,421
Okay.

425
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:19,193
I'll hang up now.

426
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,605
Nat, are you free?

427
00:36:27,222 --> 00:36:30,082
I'm lonely. Can you come, so we can talk?

428
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:34,868
Yes. But I can only be there for a while.

429
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:40,353
Sher.

430
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:47,341
Your name is not Nat.

431
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:50,840
I saw you with Fah's stage crew.

432
00:36:51,348 --> 00:36:54,485
I'm sorry that I had to use a fake name.

433
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,759
But I've secretly liked you for a long time.

434
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:01,556
I saw you with Fahlan, so I didn't have
the courage to go directly to you.

435
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,603
You know Fah and I are dating, right?

436
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,509
How dare you text me?

437
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:12,329
I just thought you're never serious about anyone.

438
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:15,657
We're happy while we're talking too, right?

439
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:18,024
You're a terrible liar.

440
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,048
I know you like Fahlan.

441
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:24,063
The reason why you did this was because
you wanted Fah and I to fight.

442
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:25,915
So that we will break up.

443
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:30,946
Fah told me everything
about how you approached him.

444
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:32,672
Impossible.

445
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:35,696
Fahlan would never told you that.

446
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:39,243
You and Fahlan are the same.

447
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:42,024
You got together just for fun.

448
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:46,813
I don't think you really know me.

449
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,313
Fah is not like anyone else.

450
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,908
If he's not important to me,

451
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:58,232
I wouldn't have done
all these things to make him stay.

452
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,401
What do you mean?

453
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:04,775
It means I trust Sher.
And I believe he isn't like what you said.

454
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,838
And Sher proved that to me.

455
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:10,068
Did you guys trick me?

456
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:12,127
It's not as terrible as what you did.

457
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:14,303
How is it not?

458
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:17,744
And Fahlan, how could you believe
that what Sherbet says is true?

459
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:20,401
Sher showed me the whole chat history.

460
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:24,737
From when you started using Nat
as your fake name and texting him.

461
00:38:25,643 --> 00:38:26,682
Don't worry, Sher.

462
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:29,237
Go with Pink's plan.

463
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,612
Just wait there. Pink and I will go see you.

464
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:37,549
You think you did this
and you can stay together forever?

465
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:40,674
There's no way. You'll break up soon.

466
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:49,407
Sher, what's wrong?

467
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:52,227
Why are you crying?

468
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:58,723
Thank you for trusting me.

469
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:03,199
Of course, we're together.

470
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:09,767
Pink.

471
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:11,931
What's wrong?

472
00:39:12,863 --> 00:39:16,996
I'm so happy that you and Sherbet
can completely understand each other now.

473
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,883
My ship has reached its destination.

474
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,825
Thank you so much, Pink.

475
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:30,903
You kept reminding me that we should always
talk things through if we love each other.

476
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,262
Thank you, Pink.

477
00:39:35,777 --> 00:39:36,824
Thanks, my junior.

478
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,199
Mark.

479
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:52,958
How will you live when I'm gone?

480
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:55,395
Don't worry about me.

481
00:39:56,419 --> 00:39:58,919
You should go practice meritorious acts
with the Venerable.

482
00:39:59,348 --> 00:40:00,981
Don't worry about anything.

483
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,450
I can take care of myself.

484
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,630
Mark.

485
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:11,481
If there's someone who can take care of you,

486
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,427
please open your heart to them

487
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,231
and let them take care of you.

488
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:21,145
I don't want you to be alone.

489
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:28,325
Nak.

490
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,106
Since that day we bumped into each other,

491
00:40:34,138 --> 00:40:35,247
my heart...

492
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,544
has no space for anyone else.

493
00:40:41,934 --> 00:40:43,169
I believe you.

494
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:48,114
I believe that there's no one else in your heart.

495
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:30,906
Thank you so much for supporting us.
We're so grateful.

496
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:32,565
It's my pleasure.

497
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:36,268
Next time, if you have another project,
tell me and I will give you my full support.

498
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:43,820
They're about to close the curtains.

499
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:48,679
It's your chance, Sher.

500
00:42:14,904 --> 00:42:17,834
I brought this rose for you.

501
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:20,985
Take good care of it.

502
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:22,821
This rose...

503
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:25,922
I will never lose it.

504
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:08,586
Since I moved to the US with my dad when I was 13,

505
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,009
I've always been alone at beaches.

506
00:43:13,446 --> 00:43:15,134
I'm so freaking happy today,

507
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,932
because you're here with me.

508
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:27,359
I'm very happy too.

509
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:30,382
So much that I don't want tomorrow to come.

510
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:36,123
I need to be in Chiang Mai for a week.

511
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:42,553
One week is very short.

512
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:47,314
Just close your eyes, and when you open them,
the one week will be gone.

513
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:52,587
Then close your eyes.

514
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:12,603
For love.

515
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:14,860
For Fahlan.

516
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,087
For me.

517
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,665
Yeah!

518
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,725
Are you tired, Fah?

519
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:43,382
My energy is boosted by hearing your voice.

520
00:44:44,702 --> 00:44:47,116
After I finish my match,
I'll head straight to you.

521
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,663
No. If they want to celebrate, let them.

522
00:44:54,702 --> 00:44:56,014
I'd rather celebrate with you.

523
00:44:58,819 --> 00:44:59,944
Do you miss me, Sher?

524
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:02,100
Of course, I miss you.

525
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:05,227
I wanted to go with you, but you wouldn't let me.

526
00:45:07,057 --> 00:45:08,400
I was worried about you.

527
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:10,720
I didn't want you to be alone while I played.

528
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:16,290
Plus, if you're here, I can't focus.

529
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:18,016
My attention would be on you.

530
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:22,141
Now that I know this,
I think I should have flown there.

531
00:45:23,712 --> 00:45:26,009
Fah, go to sleep now.

532
00:45:26,712 --> 00:45:28,219
You need energy to compete tomorrow.

533
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:29,876
I miss you.

534
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,431
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

535
00:45:34,188 --> 00:45:35,266
Bye.

536
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:36,946
Bye.

537
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,534
Miss you, Chiang Mai.

538
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:18,688
Miss you, Bangkok.

539
00:46:31,314 --> 00:46:32,330
Hi, everyone.

540
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:34,704
You guys came so fast.

541
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,462
Were you waiting for my live stream?

542
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:40,791
Gear.

543
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:47,627
Are you tired, Fah?

544
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:52,439
(Are you tired, Fah?)
I am. But I've finished one more match today.

545
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:56,481
I'm waiting to see your play.

546
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,120
(I'm waiting to see your play)
Oh, thank you.

547
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:01,763
Are you going to star in another play?

548
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:06,856
I'm not sure, but there'll be
more from me to come. Please stay tuned.

549
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:15,959
What are you doing, Tap?

550
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:26,344
(Nong Pink - Hi, Fah.)

551
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:28,261
Oh! Hi, Pink.

552
00:47:30,977 --> 00:47:32,875
Do you miss Bangkok, Fah?

553
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:37,919
Actually, I miss Sherbet.

554
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,847
I miss you too, Fah.

555
00:47:43,495 --> 00:47:45,378
Bottoms up.

556
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:14,821
Sher.

557
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:23,665
Close your eyes.

558
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:39,587
You came back sooner than I expected.

559
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:42,610
I've never been far away from your heart,

560
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,454
since I met you.

561
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:48,423
You have.

562
00:48:49,657 --> 00:48:51,266
You got out of my sight.

563
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,587
I almost lost you.

564
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:56,290
That's it.

565
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:59,266
That made me realize I can't go anywhere again.

566
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:03,789
And I don't want to go anywhere.

567
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:26,322
I'm right in front of you, Sher.

568
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,478
Can you see your reflection in my eyes?

569
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,503
There's only you, just like in my heart.

570
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:46,737
Your heart is pounding.

571
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:48,846
It's because of you.

572
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:51,722
You make my heart pound.

573
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:55,738
It has never done that for anyone.

574
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:16,786
