- Yeah?
- Does Fahlan have an early class today?

You sound excited. Are you a fan of his?

Hey.

What I'm about to tell you

37
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,857
is even spicier than the fact that
he's secretly dating someone younger

I'm not. My body aches.

00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:36,945
Okay then.

00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,007
Let's take a shower.

I'll take you back to your dorm.

I saw them with my own eyes.

66

Fahlan drove him back to his dorm.

67
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:51,078
I was stunned.

68
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,321
They were kissing each other goodbye.

69
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:56,344
Acting like a couple.

70
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,485
But it was just a one-night stand.

- What?
- Damn.

72
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,033
You know what? He was going like this.

73
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:06,260
Muah. Muah. Muah!

74
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,314
That's really what he did.

75
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:09,971
- What?
- What the hell?

76
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,886
What? What's wrong?

77
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:14,191
- I'm blushing.
- Me too.

78
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,755
Yes, I'm here.

79
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,700
Why are you calling me
every five minutes, Ping?

80
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,044
I'm hurrying.

81
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,891
It's been less than five minutes.
Why is he calling again?

82
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,653
Here. Take it.

83
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:25,741
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

84
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,842
Should I let him go just like that?

85
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:40,666
I've missed my shot.

86
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,238
Here goes.

87
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:18,543
If I keep flirting, he'll give in eventually.

88
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:21,543
I thought you were already at your university.

89

Why are you in the music room?

90
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:26,043
To put your guitar away?

91
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,004
Hurry up. You'll be late.

92
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:32,543
Oh dear.

93
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:34,067
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,520
Hey, Prince.

96
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,395
I thought I bumped into a stranger.

97
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,418
Where are you rushing off to?

98
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:43,699
You weren't even looking.

99
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,309
I'm going to class.

100
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:48,676
I'm glad to see you here.
I thought I was going to be late.

101
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:51,395
But...class is that way.

102
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:53,645
Oh, you're right.

103
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,434
I'm glad I ran into you first.

104
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,465
I would have gone the wrong way.

105
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,223
- Pink. Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,140
What's the matter with you, Tar?

107
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,836
You just ran into me. You deserve it.

108
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:50,578
Come on.

109
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,297
You didn't pick up.
I was looking for you everywhere.

110
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,726
I have news about Fahlan.

111
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:57,570
I should have just let it go.

112
00:09:58,593 --> 00:09:59,492
What is it?

113
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:01,148
What is it? What news?

114
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,609
Can't you worry about me first?
It still hurts.

115
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,406
It was nothing. Don't be a baby.

116
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,890
Are you going to tell me?
I have to print the edited script.

117
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,445
I have to hand it out to the actors.

118
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:12,593
Fine, I'll tell you.

119
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,226
It's about your crush, Fahlan,
who you begged to play the lead in your play.

120
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,343
Last night,

121
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,562
he brought a guy home.

122
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:22,476
Who was it? What's his name?

123
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,062
I don't know.

124
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,500
He's a friend of a friend

125
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,531
from a different university.

126
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:29,883
That's not interesting.

127
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:32,250
I expected it to be someone else.

128
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,323
Pink.

129
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,589
You know he's gay. Do you still like him?

130
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:49,722
Of course.

131
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,331
These rumors aren't new.

132
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,823
I heard about him because of these rumors.

133
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,042
Exactly.

134
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,277
How can you like him?

135
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,378
Because he likes both men and women.

136
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:05,519
Tar.

137
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:06,831
Have you ever liked someone

138
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:08,956
in a way where you don't want to own them?

139
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:12,167
If so, don't try to convince me
to stop liking him.

140
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,597
Damn it.

141
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:36,812
Hey.

142
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,187
What is it?

143
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,070
Why did you keep calling me to come here?

144
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,507
I was the one waiting for you.

145
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:57,788
You should be asking me, not Tap.

146
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:00,663
You just walked past me.

147
00:12:00,976 --> 00:12:02,195
You could have helped me.

148
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,179
It was you, Ping?

149
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:06,609
I thought it was a toad.

150
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:08,484
You're funny.

151
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:10,624
Toads aren't this cute.

152
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:12,829
So what is it?

153
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,156
You were calling me like I owe you money.

154
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,078
Give me 2,000 baht. You still owe me.

155
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,578
Fine, I'll stop joking around.

156
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:28,159
Where were you last night?

157
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:32,362
Your boy, Tle, called me so many times
I had to turn my notifications off.

158
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:33,322
What?

159
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,417
So why didn't you pick up?

160
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,823
Like I said, if he calls you,

161
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,999
tell him that I fell asleep
watching soccer in your room.

162
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:43,678
I picked up.

163
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:45,710
But I...

164
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,374
I accidentally told him

165
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,116
that I wasn't watching soccer.

166
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:50,655
- Dammit, Ping.
- Dammit, Ping.

167
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:54,593
Didn't he tell you to say
he was in your room watching soccer?

168
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,796
It's not that bad.

169
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,694
After that, I didn't pick up his calls.

170
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:01,030
- Dammit.
- Dammit.

171
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,171
You messed up by telling him
you weren't watching soccer. Idiot.

172
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:05,593
Really?

173
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:06,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

174
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:08,225
Hold on.

175
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:10,327
You don't have to be so upset.

176
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:12,132
This is about Fah, not you.

177
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:13,639
You're right.

178
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:16,553
Wait, what are you going to tell Tle?

179
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,593
I fell asleep at home.

180
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,608
I didn't go to Ping's room.

181
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,405
Are you sure?

182
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,131
Of course. Why so serious?

183
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:39,116
Hey, wait for me.

184
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:41,116
Tap.

185
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:48,202
He was carrying a guitar.

186
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,538
He might be in the music club.

187
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,857
I think he's acting strange.

188
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,622
I think so too.

189
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,724
Why are you in my way?

190
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:08,966
You're not worried about

191
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,888
Tle knowing that
you weren't at my place?

192
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,693
Like I said, it's no big deal.

193
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,403
You lied to him.

194
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:20,239
He found out.

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,653
Damn.

196
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:27,638
Like I said, it's no big deal.

197
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:28,950
Why are you guys taking it so seriously?

198
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:33,469
We know that it's nothing serious to you.

199
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:35,946
But what we want to know

200
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:37,180
is whether you have a new boy yet.

201
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,087
You were mumbling and distracted.

202
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:43,082
Oops.

203
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:47,558
No.

204
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:49,832
Don't take it so seriously.

205
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:51,519
As for Tle,

206
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:52,996
if I don't let him go,

207
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:54,566
he'll never leave me.

208
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:56,616
Got it?

209
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:06,248
Does he drink love potions before bed?

210
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:07,639
He's so confident.

211
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,165
Should I be worried about him

212
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,368
or happy for him?

213
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:19,033
You should just let it go
and stop being so nosy.

214
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:23,032
Don't forget that you're still guilty, Ping.

215
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:26,564
Fuck you.

216
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,595
That hurt.

217
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:50,364
Gear, you can say there.

218
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,786
- I'll sit somewhere else.
- It's okay.

219
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,162
This is your seat, Sher.

220
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,403
Go ahead.

221
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,123
Wow.

222
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:07,615
You're so charming, silly boo.

223
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,333
Every time I look away

224
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:14,107
- Someone approaches you.
- Don't be crazy, Sher.

225
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:16,435
Gear was just talking to me.

226
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:17,888
He has no feelings for me.

227
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,998
I can tell who has feelings for you.

228
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,037
Sher.

229
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,326
Come on.

230
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,928
Prince, did you bring food?

231
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:30,435
I'm hungry.

232
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,154
I haven't eaten anything at all.

233
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:35,490
I knew it.

234
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,763
Don't get so drunk next time.

235
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:41,341
Go home as soon as you're done performing
so you can get up early.

236
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,411
Okay, wifey.

237
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:50,841
A one-sided love

238
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:52,732
is like eating dry noodles.

239
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,537
It's difficult to swallow.

240
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:36,827
Hold on, Fah.

241
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,663
Where are you rushing off to?

242
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:39,733
Some business.

243
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,456
Huh? I thought
we were having hotpot together.

244
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:45,948
I have something to do.
Let's eat next time.

245
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:51,619
You think so too, right?

246
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,784
He's hiding something from us.

247
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:55,795
Tap.

248
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:58,521
Or he has a new boy?

249
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:02,123
Hold on.

250
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:03,342
Where are you going?

251
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,646
I have to find out who his new boy is.

252
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:06,990
Come on, Ping.

253
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,853
You don't need to try so hard. Fah will tell us.

254
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,502
He's never hidden anything from us.

255
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,290
Yeah, you're right.

256
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,658
He tells us everything.

257
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:21,485
Come on, let's go eat. I'm starving.

258
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,978
I haven't eaten anything
and it's your fault.

259
00:18:35,342 --> 00:18:36,568
Those two should break up already.

260
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:37,506
They're not a good couple.

261
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:54,197
Here.

262
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,945
It's been three years.

263
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,219
They're still gossiping about us.

264
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:20,648
It's been three years.
Are you still not used to it?

265
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:21,930
Of course not.

266
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,891
Your fans are even scarier now.

267
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,331
This is your fault.

268
00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:29,339
You like to call me wifey in public.

269
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:30,612
One day,

270
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,666
if I get murdered, you'll regret it.

271
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:35,800
You like to tease me.

272
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,518
You'll end up alone.

273
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:43,510
Who would dare touch my wifey and silly boo?

274
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,034
Silly boo again?

275
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:55,513
Hello.

276
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:56,708
Huh?

277
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:58,380
Changing the rehearsal venue?

278
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:00,841
Korb-lok Music Bar?

279
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,184
If I get drunk before the show,

280
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:05,544
don't blame it on me.

281
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:08,458
Fine, I'll see you.

282
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,617
Come pick up my guitar
from the music club with me.

283
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:15,766
Then we'll go to the library.

284
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,516
No, that building doesn't have an elevator.

285
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,813
I don't want to take the stairs.

286
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:21,789
I'll wait near the library.

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,206
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

288
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:48,396
Is it the one he was carrying this morning?

289
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,006
That's enough.

290
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:54,873
This is crazy.

291
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:56,662
I just met him this morning.

292
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:01,238
Can I help you?

293
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,848
Hey, Non.

294
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:09,473
Are you alone?

295
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,170
Yes.

296
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:14,888
Fah, who are you looking for?

297
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,084
No one.

298
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,248
I was just walking around.

299
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,263
The door was open, so I walked in
to see what club it was.

300
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:27,545
I have to go.

301
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:37,407
That's strange.

302
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,501
The club name is on the door.

303
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:43,329
Wait, is he here to find out about Tle?

304
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:49,582
Fah.

305
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:51,504
Tle.

306
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:54,012
Why do you look so stunned?

307
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:57,074
I...I'm not stunned.

308
00:21:57,808 --> 00:22:00,465
I was just surprised to see you here.

309
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,308
Are you here to meet someone?

310
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,179
(College of Music)

311
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,529
Prince is right.

312
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,716
Why didn't they choose
a building with an elevator?

313
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:22,283
I...

314
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,260
I was just around here.

315
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:26,330
I was thinking about something.

316
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:31,661
It's strange.

317
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:34,583
You called me so many times last night.

318
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:36,669
But today...

319
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:38,684
You haven't called me once.

320
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,137
You seem different.

321
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:44,114
Or...

322
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:48,821
Are you...dating someone else?

323
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:52,071
I...

324
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:55,501
I was just sulking.

325
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,040
I know you don't like it when I bother you.

326
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:03,087
But I can feel hurt, right?

327
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:22,015
If you're dating someone else, tell me.

328
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:23,851
And I'll leave.

329
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:26,453
Fah.

330
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,453
I'm not dating anyone else.

331
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:32,710
Don't be mad at me.

332
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:34,148
Please.

333
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:38,273
I won't sulk anymore, okay?

334
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:43,246
Fine, I won't be mad.

335
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:45,377
Don't do this again.

336
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:48,322
It makes me uncomfortable.

337
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,673
I won't.

338
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,676
Let's go eat something, okay?

339
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:18,049
Hey.

340
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:19,475
Sher.

341
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:21,186
You scared me.

342
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:22,280
Why?

343
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:23,545
I'm here to get my guitar.

344
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:25,178
- What's the matter with you?
- Hey.

345
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:29,342
Did you get caught messing
with someone's boo?

346
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,077
What are you talking about?

347
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:32,170
Come on.

348
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:58,529
Thank you.

349
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:01,006
There was a sudden change
of rehearsal venue.

350
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,803
Yes, come quickly.

351
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:17,338
So how many
freshmen and sophomores registered?

352
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:20,228
There are 20 freshmen
from the communications department.

353
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,150
And 18 already confirmed.

354
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:24,259
We have 15
from the architecture department.

355
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,158
And 10 have already confirmed.

356
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:27,595
(That Mark)
Here.

357
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,024
This is the script
approved by the professor.

358
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,289
Em, hand it out to the team.

359
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:36,359
Forget the old script.
There's been so many changes.

360
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,195
"That Mark?"

361
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:43,539
Why did they change the title?

362
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:46,531
"Ms. Nak Prakanong" was a great title.

363
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,593
That's because we'll be focusing on Mark.

364
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:56,795
Hey, Tar.

365
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,631
Hand the script out to the actors.

366
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:02,092
Why do you have two?

367
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:04,350
That's because

368
00:26:05,908 --> 00:26:09,353
I'm bringing the script
to Mark this evening.

369
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,751
That's okay. I'll do it.

370
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:13,564
So you don't have to wait.

371
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,891
It's okay.
I'll go watch Fahlan play tennis.

372
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:17,954
I'm going.

373
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,095
Come on, Pink.

374
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:22,001
You're so obvious.

375
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,743
Bye, guys.

376
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:29,782
This is for the costuming team.

377
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:33,157
Here, this is yours.

378
00:26:33,423 --> 00:26:35,829
Head of male costumes, Mr. Anan.

379
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,456
I-tim.

380
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:42,479
My name is Anna.

381
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:44,698
Get it right.

382
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,587
Isn't that Sherbet and Prince?

383
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:22,548
It is.

384
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:34,863
What is it, Gear?

385
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:36,480
- Sher said...
- Well...

386
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:38,464
I called him.

387
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:41,925
You're doing research at the library.

388
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:43,777
I have to go practice.

389
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:45,277
Who's going to help you, Prince?

390
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,793
You have to carry so many books.

391
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:50,894
I can do it on my own, Sher.

392
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,925
- You're bothering Gear.
- It's fine, Prince.

393
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,121
I'm willing to help.

394
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:56,714
I mean...

395
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,800
I have to go to the library too.

396
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:01,761
Then I'll leave him to you.

397
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,207
I have to go, wifey.

398
00:28:07,878 --> 00:28:09,948
What? They kissed!

399
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,636
Sherbet and Prince really are together?

400
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:16,620
No way.

401
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:19,347
No way. They're not a good match.

402
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:22,323
This can't be true.

403
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:24,191
Do you want to go now?

404
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:25,706
Wait, Gear.

405
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:28,261
Let me write down
what I need to research.

406
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,761
Of course, go ahead.

407
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:32,503
Let me know when you're ready.

408
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:34,097
I'll just wait here.

409
00:28:57,376 --> 00:28:59,704
We're done with classes today.
Are you going home?

410
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:04,129
Yeah, there's nothing to do here.

411
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:05,567
I should just go home and sleep.

412
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,176
Do you want to watch a movie?

413
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,418
I don't want to go home right now.

414
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,590
Sure. There's a new movie out, right?

415
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:16,973
Right.

416
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,903
Where's Fah?

417
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,965
It's not time for him to play tennis.

418
00:29:21,988 --> 00:29:24,356
The play rehearsal hasn't started.

419
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,949
- I'll call him.
- Hey.

420
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:29,395
Hold on, why are you calling him?

421
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,988
He's probably making up with his boy.

422
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:33,184
How do you know?

423
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,715
Did he tell you?

424
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:36,692
Why didn't he tell me?

425
00:29:37,454 --> 00:29:39,688
Why would he? He didn't tell me either.

426
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:42,845
Can you not be stupid for once?

427
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,322
You know what happened last night.

428
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:48,165
If he's gone, he's making up with his boy.

429
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:54,649
Or... do you have a crush on Fah?

430
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,688
That's why you want to know
everything about him.

431
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:58,266
- Right?
- You're crazy.

432
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:01,594
I just feel guilty
for getting him into trouble.

433
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:03,141
I don't have a crush on him.

434
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:06,548
I like someone else.

435
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:07,626
What?

436
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,391
Who is it? Why didn't you tell me?

437
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,196
I'm not telling you.

438
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,118
You told me not to be nosy.

439
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:17,790
Tell me. What's her major?

440
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,805
Hopefully it's not someone I like.

441
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:20,946
I'm not telling you.

442
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,040
Come on, Ping.

443
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,469
Tell me.

444
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:25,758
Ping.

445
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,537
Are you going now, Fah?

446
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:49,943
You said you would stay with me.

447
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,771
I forgot that
I'm playing tennis with a friend.

448
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,998
I have to go to his birthday party, too.

449
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:20,496
I'm sorry.

450
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:22,887
I just remembered.

451
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:25,645
Then...

452
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:28,934
Can I go out with my friend tonight?

453
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:31,265
Of course.

454
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:32,741
Why are you asking me?

455
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:35,163
You're always home. You should go out.

456
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:36,546
So you won't get bored.

457
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:39,702
And...

458
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,780
When can we go out?

459
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:46,997
I'll take you out sometime.

460
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:01,187
Thank you, Gear.

461
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,187
For helping me find the books
and taking me home.

462
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:05,625
It's fine, Prince. I'm happy to help.

463
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:09,258
Let's go to the back building.
I parked there.

464
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:10,062
Okay.

465
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:11,836
Prince.

466
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,875
I forgot that my car key was in my pocket.

467
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:16,765
Can you get it for me?

468
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:35,983
Wow.

469
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:40,639
You won again.

470
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,345
Even though you haven't
been practicing much,

471
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:48,243
you still won every round.

472
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:49,829
You're getting much better.

473
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:51,587
You're hitting much harder.

474
00:32:52,212 --> 00:32:52,821
Really, man?

475
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,446
Thank you so much.

476
00:32:55,978 --> 00:32:58,798
Let's do this again if you're free.

477
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:01,056
I feel like when I get to practice with you

478
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,493
It helps me play better.

479
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,345
Sure, let's do it when I'm free.

480
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,103
Okay, I'm going to shower.

481
00:33:08,282 --> 00:33:09,962
Look. She's waiting for you.

482
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:21,649
I'm sorry, Pink.

483
00:33:22,938 --> 00:33:25,258
This is my friend Tar.

484
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,039
Have you been waiting for long?

485
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:31,828
Not at all. You told me
you were playing tennis with a friend.

486
00:33:32,696 --> 00:33:33,203
Well...

487
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:36,390
Here's the script.
This is the final version. No more edits.

488
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:38,133
Okay.

489
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,644
When do rehearsals start?

490
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:45,418
I'll let you know.

491
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:47,340
Let me discuss it with the team.

492
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,746
Please excuse me. I have to shower.

493
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:53,004
See you.

494
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:54,496
Bye.

495
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:09,335
What's wrong, Tar?
You look grumpy.

496
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:11,241
It's hot.

497
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:12,976
No one asked you to come.

498
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:19,830
Doesn't she know
that I just want to be around her?

499
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:21,650
Pink.

500
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,885
(Korb-lok Music Bar)

501
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:53,570
Here. Take it.

502
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:56,695
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

503
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:06,440
Wow.

504
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,549
I knew Sher would come early.

505
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:12,333
He's not here to practice.
He's here to get drunk.

506
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,037
You guided me here.

507
00:35:15,716 --> 00:35:18,302
You chose not to rehearse
in the music room.

508
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,974
Joke bought me a new bass cabinet.

509
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:23,326
So I invited you guys here.

510
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:27,400
What was I thinking?

511
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:37,505
Fahlan.

512
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,271
We're going to Thonglor after.
Do you want to join?

513
00:35:40,786 --> 00:35:42,482
Go ahead. I have plans.

514
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:44,583
Okay, see you next time.

515
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,945
(Korb-lok Music Bar)

516
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:17,960
Fah.

517
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,358
You're so late.

518
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:25,147
I forgot we were going out.

519
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,100
So I had to go home and change.

520
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,842
You could have worn your tennis clothes.

521
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:33,658
Like I said, the bar isn't as fancy
as the ones you're a member of.

522
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:37,834
Here you go. Just for you, Fah.

523
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,819
A strong drink for you because you're late.

524
00:36:42,053 --> 00:36:43,546
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

525
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,491
- Drink up.
- Okay.

526
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,607
(Next Episode)
You're cute.

527
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:10,833
Don't you want to get to know
each other better?

528
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:16,099
I saw Fahlan kissing a guy last night
at the bar.

529
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:17,427
Who was it this time?

530
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:19,505
Sherbet, the architecture major.

531
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:23,822
So... how can I contact you?

532
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:26,384
Don't you realize
this is just a one-night stand?

533
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:28,048
Hey.

534
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:29,822
That's Sher.

535
00:37:30,368 --> 00:37:31,783
He's cuter in person.

536
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:32,978
His name is Sherbet?

537
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:36,853
All you can be is...his one-night stand.

538
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:38,798
My fuck buddy and my private life...

539
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,361
I want to keep them apart.

540
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,384
Does "private life" mean boyfriend?

541
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:44,314
If so,

542
00:37:45,486 --> 00:37:46,783
I can just be a friend.

543
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,095
Friends don't sleep with each other.

544
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,822
Friends with benefits.

545
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:51,962
Friends who fuck.
