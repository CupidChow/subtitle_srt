So, let's be friends.

13
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:19,115
Nice to meet you, friend with benefits.

14
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:23,084
Is Sher that great in bed?

15
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:25,311
Is that why you slept with him twice?

16
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:28,147
Do you guys think I'm in love with Sherbet?

17
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,123
Ask yourself.

18
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,365
If you love him, then keep going.

19
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:33,998
But if you're just looking for a fling,

20
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,092
I think you should back out.

21
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,248
You'll get hurt.

22
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:39,318
Damn it, Fah.

23
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:43,608
"I'm a kind person.
I hope he knows how I feel."

24
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:45,889
What if your boy Tle sees them?

25
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,717
Don't worry about me. I can handle it.

26
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:54,490
Everyone's so anxious to see
if Fahlan can win your heart.

27
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:57,849
Or has he won it already?

Even though there are reasons
to be afraid of hanging on to the love,

Tle.

34
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,064
I was afraid you couldn't escape
from Fah tonight.

35
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,148
When you said you could,

36
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:54,911
I was so happy.

37
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,258
What's wrong?

38
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:01,784
Did you have a fight with him?

39
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:06,289
I think you should break up with him.

40
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,649
Don't wait for him to do it.

41
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:13,673
Yeah.

42
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:17,023
- You can break up with me first.
- Fah.

43
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:21,784
How could you say that so casually?

44
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:27,098
You're saying this to break up with me,
so you can date Sherbet, isn't it?

45
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:30,136
You're here to see him, right?

46
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,625
This has nothing to do with him.

47
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:36,898
I don't want to be selfish anymore.

48
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,774
I know

49
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:43,128
that you two are secretly dating.

50
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,410
I was waiting for you to break up with me.

51
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:51,049
You knew? When did you start to know?

52
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:54,857
A few months now.

53
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,212
I'm not free, Ping.
I'll have dinner with Tle.

54
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,617
I don't want to leave yet.

55
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,704
I want to stay with you longer, Tle.

56
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,685
If you don't leave now, Fah will see you.

57
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,857
When are you going to break up with him?

58
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,240
We've been secretly dating for months.

59
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,209
Fah will not announce that he's dating you.

60
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:25,023
He's dating other people. You know that.

61
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:29,297
What I know are rumors.

62
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:32,769
No one has shown me evidence.

63
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,752
So what's the reason for me
to break up with him?

64
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,897
Do you want me to tell him
that we're secretly dating?

65
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:42,960
You should leave.

66
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,313
I'm not mad at you.

67
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,035
But I cheated on you.

68
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,410
He cheated on you too.

69
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,178
He went out with so many people.

70
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,133
You can't blame Tle.

71
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:10,456
You didn't want to get serious with him.

72
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,950
You're right. I won't deny it.

73
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:35,339
Don't feel bad about yourself.

74
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,339
I'm the one who's guilty.

75
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,219
I knew that you two were dating,

76
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:46,257
but I stood in the way.

77
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:57,249
Tle.

78
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:00,973
Do you really like Nont?

79
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,509
Yes, Fah.

80
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:09,433
I like him.

81
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:11,497
I really do.

82
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,184
Go date him. Why keep it a secret?

83
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:19,097
Wouldn't it be great
to break up with someone like me?

84
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:20,818
What about you?

85
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,108
Are you going to date Sherbet?

86
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,459
You know

87
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,081
that I won't settle.

88
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,165
Someday

89
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,056
I'll have to break up with everyone.

90
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,552
Please take care of Tle.

91
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,329
Yes, Fah.

92
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:20,848
I like him.

93
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,144
I really do.

94
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,761
Go date him. Why keep it a secret?

95
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,848
Wouldn't it be great
to break up with someone like me?

96
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:00,940
What's wrong?

97
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:04,873
Is this bar not as good as your fancy bars?

98
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:06,649
Is that why you're so distracted?

99
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,376
I'm fine.

100
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:14,024
I like this bar.

101
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,381
Because you're here.

102
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:22,481
If you're thinking about someone else
and want to go see him,

103
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:25,018
go ahead. I don't mind.

104
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:34,072
You're right. I'm thinking about someone.

105
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,411
But I feel good

106
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,961
that he gets to date someone
who also likes him back.

107
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:46,318
And...

108
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:48,717
I won't go see him.

109
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,081
I want to stay with you.

110
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,183
I have to perform after rehearsal.

111
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,074
I'm lazy and it hurts.

112
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,824
Here?

113
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:12,130
Don't bother. I was just complaining.

114
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,129
Why?

115
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:18,164
Are you embarrassed?

116
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:24,298
I'm not as thick-skinned as you.

117
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,018
Here are your drinks.

119
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,847
Are you all right, Sher?

120
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,247
I'm fine.

121
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,257
No matter how drunk I am,
I can get myself home.

122
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,545
Do you get this drunk
every time you perform?

123
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:48,263
It depends.

124
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,514
If I'm happy, I get super drunk.

125
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,874
If I'm unhappy,

126
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,557
I also get super drunk.

127
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:03,545
You're just finding an excuse to get drunk.

128
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,169
Today

129
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:11,786
you don't have to hire a driver
like the last time you went to my room.

130
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,192
No.

131
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,777
I'll get a cab.

132
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:20,492
Today.

133
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,025
I didn't drive here.

134
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:26,648
There's no need for a cab.

135
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:28,997
I'll take you home.

136
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:33,624
To your kinky room?

137
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,768
You have a hidden agenda. I know it.

138
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:41,546
Don't worry.

139
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:44,777
I swear

140
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:47,680
that I won't take you there tonight.

141
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:50,583
Come on.

I'm aware of what you just did.

144
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,851
I wasn't asleep. I'm just dizzy.

145
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:42,783
Okay.

146
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:55,315
Whose house is this?

147
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,315
My house.

148
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,698
Take me back immediately.

149
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,241
You said you didn't like my kinky room.

150
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:17,929
That doesn't mean
I want to come to your house.

151
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,058
Sleep here. I won't do anything.

152
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,137
I have an early class tomorrow.

153
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:31,833
I'll get you there on time. Please?

154
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,917
I don't have any clothes for tomorrow.

155
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,096
You can wear mine.

156
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:40,424
Please. Stay over.

157
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,384
- I...
- Please, Sher.

158
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:47,121
Sleep here tonight, okay?

159
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:10,513

00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:40,480
All done.

169
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,393
Tle changed his status.

170
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:54,831
That means

171
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,683
my dream is finally coming true.

172
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:20,872
What the hell is wrong with you, Ping?

173
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,025
You keep rolling over
and now I can't sleep.

174
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:25,632
I'm worried about Fah.

175
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:29,018
Do you think he'll be successful with Sher?

176
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,098
He went to see him at Korb-Lok Music Bar.

177
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,187
Ping, you're not worried about him.

178
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:37,864
You're just nosy.

179
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:41,528
Don't you dare call him now.

180
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:43,018
He'll scold you.

181
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,320
I can't sleep.

182
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,723
You have to. You'll find out tomorrow.

183
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:57,352
Tap.

184
00:16:58,829 --> 00:16:59,657
This is my room.

185
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,912
You're just staying over.

186
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,905
Then take good care of me.

187
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:09,498
I'm really sleepy now.

188
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,352
Is this really happening?

189
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,841
Yes, go to bed.

190
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:22,488
Damn it, Tap.

191
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,453
Your armpit is breaking my nose.

192
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:27,111
Good.

193
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:29,258
If you continue to roll over,

194
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,033
I'll use my armpit to suffocate you.

195
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,254
Hey. I have that too.

196
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:21,129
I love this band.

197
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:24,196
Oh.

198
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,649
It's not mine. It's my father's.

199
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:30,837
But he's not here anymore.

200
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:33,946
So I'm using it to decorate my house.

201
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:35,557
I think it's cool.

202
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:38,362
Oh.

203
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:40,151
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,218
I shouldn't have brought it up.

205
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:45,641
I'm making you sad.

206
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,904
I'm sorry about your father.

207
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:49,904
Hey.

208
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:51,818
He's not dead.

209
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:55,362
Fah.

210
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:58,034
You said it like he's dead

211
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,308
and letting you live here all alone.

212
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,727
That part is true.

213
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,753
My dad moved to the States.

214
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,146
He's never coming back.

215
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:11,411
He's a popular architect.

216
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:14,180
Everyone wants him.

217
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,227
But he gets paid most in the States.

218
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,425
So he decided to settle there.

219
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:21,323
Damn.

220
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,800
You should have told me that
in the first place.

221
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:45,962
Was he not good to you?

222
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:48,235
Is that why
you don't want to live with him?

223
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:53,552
He's great to me.

224
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:56,145
He supports and takes care of me.

225
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:57,985
He also spoils me.

226
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:01,804
But I chose to live here

227
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,764
because I like it here.

228
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,138
I get to be free.

229
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,731
And he's okay with it.

230
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:12,773
Don't you get lonely?

231
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:16,723
No, I'm used to it.

232
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:27,142
Why?

233
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:29,587
Why are you just asking about my dad?

234
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:32,338
Do you like him?

235
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,863
You deserve

236
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,231
to be left alone.

237
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:41,970
Your thoughts are dirty.

238
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,113
Come on. Let's take a shower and go to bed.

239
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,093
You'll be late for class tomorrow.

240
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:20,320
Your room is fucking neat.

241
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:24,041
Go take a shower.

242
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:25,846
The towel is in the bathroom.

243
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,550
Fine.

244
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:00,681
Damn.

245
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:02,991
Good, it's fading.

246
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:23,320
Even though your room is messy,
you smell really good.

247
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,626
It's this scent.

248
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,738
You didn't lock the door.

249
00:22:46,554 --> 00:22:47,601
You're flirting with me, aren't you?

250
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:52,507
Is sex the only thing on your mind?

251
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:55,562
Go away. I'm taking a shower.

252
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,578
Let's do it together. We'll save time.

253
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,721
Like I said, I won't do anything.

254
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,113
Up to you.

255
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:48,155
You seem like a strict person.

256
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,834
You have to dry your hair before bed.

257
00:24:53,845 --> 00:24:55,267
I don't like sleeping when it's wet.

258
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,649
Don't even think about it.

259
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,796
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

260
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:26,171
Come on.

261
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:28,891
I told you that I won't do anything.

262
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,930
I just wanted to say
that you also have to dry your hair.

263
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:35,592
You'll get sick.

264
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:42,082
Fine.

265
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:24,794
Aren't you going to ask

266
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:27,987
who I brought home?

267
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:31,295
No.

268
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:33,331
Why should I?

269
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,602
It's none of my business.

270
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,408
You are the first person

271
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,858
who I brought home to sleep in my bed.

272
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:55,553
I'm not as naive as your boys.

273
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:14,902
You're not like anyone else.

274
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,186
That's why I don't even try to lie to you.

275
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:53,711
Fah.

276
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:56,179
Don't you have a smaller shirt?

277
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,090
Do you think
I could wear something smaller?

278
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,602
Don't button all the way up.

279
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:08,699
It looks so suspicious.

280
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,149
This is your fault. You make my life hard.

281
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:19,962
Hey. Take me home.

282
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,769
I have to get my workout clothes.

283
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,730
I have 'takraw' and running practice.

284
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,818
A drunk like you play sports?

285
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:29,328
Fuck you, Fah.

286
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:32,011
I play basketball for my department.

287
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:36,073
I'm also on the basketball team.

288
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:37,824
I've never see you before.

289
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:41,220
Because you suck.

290
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:43,284
Your team has never competed with
the Architecture Department.

291
00:28:45,113 --> 00:28:47,480
You're not only drunk,
but you're bragful too.

292
00:28:49,465 --> 00:28:51,113
You don't need to go get workout clothes.

293
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,290
Take mine. They're in my car.

294
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:56,152
Fuck you, Fah.

295
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,883
You're huge.

296
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:01,321
When I jump,
my shorts will fall to the ground.

297
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:04,400
That's great.

298
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:09,672
So everyone will know
that your junk is tiny.

299
00:29:10,463 --> 00:29:11,487
Fuck you.

300
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:13,368
You think yours is big?

301
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:17,475
Mine is this big.

302
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:40,245
Thanks for waking up early to take me here

303
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:43,341
and lending me your big shirt.

304
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,858
I have an early class too.

305
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:50,530
Damn it. I thought it was your kindness.

306
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:53,459
It was.

307
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:56,729
But love is what I want to offer more.

308
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:00,167
You're cheesy.

309
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,164
What's wrong with me?

310
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,491
I'm sorry, Prince.

311
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:20,953
I didn't check my Line.

312
00:30:21,368 --> 00:30:23,305
- Since last night?
- Yeah.

313
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,542
I turned my notifications off.

314
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:27,969
If I hadn't called you,
I would have waited alone.

315
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,753
Good that you called.

316
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,578
Hurry up. Gear got us seats.

317
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:36,156
That damn professor.
He should have cancelled the class.

318
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,261
Why should we join another class?
This is so complicated.

319
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:41,675
Hey. You forgot, so stop complaining.

320
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:45,304
Come on. Why are you so mean today, Wifey?

321
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:49,794
Tle.

322
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:56,561
What is it, Pai?

323
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:58,314
Is it true

324
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:02,178
that you're dating Nont,
the Engineering major from the music club?

325
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,300
Yes, you heard correctly.

326
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,696
That means Fahlan is single.

327
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,233
I'm not entirely sure about that.

328
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,392
When we were dating,
he was also dating other people.

329
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:23,034
He'll choose someone and announce it.

330
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,253
But now he hasn't.

331
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:30,482
That means I still have hope.

332
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,653
(Tle dumped Fah and has a new boyfriend!)
The Cute Boy page's making this a big deal.

333
00:31:41,677 --> 00:31:42,613
Do you think Fah has seen this?

334
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,342
Ping.

335
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:46,801
He knows everything on this page from you.

336
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,346
Do you think he knows?

337
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,050
No way.

338
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:55,080
So I have to be the one to tell him.

339
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,287
Don't. I already know.

340
00:31:58,755 --> 00:31:59,568
- What?
- What?

341
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,017
You said he knows because I tell him.

342
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:08,667
Someone called Pai asked me
when I got here.

343
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,322
But I don't want to tell you now.

344
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,521
Fah.

345
00:32:15,652 --> 00:32:16,745
Tell me.

346
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,086
I couldn't sleep last night.

347
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:21,490
I wanted to know
if you were successful with Sher.

348
00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:25,001
How could you be so mean
and not tell me about Tle?

349
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,152
Class is starting soon.
Do you want me to scold you again?

350
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,067
Why are there so many people today?

351
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:40,883
I heard that
the Architecture majors are joining.

352
00:32:46,443 --> 00:32:49,849
Don't daydream. There are so many students
from the Architecture Department.

353
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,381
Your Sher won't be here by chance.
Stop daydreaming.

354
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,737
I don't want to see him.

355
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:57,592
I'm afraid I'll see him.

356
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,179
Really?

357
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,320
Look, it's Sher.

358
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,052
I thought you didn't want to see him.

359
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:14,267
You don't mean what you said.

360
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:16,761
Damn it, Ping. You're messing with me.

361
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:22,292
Prince, I'm here.

362
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,763
Prince, sit with Gear.

363
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,274
I'll sit somewhere else.

364
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:55,693
I want to nap.
I don't want the professor to see.

365
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:59,635
Up to you. Don't ask me to tutor you.

366
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:05,192
No way.

367
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,507
You can't be that mean to me.

368
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:09,150
Right?

369
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:12,829
What a coincidence.

370
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:15,484
But things are not going your way.

371
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,179
Or else you would be...

372
00:34:30,454 --> 00:34:32,954
What a coincidence.
I haven't seen you in awhile.

373
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:38,516
I gave you my workout clothes.
Why are you wearing this?

374
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:42,267
I forgot that I have a class.

375
00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:44,524
So I ran from another building.

376
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:50,666
Your hair is a mess. I'll help you.

377
00:35:01,037 --> 00:35:02,466
Are Sher and Fah that close?

378
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,682
- I didn't know.
- Right?

379
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:07,172
I didn't know they were this close.

380
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:14,867
Fah, I'm sleepy.

381
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,361
Take a nap then.

382
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,831
(Sher slept on Fahlan's lap.)

383
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:15,321
(Aww.)

384
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:23,784
Did you know that
Sher and Fah had the same class today?

385
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:25,779
Of course I do.

386
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:28,019
I'm about to upload a picture to the page.

387
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,911
Wow. You have so many sources.

388
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:34,488
When Tle posted that he is dating
an Engineering major last night,

389
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,142
you posted immediately
that Fahlan is single.

390
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,159
Do you see how many fans they have?

391
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:43,128
I posted it quite late,
but I got thousands of likes in minutes.

392
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:43,892
Wow.

393
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:46,816
Pink.

394
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:49,648
What you're doing now...

395
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:51,905
Do you think
it will make them fall in love?

396
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,833
Tar.

397
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:57,642
If you're a bit more observant, you'll see

398
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,809
that love happens naturally.

399
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:01,159
It has nothing to do with me.

400
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,938
I can't not post about something this big.

401
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:10,064
Aww, Fah's Sher.

402
00:37:10,214 --> 00:37:12,652
So cute.

403
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:17,051
That is it for today.

404
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,881
Don't forget to hand in your homework.

405
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:22,346
See you next week.

406
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:23,831
Goodbye.

407
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,406
Sher, wake up.

408
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,363
Class is over.

409
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,273
It's mine.

410
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:41,795
Thanks.

411
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,225
That looks familiar.

412
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:55,136
- What?
- The bag Sher is carrying.

413
00:37:56,462 --> 00:37:57,907
Yeah, it's mine.

414
00:37:58,146 --> 00:37:59,435
Huh? Why is it with...

415
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:03,650
What's the matter with you?

416
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,458
I don't think

417
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:10,537
we need to ask him if he was successful.

418
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:12,776
It's obvious.

419
00:38:14,613 --> 00:38:16,144
It's super obvious.

420
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,412
Sher and Prince.
I have to attend a meeting.

421
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:28,465
Gear.

422
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:31,268
You're the class president.
Can you sign Prince up for a sport?

423
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:33,051
So he can exercise.

424
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,331
No, I can't run that much.

425
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,531
I have asthma.

426
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,066
What about chairball?

427
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:40,066
You can be the goalie.
You won't be moving much.

428
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:41,902
- You won't get tired.
- Yeah.

429
00:38:42,172 --> 00:38:43,187
Good idea.

430
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,744
- Please take care of it.
- Hey, Sher.

431
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:48,249
- We're bothering you.
- It's fine, Prince.

432
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:49,683
I'm the captain.

433
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,233
I have to go.

434
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:53,787
- Okay.
- See you, Prince.

435
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:58,195
"I have to go, Prince."

436
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:01,177
I'm here too, but he only said it to you.

437
00:39:01,895 --> 00:39:04,551
How could you let him
hurt me like this, Silly Boo?

438
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,128
Don't mock me.

439
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:08,426
Do you know what you've done?

440
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,082
What? What did I do?

441
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,947
It's like I did something wrong,
but I'm not aware of it.

442
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,051
It's not wrong,
but you're probably not aware.

443
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:19,737
You've changed so much
ever since you met Fah.

444
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:22,258
When did you guys start dating?

445
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:24,611
Dating? We're not dating.

446
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,945
I'm still the same.
You're the only one for me.

447
00:39:28,343 --> 00:39:31,218
So stubborn. You even let him do your hair.

448
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,112
Is buttoning the shirt
all the way up a new trend?

449
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,372
It's hot. You've done it for many days now.

450
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:37,133
Hey.

451
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:39,012
Damn.

452
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:43,832
Sher, where are you going?

453
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:46,934
(So sweet. #Fah'sSher)

454
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:51,372
- Sher slept on Fahlan's lap.
- You're right. Let me see it.

455
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,674
Look at this.

456
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:58,289
- This is so good. I hope it's true.
- They're so cute. I can't take it.

457
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,770
Look, he's sleeping on his lap.

458
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,664
That's so cute.

459
00:40:02,689 --> 00:40:04,265
(So sweet. #Fah'sSher)

460
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,081
Look at this.

461
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:08,608
They're so cute.

462
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:14,216
Have you seen the picture
of Sherbet sleeping on Fah's lap?

463
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:16,447
Oh my God.

464
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,718
I saw it. Let me go to the bathroom first.

465
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:25,279
Fahlan, back off. Sherbet is mine.

466
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:36,935
Why are they smiling?

467
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,907
Or is it because my top is too big?

468
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:56,177
(Next Episode)
I think you're falling for him.

469
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,833
Yeah, I like him.

470
00:40:59,283 --> 00:41:01,651
Are you sure that it's really how you feel

471
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:05,772
and not just some excuse you use
because you want to keep him near you?

472
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,385
Date Fah? No way.

473
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:12,171
You're quiet, but you're funny.

474
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:15,340
I'm funny, but I can never seem to
make anyone fall for me.

475
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,429
Sher.

476
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,153
May I have your Line account?
My friend likes you.

477
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,873
But he's too shy to approach you.

478
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,000
Sher.

479
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,385
What the hell is wrong with you?

480
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:26,050
Tell me why you're mad.

481
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,049
I'm not mad at you.

482
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,192
I just think you're crossing the line.

483
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,418
This thing between us... Let's end it now.

484
