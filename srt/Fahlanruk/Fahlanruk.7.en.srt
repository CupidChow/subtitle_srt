(Previously)
What did you fight about?

13
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,626
Why did you punch him?

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,888
Actually Tam called asking me to punch him.

15
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,148
He wants to get attention from his boy.

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,997
Sher.

17
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,680
Is he that important

18
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:30,567
for you to get hurt like this?

19
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:32,520
I think he really likes you.

20
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,006
I want you to date him.

21
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:40,381
You'll not only be giving him a chance,
but you'll be giving yourself a chance too.

22
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:41,954
If you like him that badly,

23
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,141
go date him.

24
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,428
Stop trying to change the topic.

25
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,748
I know that you like him too.

26
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,418
Every relationship,
no matter what form it is,

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,423
has to be initiated by someone

28
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,072
for us to get to know each other better.

29
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:06,668
Someone has to lose part of their identity

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,496
to start a relationship
with someone they want to get close to.

31
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:13,395
Even though we cannot predict

32
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:15,506
if it will end fast

33
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,550
or last until the end of time,

34
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:23,490
it is a start for us to know

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,523
how much we want it.

36
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:30,161
We have to be brave to start.

37
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,217
I was going to call you.

38
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:40,419
Let's get some food. I'm hungry.

39
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:46,055
(It all started with a friendship.)

40
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,294
Why are you smiling?

41
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:53,714
Nothing.

42
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:57,109
If you don't tell me,

43
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:58,960
you know what I will do to you.

44
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:05,450
I was just amused
that you were trying to be emotional.

45
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:12,557
I'm glad that you felt like that.

46
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:22,555
Can I not eat?

47
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:24,621
You'll make me throw up.

48
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:28,548
Eat up.

49
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,053
You're hungry, right?

50
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,299
Do you like taking pictures of food
before eating?

51
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,113
Yeah.

52
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:52,950
I like taking pictures.

53
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:57,091
I often go on trips with my friends
to take pictures.

54
00:03:58,563 --> 00:03:59,453
This is the first time.

55
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:01,335
I want to take pictures of food.

56
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,637
Where should we sit, Tap?

57
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,698
Hey, Fah.

58
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,832
Why are you here?

59
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:28,806
I didn't know you would be here.

60
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,210
I was going to invite you.

61
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,193
But Tap told me not to
because you probably're not free.

62
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,784
I'm sorry for not inviting you.

63
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,180
But since we're all here,

64
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,741
let us sit with you.

65
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:45,667
You're an asshole.

66
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:48,968
Hello, Sher.

67
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,851
I'm Ping and this is Tap.

68
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,093
We're his best friends.

69
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:55,271
Okay.

70
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,813
I've seen you guys
when we had the class together.

71
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,748
There's no need for that.

72
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,181
You don't need to show respect.

73
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,898
Can we have the menu please?

74
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,763
Nice to meet you, Ping and Tap.

75
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,665
Please excuse me.

76
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,401
This wasn't my idea, Fah.

77
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,385
Ping dragged me here to follow you.

78
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,389
I believe Tap
that it wasn't his idea.

79
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,423
Ping.

80
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:46,521
You're lucky that I'm in a good mood.

81
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:53,563
You can call me nosy or whatever.

82
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:57,712
But I really want to be with you
when you're so happy.

83
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,172
Damn you.

84
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:04,012
You're going to make me cry.
You're more devoted than a volunteer.

85
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:09,935
Look at him.

86
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,674
He's so in love.

87
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,005
Look at him.

88
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,933
(Shabu w/ friends and my babe)

89
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,052
We've lost him.

90
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,079
- Wow.
- Unbelievable.

91
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,578
I wasn't talking about you, Sher.

92
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:28,031
I was just laughing
because Fah said he'll buy us drinks.

93
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,226
Should we go to Korb-Lok Music Bar?

94
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:33,137
You're performing tonight, right?

95
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,155
Let's have fun together.

96
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,741
Sure, we won't go home until we're drunk.

97
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:44,358
(Korb-Lok Music Bar)

98
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,051
I haven't had this fun in a long time.

99
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,363
- Yeah.
- You're right.

100
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,477
I don't want to go home.

101
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,170
We should stay longer.
We're just having fun.

102
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:13,110
I don't have any class tomorrow.

103
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,209
Let's go home. You're wasted, Sher.

104
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,985
I also have a tennis match tomorrow.

105
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:23,338
Okay, fine. Let's go.

106
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,989
Then I'll see you.

107
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:28,752
Hold on, Sher.

108
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,508
I'll take you home.

109
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,967
Hey. Take my car.

110
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:42,200
See you at the university.

111
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:53,453
Ping.

112
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:55,458
I'll take you home.

113
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,211
You're a pervert.

114
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,369
You're staying over at my place, right?

115
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,489
Now you've seen them.

116
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,035
Are you sure
you're still going after Fahlan?

117
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,678
Come on, Nan.

118
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:22,144
You know that Fah broke up with Tle.

119
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:26,384
Don't you think
he'll break up with Sher too?

120
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,469
I'm prettier than him.

121
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,918
(MER'Y - Beautiful skin in one bottle)

122
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,099
Sher.

123
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,275
Hello, Dad.

124
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:33,978
I told you that I'll send it over today.

125
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:37,603
I finished it a long time ago.

126
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,075
But I want to recheck
if there's anything to fix.

127
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:44,290
If not, I'll send it tonight.

128
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:47,214
Okay.

129
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:48,706
Bye, Dad.

130
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:37,027
I want you to date him.

131
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:43,003
You'll not only be giving him a chance,
but you'll be giving yourself a chance too.

132
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:50,666
Do I actually believe what Tam said?

133
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,719
We're just having fun.

134
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,124
Hey, Fah.

135
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,213
I thought you left.

136
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:10,226
What is this? You bought so many things.

137
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,698
Do you really live here?

138
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,666
You had no food in the fridge.

139
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,493
You ran out of juice,
but left the box in the fridge.

140
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:19,867
That's why I went to buy groceries.

141
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,565
Why did you buy fresh food?

142
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,346
Why didn't you buy ready-to-eat food?

143
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:26,990
I have a microwave.

144
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,708
I'll cook for you.

145
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:48,279
Here.

146
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:50,332
Drink this for your hangover.

147
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,379
Go take a shower after.

148
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:54,154
I'll cook for you.

149
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:58,392
I'll shower later.

150
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,147
I want to watch Chef Fah cooking.

151
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,938
You're going to watch me half naked?

152
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,117
Actually,

153
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,947
the kitchen will be a change in scenery.

154
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:19,165
Do you think I'm scared?

155
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,554
Fah.

156
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:31,355
Go cook.

157
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,341
Kiss my cheek.

158
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,085
Then I'll let go.

159
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:37,137
Come on.

160
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:41,093
Ouch.

161
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:42,802
Ouch.

162
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:46,338
Give me some emotional support.

163
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,889
Go cook.

164
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,584
If the food is good,

165
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:54,877
I'll reward you.

166
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,196
Just wait and see.

167
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,217
Wow.

168
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:57,530
It looks so good.

169
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,018
But will it taste good?

170
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,300
That's a different story.

171
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:05,043
Of course it will.

172
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,356
But... I taste much better.

173
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,881
Tap, wake up.

174
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,393
It's noon. Let's go out to eat.

175
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:28,369
Tap.

176
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:32,083
Tap.

177
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:38,968
Shit.

178
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:42,916
You're burning.

179
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:57,828
Are you all right?

180
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:00,492
What's wrong?

181
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:03,490
Do you want to go to the hospital?

182
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:05,953
Tap.

183
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,135
Are you okay?

184
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:08,721
I'll give you a wipe.

185
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,116
Are you all right?

186
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,432
Not really.

187
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:26,933
Are you sure you're not coming?

188
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:30,117
It's not that I don't want to go see you.

189
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,326
But I have work to do.

190
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,307
My father asked for it
since this morning.

191
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:38,083
That's why you looked stressed yesterday.

192
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,132
I'll hurry back after the match.

193
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:44,305
If you're hungry,
eat snacks and drink juice.

194
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,233
I'll come back to cook for you.

195
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,484
Did you get my car key?

196
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:03,573
I'm going now.

197
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:27,901
Your fever is better now.

198
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:29,915
Do you feel better, Tap?

199
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,970
Do you want to see a doctor?
I'll take you.

200
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:36,688
I'm fine.

201
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,860
I think I'll be better
after I rest a little more.

202
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:42,371
Thanks.

203
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:48,685
Are you going to finally admit
that you suck?

204
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:53,024
- You're always like this when you're drunk.
- Fine.

205
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,977
I admit that I suck.

206
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:13,243
Take some rest.
I'll get you some food and medicine.

207
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,230
Hello. Are you guys
at the university already?

208
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,618
Wait there. I'm leaving Sher's place.

209
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:47,978
No, I'm just calling to tell you
that I won't be going to your game.

210
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:50,109
Tap has a fever.

211
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,535
I'm out to get him medicine.

212
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,092
He'll be fine.

213
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:58,875
I gave him a wipe.
He'll get better after a rest.

214
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,005
Yeah.

215
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:03,598
Well, take good care of your boyfriend.

216
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:07,155
- I have to go drive.
- Fuck you, Fah.

217
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,329
What are you talking about?

218
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,581
He's not my boyfriend.

219
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:14,149
Damn you, Fah.

220
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:15,863
Hello, Fah.

221
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:19,691
He just hung up on me.

222
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:24,019
Or he knows?

223
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,932
I don't think I was obvious.

224
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,538
Honestly, Pai.
I think you should give up on Fahlan.

225
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:38,751
It's a waste of time.

226
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,419
Even if you get to date him,
he'll break up with you.

227
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,579
We haven't even dated.
How would you know

228
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,085
that he'll break up with me?

229
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:54,219
Come on. Sherbet is the most popular
in his department.

230
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,801
And you think they'll break up.

231
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:02,364
What if they date for a month
and break up like with Tle?

232
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,884
I think you won't even last a month.

233
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,339
This kind of thing
has nothing to do with looks.

234
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:10,932
Even if you look good,

235
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,175
the relationship can end
if you're not compatible.

236
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:14,781
And you, Nan.

237
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,293
You're my friend.
You're supposed to be on my side.

238
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:18,693
Give me some emotional support.

239
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,100
Fine.

240
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:26,739
So are you going to flirt with Fahlan
at the tennis court today?

241
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,796
Yes, of course.

242
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:34,731
What are you doing?

243
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,820
Hey, eat your food and medicine.

244
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:39,751
I'll go watch Fahlan play tennis.

245
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:44,058
What? Are you going to leave me alone?

246
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,306
Hey. You just have a fever.

247
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:48,214
I don't have to watch you.

248
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:53,108
Can you not go?
I'll feel comfortable if you're here.

249
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:58,383
Tap, dear.

250
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:01,955
Eat your food and medicine,
then go sleep.

251
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:06,316
You just have a fever.
You won't be dying soon.

252
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:09,235
Hey, I'm not a dog.

253
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,740
Okay, I'm going now.

254
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:14,539
If you don't feel better, just call me.

255
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,310
I'll call the ambulance.

256
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,721
- Come on.
- Stop it.

257
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:22,086
Do that to Namwan.

258
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:27,918
Eat your food.

259
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,443
I should find a place to sit around here

260
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,884
in case he needs to go to the hospital.
I'll be here in time.

261
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:11,185
(MER'Y)

262
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:12,626
Fahlan, fighting.

263
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:16,276
Girls nowadays are so fierce.

264
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:19,604
So fierce it makes me doubt
his sexuality.

265
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,171
Of course they have to be fierce.

266
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:24,084
Well, it's worth a shot, right?

267
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:27,003
If I get to date Fahlan,

268
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:30,354
I would be fierce as well.

269
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:34,760
- Fahlan, fighting.
- Fahlan.

270
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:36,894
Does Fah date girls as well?

271
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:50,150
Fighting, Fahlan.

272
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,026
Hey.

273
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,408
- Hold on. Look at that.
- Fah.

274
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,578
What the hell?

275
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,863
You're right. What's going on?

276
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,929
This guy's so ratchet.

277
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:28,090
He already broke up with Fahlan.

278
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,067
Why is he flirting with him?

279
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:36,188
I already knew
that you would have won this match.

280
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:39,467
- I'll be here for you in the next match.
- Tle.

281
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,810
- Is that Fah's ex?
- You don't have to do that.

282
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,141
That Engineering major
might misunderstand.

283
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:49,667
I broke up with him,
so that won't be a problem.

284
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:52,106
Okay.

285
00:26:58,845 --> 00:26:59,642
Sher.

286
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,769
You're here to support me, weren't you?
Why are you wearing a mask then?

287
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:10,163
Hey, you.

288
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:13,889
That's Sherbet.

289
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,379
You're right.

290
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,887
Sherbet's here for Fahlan.

291
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:21,282
- Cute Boy page was right.
- Yeah.

292
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:23,972
- I think it's true.
- How?

293
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:26,049
I think they're dating.

294
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:29,768
- They look so suitable.
- Yeah.

295
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:32,257
Aww.

296
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:36,828
I'm sad about this,
but I can't compete with Sherbet.

297
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:38,628
They're so cute.

298
00:27:39,078 --> 00:27:41,164
I love them both.

299
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,361
I was wearing a mask.

300
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:44,812
You recognized me.

301
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:50,923
I could remember your eyes
the first day I met you.

302
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,406
I rushed here
after I submitted my work.

303
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:00,875
I was too late for the match.

304
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:03,630
It's fine.

305
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:07,670
You gave me support
since we were home, so I won.

306
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,927
I'm hungry, Fah.

307
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:17,267
I think you should go home
and take a shower.

308
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:18,894
Then we can find something to eat.

309
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:20,706
If I have to wait until we're home

310
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:24,788
and wait for you to cook,
I'd starve to death.

311
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,740
Then let's eat now.
I can shower at home later.

312
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:30,347
Let's go.

313
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:39,554
Hey.

314
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,722
I think Sherbet is more ratchet
than Tle.

315
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,504
Are you sure you can handle him?

316
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:46,847
I haven't even started.

317
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,025
How do you know that I can't handle?

318
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,765
Awesome. Don't give up, Sherbet.

319
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:56,254
You're too invested.

320
00:28:57,384 --> 00:28:59,767
You'll soon see the power of the fans.

321
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:19,442
This picture will be the most popular
in the page this year.

322
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,208
Oh, my God.

323
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:22,924
So cute.

324
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,010
Wow.

325
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,373
Let's go. It's hot.

326
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:38,431
Let me go, Fah.

327
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,733
Your boy Tle won't follow us.

328
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,503
You always know what I'm thinking.

329
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:47,679
Do you know about me and Tle?

330
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:52,538
I didn't know that you were a fan.

331
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:54,445
Come on.

332
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,661
I heard people talking.

333
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,086
You're a player.

334
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,319
I admit that I was in the past.

335
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:06,683
But now you're the only one.

336
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,051
You don't have to stop.

337
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,731
I'm fine. We're friends with benefits.

338
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,403
That's right.

339
00:30:17,354 --> 00:30:18,636
But I just want to be with you.

340
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:22,668
Hey, Fah.

341
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,571
There's no point to be upset, Pai.

342
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:44,948
You know that they are dating.

343
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,091
I can't help it.

344
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:51,617
He seems quiet
and doesn't want to hang out with anyone.

345
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:53,844
I didn't think Sherbet was so ratchet.

346
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,378
You can still back out.

347
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:02,067
Sherbet walked in quietly.

348
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:04,635
Fahlan took his hand and walked out.

349
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:06,952
Think about it.

350
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,658
What if he didn't walk in quietly?

351
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:14,236
What would happen to you?
You spent a lot on your face.

352
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:19,408
I'm rich. I can afford a new face.

353
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:22,038
And I want to win.

354
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:26,702
Aren't you mad at Sher for bailing on you?

355
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,323
No, that's just how he is.

356
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,042
He doesn't want to watch
any movie he doesn't like.

357
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,986
He always falls asleep
when he watches a movie with me.

358
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,960
But if it's a movie he likes,
he will stare at the screen.

359
00:31:39,955 --> 00:31:42,143
You seem to understand him
more than anyone else.

360
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:44,318
Because we're so close.

361
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:47,951
We were barely apart
when we were freshmen.

362
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:50,946
He's a very good friend to me.

363
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:52,156
He always takes care of me.

364
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:55,944
So people gossip that we're dating.

365
00:31:56,896 --> 00:32:00,427
Sher isn't horrible.
Why don't you date him?

366
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:02,378
Because I don't like him like that.

367
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:04,529
We would never work out.

368
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,138
We are just best friends.

369
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:18,074
This fabric is for the loincloth.

370
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:20,872
This one is for the top.

371
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,125
This one looks better.

372
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:24,421
Okay.

373
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:25,910
Wow.

374
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,339
You're finally here, my paparazzi.

375
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:31,858
If you came a little later,
I'd have hung myself with these fabrics.

376
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:36,300
Good that you chose to hang
and not wrap yourself with these fabrics.

377
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,259
We don't have enough.

378
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:41,598
- Ouch.
- You're so mean.

379
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,306
Come, Anna. I'm ready. Let's start.

380
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,392
Okay.

381
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:49,133
I've finished all the costumes
except for the loincloth.

382
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:54,074
I think the traditional one looks better
than the ready-to-wear.

383
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:56,659
I agree. Let's do that.

384
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:57,850
Okay.

385
00:32:58,263 --> 00:33:02,098
The sponsors that have confirmed
include snack companies,

386
00:33:02,123 --> 00:33:05,191
fashion companies, skincare companies,

387
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:07,466
and makeup for the actors.

388
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:10,908
- And...
- Hold on, Em. I don't want to forget.

389
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:18,867
This is also work.

390
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,880
I see. Sure.

391
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,256
Okay, what did you say?

392
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:31,875
I was going to ask
if we're ready to do a fitting.

393
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,810
Let's wait until next week.
I want the stage to be ready.

394
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:37,505
I want pictures with the stage.

395
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,751
So we can use these pictures
to find new sponsors.

396
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,819
I'll tell the stage team to hurry up.

397
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:47,440
Alrighty.

398
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:49,567
- All right.
- All right.

399
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:55,553
That's it. Thank you.

400
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:01,521
I'm sorry, Prince.

401
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,627
I didn't mean it like that.

402
00:34:07,032 --> 00:34:10,266
If you didn't,
don't talk to me like that again.

403
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:14,088
If I liked Sher like that,
I would have dated him a long time ago.

404
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,033
I wouldn't be single all this time.

405
00:34:20,037 --> 00:34:20,920
Why are you smiling?

406
00:34:21,455 --> 00:34:22,127
Nothing.

407
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:24,723
Thanks, Prince.

408
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:26,508
Thanks for giving me a chance.

409
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,947
I'm also giving myself a chance.

410
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:37,805
Thank you.

411
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,992
Why are you laughing?

412
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:48,212
I think I know why Sher has been gone.

413
00:34:51,396 --> 00:34:54,716
Let me hold your hand.
I don't want us to be apart.

414
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:58,859
Are Sher and Fah really dating?

415
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,323
Honestly, Gear.

416
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:05,307
I don't know what Sher is thinking.

417
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:09,444
He's never dated anyone.

418
00:35:10,093 --> 00:35:12,483
But with Fahlan...

419
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:14,217
He seems more special.

420
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,479
More special than you?

421
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,612
Gear. I told you not
to talk to me like that.

422
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,146
I didn't mean it.

423
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:24,973
I don't know what it means
to be special to Sher.

424
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:27,503
I'm not that close to him, Prince.

425
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:31,464
I'm sorry.

426
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:36,411
Sher hasn't been like this with anyone
except for me.

427
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,203
Wow.

428
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:39,652
They're both players.

429
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:41,118
How would that turn out?

430
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,135
Yeah, I don't know.

431
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:47,876
We'll have to wait and see.

432
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,504
We just ate.
Why are you buying so many things?

433
00:36:41,473 --> 00:36:45,090
Your fridge is empty.
Do you think it'll run out of space?

434
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,913
You don't have to buy so much.

435
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:51,538
You went groceries shopping once
this morning.

436
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,314
What I bought this morning
will only last a few meals.

437
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:01,906
These things are for tonight.
So I can cook for you if you're hungry.

438
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,658
And I think you will be exhausted.

439
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,348
Pervert.

440
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,992
Tell me.

441
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,163
What do you think about

442
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,121
except for sex?

443
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,014
Hey, stop it.

444
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,153
Go.

445
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,771
Thanks for taking me home, Gear.

446
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,143
I had so much fun today.

447
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
Aren't you going to invite me in
for a cup of coffee?

448
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:11,005
I don't drink coffee.

449
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:12,632
Oh, no.

450
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:15,837
- What a shame.
- Don't be naughty.

451
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:18,280
Naughty? What are you thinking?

452
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,924
I wouldn't get the chance
to know your room number.

453
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:21,893
Really?

454
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,983
You suddenly sound like a nice man.

455
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:25,289
I'm going now.

456
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:35,524
I don't have any coffee in my room.

457
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:37,952
Do you want to come in
for a glass of water?

458
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,188
Hey.

459
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,730
It's already 7 p.m.

460
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,159
Tap hasn't eaten.

461
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:05,344
Fah.

462
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:12,795
Hello, Fah.

463
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:14,146
Did you win?

464
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:17,035
I knew you would win.

465
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:19,283
Tap?

466
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:21,674
He's better now.

467
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:24,466
Okay, I'll get him some food.

468
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:26,395
Bye.

469
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,403
I haven't swam in days.

470
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,707
It feels so good to swim again.

471
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,523
I normally swim three times a week.

472
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:57,877
Actually,

473
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:00,204
you should stay here.

474
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:03,311
You don't have to pack your things
to go to my place.

475
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:08,553
Of course not.

476
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,233
I bought so many things.

477
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:13,731
If I don't go,

478
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,657
they'll all go to waste.

479
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:17,620
You're exaggerating.

480
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:20,164
I cook sometimes.

481
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:21,483
You know how?

482
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:23,369
Your fridge was so empty.

483
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:31,627
Are you all right, Sher?

484
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,819
It seems like you don't want me
to go to your house.

485
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:40,483
If one day you don't want to go,

486
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:42,773
what will I do?

487
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:47,773
Did I do something
to make you uncomfortable?

488
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,723
It's not like that.

489
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:55,507
I know you like to swim.

490
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,953
My house doesn't have a pool.

491
00:40:59,613 --> 00:41:01,731
I don't own any workout equipment.

492
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:03,661
I'm afraid you'll get bored.

493
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:11,935
Being with you

494
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:14,360
won't make me bored.

495
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:17,474
Also,

496
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:20,587
there are many things
to do at your place.

497
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,807
I can do you.

498
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:27,173
Go shower.

499
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:29,203
I'm hungry.

500
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,259
What do you want to eat first?

501
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:35,808
Eat me?

502
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:40,785
Go take a shower.

503
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:42,832
Okay.

504
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,195
I'm scared of intimacy, Fah.

505
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:04,681
It might make you sick of me.

506
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:17,238
Hello, Sher. This is Apo.

507
00:42:19,024 --> 00:42:19,923
Apo?

508
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,132
(Next Episode)
It's ready to eat, Tap.

509
00:42:29,115 --> 00:42:29,647
Oh.

510
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,466
Namwan.

511
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,481
Why are Ping's things
separated to two sides?

512
00:42:36,769 --> 00:42:38,722
Fah, I'm hungry again.

513
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,036
You had two bowls of noodles
before coming home.

514
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:43,074
Or do you want to eat me?

515
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:45,426
You haven't had any dessert, have you?

516
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:46,661
Don't be obsessed.

517
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,113
After your match tomorrow,

518
00:42:49,557 --> 00:42:50,588
I'll give you some.

519
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,641
What's the matter with you, Tap?

520
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,193
I should be the one asking you.

521
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:56,939
Why did you lie to me?

522
00:42:57,415 --> 00:42:58,548
Why did you do that, Ping?

523
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,441
Are you all right?

524
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:03,806
Sher, did you break your leg?

525
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:06,565
What kind of friends kiss each other?

526
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:08,021
Soon enough, you guys will start fucking each other too, right?

527
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:10,770
If you can't handle it,

528
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:12,385
just don't.

529
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:59,148
