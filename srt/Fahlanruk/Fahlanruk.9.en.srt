who can find Ping when he goes missing.

13
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:21,962
- Tap.
- I'm sorry that Namwan came to your room.

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,915
I know that it's your private space.
You don't want anyone to come.

15
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:29,468
The only person
who I want there is you, Tap.

16
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,322
Sher, did you break your leg?

17
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,917
I just hurt my ankle.
I'll be better tomorrow.

18
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:39,923
You did that to Sher, but not me.

19
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,865
But if it makes you this uncomfortable,

20
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,444
I think we shouldn't start anything.

21
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,194
What kind of friends kisses?
So you'll fuck soon, right?

22
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:52,579
If we're fighting about small things,
how can we be happy?

23
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:57,164
But the small things you mentioned
might be big things to Fahlan.

24
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,376
In the journey of love,

25
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,787
no one knows what will happen.

26
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:07,155
It's a combination
of happiness and sadness.

27
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:10,723
We can't know
if we're going to be more happy or sad.

28
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:15,272
Even though sadness makes love painful,

29
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:20,378
we can't deny that we need it.

30
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:24,060
No matter what obstacle we face,

31
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:29,383
that's what we have to go through
to keep the love.

32

(The person when it's lonely)

33
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,901
We arrived quite late
and didn't take many pictures.

34
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:44,442
- Let's continue tomorrow.
- Okay.

35
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:49,386
Fah, thank you for choosing me.

36
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,956
When I saw your post,
I thought I was too late.

37
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:56,435
I should thank you for being my model.

38
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,522
It was so much fun.

39
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:04,101
If I came with a stranger,
I would be so nervous and quiet.

40
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,764
You prefer a talkative person
like me, right?

41
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,119
Your house here is beautiful.

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,251
You never post your house in Huahin.

43
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:17,422
I don't come here often,
so I don't post about it.

44
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,368
I thought you and Sher
would come here often.

45
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:26,071
Sher really likes the beach.
He posts pictures at the beach often.

46
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:31,167
Are you really a couple?
Why did you not bring him here?

47
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,785
Why do you think we're a couple?

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,245
The Cute Boy page says so all the time.

49
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,685
People are cheering for you guys.

50
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,733
That page is ridiculous.

51
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,425
We're just friends.

52
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,410
There. The restaurant I told you about.

53
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:55,467
Let's go.

54
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,448
Change the topic all you want.
I'll make you talk, Fah.

55
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,478
Fah is gone because he's drunk.

56
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,908
Where are you, Ping?
Why are you not picking up?

57
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,681
How can I be a good friend
to you like before, Tap?

58
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:51,724
Hey, that's enough.

59
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:55,037
Your foot will hurt tonight.

60
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:59,245
What? It won't kill me.

61
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,737
I'll be fine when I wake up.

62
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:06,998
Your foot will be fine,
but the alcohol won't heal your heart.

63
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:12,298
- Do you want a piece of my foot?
- Shut up, Charles.

64
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:15,378
You can't beat Sher.

65
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:21,444
I can kick both of you.

66
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:25,650
Cheers.

67
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:34,277
Sher.

68
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:40,030
Your harshness will not make love better.
It will only make it worse.

69
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:54,572
Why are you drinking so much tonight?
Are you stressed?

70
00:06:54,981 --> 00:07:01,200
No, I drink a lot when I'm on vacation.

71
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:10,138
You can talk to me
if something's bothering you.

72
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,188
If you keep it to yourself,
you'll only know your perspective.

73
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:25,131
Well... Do you have a boyfriend?

74
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:28,926
Well... Not yet.

75
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:32,976
I had one, but I need a break.

76
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:34,525
Why?

77
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:38,485
You're cute.
Why do you not want a boyfriend?

78
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,925
I feel guilty.

79
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:45,338
When I was in a relationship,
I was paranoid and unreasonable.

80
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,573
I was so self-centered.

81
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:50,717
I was also jealous.

82
00:07:56,103 --> 00:08:00,001
Fah, I don't know
what you and Sher are fighting about.

83
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:04,451
But if you don't open your heart,
it will haunt you forever.

84
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:10,285
How do we know that we won't
make our love worse if we say it?

85
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:17,615
We know if our words are our thoughts
or what actually happened.

86
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:22,258
Don't leave it.
Time can make it worse as well.

87
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:34,386
Let's take a selfie together.

88
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,614
I need to use the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

89
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:00,783
Me too.

90
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:24,884
What should I say
to express the feelings in my heart?

91
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,052
Hi, Sher. I'm Apo.

92
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,073
Can I have your Line?

93
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:53,827
My friend likes you. He's afraid to ask you
because you might say no.

94
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,473
I see.

95
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:02,758
Apo, hello.

96
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,068
I didn't think I would see you here.

97
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,798
I texted you the other day,
but you never replied.

98
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,292
I thought I would never get a chance
to talk to you.

99
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,785
Luckily, I was waiting
for some friends tonight.

100
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,014
I'm a bit tipsy,
so I'm brave enough to walk up to you.

101
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:26,874
Do you want to drink with me, Apo?

102
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:32,912
Of course. I want to know you better.

103
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:36,466
Well...

104
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,928
- What about your friends?
- My friends?

105
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:46,333
It's fine. I'll tell them
that I'm with someone I want to talk to.

106
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,673
Hey, who is that?

107
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:05,470
I don't know.

108
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:09,884
But I don't think
Sher has good intentions.

109
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:13,788
Do you think he'll get himself
a new boyfriend?

110
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:17,981
I hope that won't happen.

111
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:22,587
You're heavy, Fah.

112
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:27,251
- Drink with me.
- That's enough. You're wasted.

113
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,882
This restaurant is good.
They provide good beds for napping.

114
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,730
We're back home, Fah.

115
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,284
Get some rest. Let's talk tomorrow.

116
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,305
What is it, Fah?

117
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,609
Don't leave me like this, Sher.

118
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,555
Pink.

119
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,510
Pink, I'm sorry.

120
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,813
Damn it.

121
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,474
Fah.

122
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,178
- Damn it.
- Fah.

123
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,440
Fuck.

124
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:04,400
Fah.

125
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,357
Fah, stop it.

126
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:12,395
Fah, I know you didn't mean to.
You thought I was Sher, right?

127
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:32,264
I'm not mad at you.
I slapped you because I was shocked.

128
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,535
I'm sorry, Pink.

129
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:43,498
Talk to me, Fah.

130
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,288
Do you miss Sherbet?

131
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,169
Tell me what the fight was about.

132
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:55,490
Tam.

133
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:00,915
Are you going to leave Sher with him?

134
00:14:03,044 --> 00:14:07,005
Yeah. You saw it.
He's not lonely anymore.

135
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,055
I thought you were rooting for Fahlan.
Why don't you stay to stop him?

136
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,916
- If you don't stay, I'll do it.
- Hey.

137
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:18,514
Come with me.

138
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,036
Leave Sher alone.

139
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:27,162
If he wants to run away from love,
he'll be the one who gets hurt.

140
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:29,630
Come on.

141
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,987
If you don't want to talk about it,
it's okay.

142
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:46,240
I just think it doesn't help
if you keep it to yourself.

143
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,295
I admit

144
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:58,405
that I like Sherbet

145
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:03,305
and I'm not okay
that he kissed Prince like that

146
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,844
even though it was on his forehead,
and not his lips.

147
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,181
It's not odd that you're jealous.

148
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,542
See? Even you would be jealous.

149
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,389
How could I not overthink?

150
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,985
I think that might not be
a big issue.

151
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:36,430
Sherbet might think it's because
you distrust each other.

152
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:41,587
But how could I trust him
after what he did?

153
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:51,864
Maybe you don't know him well enough.

154
00:15:58,973 --> 00:15:59,738
Hold on.

155
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,450
You haven't told me your name.
So... how can I contact you?

156
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:08,737
That's not necessary.

157
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,128
This is just a one-night stand.
Don't you know it?

158
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:17,573
You might be right. What should
I expect from a one-night stand?

159
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:22,111
This is how it's supposed to end.

160
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,413
But it didn't end that night.

161
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,389
You still met with him.

162
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:33,006
You met him often.
It's no longer a one-night stand.

163
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:36,214
You have feelings for him.

164
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,567
Feelings that might turn into love.

165
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:47,124
Ever since you met him,
what kind of person do you think he is?

166
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:55,738
He's strange. He doesn't talk much,
but he talks impolitely.

167
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:58,636
He doesn't hang out with anyone.

168
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:02,993
What a coincidence. Long time no see.

169
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:13,603
I was going to call you.

170
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:16,676
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

171
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,445
Send me the location. See you soon.

172
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,478
Sher wants to see me.

173
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:24,583
He said he's hungry.

174
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:26,841
I'm meeting him at our usual place.

175
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:30,668
But Sher always surprises me.

176
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,591
He also makes me smile.

177
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:37,911
I never thought he could
because he's so harsh.

178
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:46,114
See, Fah? You slowly started
to have feelings.

179
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:51,168
I've known him since we started university.

180
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,145
We had a class together.

181
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,315
He never hung out with anyone.

182
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:02,007
Everyone says that
he only does one-night stand.

183
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:06,824
Don't you think Sher is dating Prince?

184
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:09,663
Come on, Fah.

185
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:13,220
If that's true, Prince won't be this calm.

186
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,398
The rumors about you and Sher
are so talked about.

187
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:19,088
The fans are cheering on you guys.

188
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:21,749
Really?

189
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,283
You're right.

190
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,351
Sher and Prince are very close.

191
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:40,907
They've been close for a long time,
long before I came into the picture.

192
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:48,420
It seems like they only hang out
with each other.

193
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,835
Ever since I've met Sher,

194
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,030
he's always been with me.

195
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,655
He's never gone like the rumors
that he's only into one-night stands.

196
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:13,171
I think you should give him a chance
to adjust.

197
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:19,435
Sometimes he's trying to do
what he's never what done before.

198
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,452
Just like the beach now?

199
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:38,307
It's dark and scary,

200
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:41,564
but we know

201
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,836
that it will be beautiful in the morning.

202
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:55,283
I want you to date him.

203
00:19:56,194 --> 00:20:01,233
You'll not only be giving him a chance,
but you'll be giving yourself a chance too.

204
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:27,551
Wow.

205
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:33,358
Is this where you work?

206
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,193
It's like a professional studio.

207
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:41,812
I thought you were just a drunk
who could sing.

208
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:50,113
You can pretend to be the nice Fahlan,
why can't I be a professional musician?

209
00:20:57,247 --> 00:20:58,301
Teach me how to play guitar.

210
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:04,028
How are you going to remember the chords?

211
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,404
You only have dirty thoughts in your head.

212
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,861
I will use my heart to remember them.

213
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:18,898
I think you shouldn't play the guitar.
Go write a novel.

214
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:22,499
Your breath stinks.

215
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:26,564
My breath stinks?

216
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,917
Really?

217
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:32,371
Fah.

218
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:34,884
Don't you need to prepare
for your tennis match?

219
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:41,988
Fah.

220
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,757
Fah.

221
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:07,824
Hello, Sher. Are you still up?

222
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:09,910
What are you doing?

223
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:13,075
I miss you.

224
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:15,850
You're so fucked up.

225
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:20,487
You took a girl to the beach,
but you're saying you miss me.

226
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:26,588
Why? Isn't she sassy enough?

227
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,320
You posted a picture and looked happy.

228
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,888
Come on, Sher. Talk nicely.

229
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:35,897
I'm sorry

230
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:41,197
that I was too jealous.

231
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:44,920
I didn't even ask you.

232
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:46,768
Are you drunk?

233
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,938
Is the girl you brought not sassy enough?

234
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:54,940
Are you going to fuck women or men?

235
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,135
Sher.

236
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,173
I know that I'm wrong.

237
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,645
I just don't want you to do that
to anyone.

238
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:11,420
I forgot that Prince is your best friend.

239
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,988
You and I are just friends with benefits.

240
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,514
Don't you remember, Fah?

241
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:22,779
Sher, I'm done showering.

242
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,370
Apo.

243
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:27,476
Who are you with, Sher?

244
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,353
Sher.

245
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:32,659
Sher.

246
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:38,101
Apo.

247
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:56,226
(MER'Y - Beautiful skin in one bottle)

248
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:20,507
Pink.

249
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:22,828
Pink, please open the door.

250
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:25,444
Pink.

251
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,890
- What's wrong?
- We have to go back to Bangkok now.

252
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,940
Let's go. I'll tell you on the way back.

253
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,113
- Sher.
- Fah.

254
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:01,838
- Fah.
- Fah.

255
00:26:27,048 --> 00:26:30,158
Stop looking for him. He didn't come here.

256
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:31,973
Sher.

257
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:36,922
- Did you sleep with him?
- You know the answer.

258
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:41,315
- Why are you asking me?
- I want to hear it from you.

259
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,712
What do you think?

260
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:05,354
I trust you.

261
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,285
But if you did sleep with him,

262
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:22,599
I won't be mad.

263
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,493
It's my fault for doing that.

264
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:28,712
I let him in.

265
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:41,170
When you called me, I came home right away.

266
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,397
I didn't sleep with him.

267
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:52,684
Thank you, Sher.

268
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:55,244
Thank you.

269
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,844
Fah, go shower.

270
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:15,706
You're so sticky.

271
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:22,690
Hey. I forgot.

272
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:26,747
I'll be right back.
I have to take Pink home.

273
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,424
It's okay, Fah. It's okay.

274
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:33,964
I'll go home by myself. It's fine.
Don't worry.

275
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,054
You two should go shower.

276
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,435
- It's fine. I'll go home by myself.
- Are you sure?

277
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,802
I'll walk home. It's fine.

278
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:29,388
Gear.

279
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,494
I bought you some porridge.

280
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:35,370
You must be hungry.
You didn't come down to get food.

281
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:43,185
Thank you for being here.

282
00:30:47,031 --> 00:30:50,210
Ever since I met you,
I never want to be anywhere else.

283
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:08,571
Hey, Ping.

284
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:10,613
Hey.

285
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:16,785
Where were you?
You didn't pick up my calls.

286
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,530
Are you okay?

287
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:24,660
Can you tell me?

288
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,450
I am heartbroken.

289
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,522
I wanted to be alone.

290
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:35,105
Heartbroken?

291
00:31:58,815 --> 00:31:59,940
Can you tell me?

292
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:08,969
I went to the beach.
I spent some time alone.

293
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,105
I meant about the girl.

294
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,679
The one who broke your heart.

295
00:32:16,564 --> 00:32:17,166
Who is she?

296
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:20,781
Do I know her?

297
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:24,066
You don't need to know.

298
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:27,627
I made up my mind
to become friends with her.

299
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,427
Because

300
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:34,739
it can never be possible.

301
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:36,894
Damn it.

302
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:41,253
That's painful.

303
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:46,369
But it's less painful
than seeing her walk out of my life.

304
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,307
Okay.

305
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:25,466
Next time

306
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:29,825
don't disappear without telling me.

307
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:34,989
I'm worried about you.

308
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:21,904
- Tar, is everyone ready?
- They went to lunch.

309
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:24,147
They thought you would be late.

310
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,979
What? Why didn't you tell them
that I came back this morning?

311
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:31,688
I told them, but they went anyways.
So we can have a meeting all afternoon.

312
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:34,612
What about you? Do you want lunch?

313
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,078
I'm not hungry.

314
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,651
Sher and Fah made up
and I'm satisfied.

315
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,834
- I have to get ready.
- Hey.

316
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:47,084
If you haven't eaten, eat this.

317
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:49,388
Thanks.

318
00:35:01,345 --> 00:35:06,103
Pink, is Fah okay?

319
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,658
Is he able to rehearse?

320
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:15,212
He's just hurt, but he's fine
because he's got a good counselor like me.

321
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:20,747
But I don't know if he'll have the energy
to rehearse today.

322
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,183
What are you talking about?
You're a pervert.

323
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:31,601
- Did something happen between you and him?
- Are you nuts? Of course not.

324
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,612
But I mean...

325
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:35,414
I wouldn't mind.

326
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:39,323
I can't believe her.

327
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:43,428
She's cute when she talks dirty.

328
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:54,868
Are you sure it's edible?

329
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:01,106
You have to eat it anyways.

330
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:05,536
Aren't you going
to rehearsal with me today?

331
00:36:06,203 --> 00:36:08,836
You have a fitting
and a photoshoot tomorrow.

332
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,346
I promised you that I'll go.

333
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:15,838
But today I have to finish the model.

334
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:23,212
Sher, don't be naughty like last night.

335
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:26,051
It made me scared.

336
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:30,739
I'm not naughty
like the first day we met.

337
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:36,258
I know that I'm naughty.

338
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:41,584
But I'm a good boy to you.

339
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:49,325
Promise me that you'll be patient
with me.

340
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:52,713
I'm trying.

341
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:57,632
Okay, I promise.

342
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:14,875
I'll help you.

343
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:23,091
I'll go home to get my things
and come back here to work on the model.

344
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,108
I think we'll finish late.

345
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:28,653
You can stay over.

346
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:32,236
I was hoping to do so.

347
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,594
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

348
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:52,203
Are you hungry? I'm done with rehearsal.
I'll be home soon.

349
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,506
Are you at the university?

350
00:37:57,058 --> 00:37:58,566
Oh, you're performing
at Korb-Lok Music Bar.

351
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,884
I'll see you there.

352
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:03,357
Did you drive?

353
00:38:04,654 --> 00:38:06,357
You're right.

354
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:10,139
I have a personal driver.
I shouldn't have driven here.

355
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:13,781
Come on. You're too adorable.

356
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,035
I'll take you home after you perform.

357
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:19,638
I'll ask Tap to take my car.

358
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,180
Okay.

359
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:28,665
Fah, are you leaving?

360
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:32,909
- Yes.
- Do you want to drink with me?

361
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:36,827
I'm sorry. I have a date with my boyfriend.

362
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,172
Okay, drive safely.

363
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:48,918
A boyfriend can be broken up with.
Who cares?

364
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:55,162
Hey. Hold on.

365
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:57,515
Why did you drag me outside?

366
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:01,338
- Who are you looking at?
- Tar.

367
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:04,826
I don't trust that Pie.
Did you see how he looked at Fah?

368
00:39:05,118 --> 00:39:07,446
Where did Anna find this boy?

369
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,193
Pink, calm down.

370
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,321
Pie is from our department.

371
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:16,350
It's not weird that he's helping out.

372
00:39:16,503 --> 00:39:17,886
Don't panic.

373
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:21,968
Why are you so worried about Fah?

374
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:23,218
Tar.

375
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:27,057
It wasn't easy
to help Fah and Sherbet make up.

376
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:30,157
Do you think I'll let Pie
ruin it so easily?

377
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:36,523
Well... If Fahlan really loves Sherbet,

378
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:39,707
no one can destroy their relationship.

379
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:43,755
You really don't understand.

380
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,674
A person like Pie is scary.

381
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:49,885
What do you want to do?

382
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:52,261
Kick him out?

383
00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:56,612
- Be professional.
- I don't mean it like that.

384
00:39:56,872 --> 00:40:01,735
But you have to help me keep an eye
on him, so he doesn't mess with Fah.

385
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,742
Because you told me that you'll help me.

386
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:10,589
(MER'Y - Beautiful skin in one bottle)

387
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,821
I thought you weren't coming.

388
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,354
You never replied.

389
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:32,814
Isn't Tap here with you?

390
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:37,852
- Have you not seen him?
- I have.

391
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:40,308
But he went to pick Namwan up.

392
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:45,624
He seems serious about her.

393
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,308
He even went to pick her up.

394
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:55,745
What about you? What's wrong with you?
You've been acting mysteriously.

395
00:40:56,397 --> 00:40:58,241
You disappeared without telling us.

396
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:02,683
Do you know how worried Tap was?

397
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:09,603
Fah.

398
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:13,142
I have to go set up.
I'm performing soon.

399
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,818
Are you going to tell me
where you went?

400
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:31,538
Ping.

401
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:34,725
It's been awhile since I've seen you here.

402
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:38,717
Fah invited me to see Sher perform.

403
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,532
You don't come here often, do you?

404
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:44,772
I heard you like to go clubbing.

405
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:50,156
Why didn't you check
that Sherbet was performing here tonight?

406
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,390
- We should leave.
- Are you nuts?

407
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,887
He'll think I'm scared of him.

408
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:01,628
Ping, please excuse us.

409
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:18,397
Thank you.

410
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:27,873
Hello, Fah and Ping.

411
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:45,557
Pai, why are you staring at Fahlan?

412
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:46,996
I thought you were embarrassed.

413
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:50,686
I'm not staring at him.

414
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,323
I have a new target now.

415
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,811
- Who?
- Ping.

416
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,823
Look at him. He's pretty cute.

417
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:03,430
Are you all right, Ping?

418
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:07,057
Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,581
Does Ping know Pai? I can't believe it.

420
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:38,218
Do you know him?

421
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,091
Pai is a net idol
who does a lot of reviews online.

422
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,509
I bought a skincare because of him once.

423
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,638
How does Ping know him?

424
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:56,372
I don't know, but I want to find out.

425
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:21,964
- Two glasses of beer.
- If I get drunk, please take me home.

426
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,232
Of course, Ping.

427
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:28,859
Excuse me, two more glasses of beer please.

428
00:44:49,515 --> 00:44:53,547
(Next Episode)
This thing between Ping and Tap...
I'm waiting to see what Ping will do.

429
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:55,623
Does Ping like Tap?

430
00:44:55,689 --> 00:45:01,283
I want you to think carefully.
Who makes you happy?

431
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,384
Was Namwan talking about Ping?

432
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:06,146
How did it turn out this way?

433
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,479
What would Tap think?

434
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:10,497
It's between the two of them.

435
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:14,115
If Ping told the truth about how he feels,
it would have been a different story.

436
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:17,335
Thank you for always supporting me, Prince.

437
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,633
What's the matter with you, Fah?

438
00:45:20,173 --> 00:45:22,119
You make me feel
like I did something wrong.

439
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:25,650
You did nothing wrong. It was me.

440
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,734
Can't I be the only one you kiss?

441
00:45:28,761 --> 00:45:31,816
We're just friends with benefits.
What more do you want from me?

442
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:16,914
