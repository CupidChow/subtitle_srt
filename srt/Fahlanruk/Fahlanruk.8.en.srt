Are you sure you're not coming?

13
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,795
It's not that I don't want to go see you.

14
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,154
But I have work to do.

15
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:22,991
I'm just calling to tell you
that I won't be going to your game.

16
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:25,158
Tap has a fever.

17
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:26,393
I gave him a wipe.

18
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,275
Well, take good care of your boyfriend.

19
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:31,698
Or he knows?

20
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:33,432
Sher.

21
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,409
You're here to support me, weren't you?
Why are you wearing a mask then?

22
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:38,733
Are Sher and Fah really dating?

23
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,793
I don't know what Sher is thinking.

24
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:46,319
But with Fahlan...
He seems more special.

25
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:49,355
We just ate.
Why are you buying so many things?

26
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,698
Are you all right, Sher? It seems like
you don't want me to go to your house.

27
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:56,173
If one day you don't want to go,

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,463
what will I do?

29
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:06,586
Sometimes certain feelings
are difficult to express

30
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,916
to other people.

31
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,408
Some people use words.

32
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,023
Some people use actions.

33
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:27,856
But some people can't express them at all.

34
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,166
Not even with their eyes.

35
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:36,211
Especially a feeling you want to express
to a certain someone.

36
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:44,678
You only feel like this
with just one person.

37
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:03,601
(A feeling that's not meant for everyone)

After looking at this house,

41
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,043
it's a beautiful house.

42
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,387
I'm sorry, Tap.

43
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,787
I was talking to Fah
and lost track of time.

44
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,571
Fah played really well today.

45
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:00,926
Top form as always.

46
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,432
It's ready to eat, Tap.

47
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:04,780
Oh.

48
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:06,663
Namwan.

49
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:11,170
I'm sorry for not asking your permission
to come.

50
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,875
Tap was sick, so I hurried here.

51
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,892
It's fine.

52
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,542
What did you buy? Come eat together.

53
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,518
I'm not sick like you.

54
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,522
I don't need to eat porridge.

55
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,078
Also, I already ate with Fah.

56
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm glad you're here, Namwan.

57
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:34,358
So I don't have to worry.

58
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,660
Wait, you're acting
like you're going somewhere.

59
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,295
I'm going out for a drink
with some friends.

60
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,378
I wasn't going to go at first.

61
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,347
I really have to thank you, Namwan.

62
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,498
It's fine. I'll stay with Tap.

63
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,478
Ping.

64
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:55,628
Hold on. Ping.

65
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:05,378
Eat some porridge,
so you can take your medicine and sleep.

66
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:06,320
Wait.

67
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:09,447
It's fine. I'll eat by myself.

68
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,692
Prince.

69
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,970
Can I buy some food
and eat with you here next time?

70
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:32,866
Of course.

71
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:36,083
I'll go now.

72
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:37,191
Okay.

73
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,351
Bye.

74
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,212
Ouch.

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,453
I'm fine.

76
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,883
Bye.

77

Why are Ping's things
separated to two sides?

87
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:51,675
(Ping / Tap)

88
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,554
Thank you.

89
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:08,727
Thank you.

90
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,668
That's Ping. Why is he sleeping here?

91
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:24,375
Hello. I'm almost there. See you soon.

92
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,750
Hey. It's already 7 p.m.

93
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,843
Tap hasn't eaten.
I should get him some food.

94
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:40,531
I have to call Fah.

95
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,320
Hello, Fah. Did you win?

96
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,303
I knew you would win.

97
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:51,513
Tap?

98
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:53,700
He's better now.

99
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,712
Okay, I'll get him some food.

100
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,653
Why did Ping lie about going with Fahlan

101
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:04,100
when he was sleeping here?

102
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,668
How are you, Tap?

103
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:17,813
Are you better?

104
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,810
I'm sorry, Namwan.

105
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:26,324
I was passed out.

106
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,474
What time is it?

107
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,955
- It's almost midnight.
- What? Midnight?

108
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,275
Is Ping not back yet?

109
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,233
He must be wasted by now.

110
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,118
He's a lightweight who likes to brag.

111
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:47,195
Don't worry about him.
He went with his friends.

112
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,550
Someone will take care of him.

113
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,981
Are you sure you're better now?

114
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,124
Do you want me to stay with you
until Ping comes back?

115
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:57,412
It's okay.

116
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,861
It's late now. You should go home.

117
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,075
I'll take you home.
Fah left his car with me.

118
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,248
I drove here.

119
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,243
You should rest.

120
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,929
If Ping comes back and doesn't see you,
he'll get worried.

121
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:18,266
You're right.

122
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,380
If he comes back, he'll start shouting.

123
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,149
Then I'll leave now.

124
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,540
I'll let you know when I'm home.

125
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,355
Drive safely.

126
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:52,154
Bye.

127
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,219
Who did Ping go with?

128
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,403
Did Fah go with him?

129
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,142
Fah, I'm hungry again.

130
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:29,591
You're hungry again?

131
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,521
You had two bowls of noodles
before coming home.

132
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,290
Or do you want to eat me?

133
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,441
You haven't had any dessert, have you?

134
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,562
You're a savory, not a dessert.

135
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,137
Then eat a savory,

136
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:48,201
and I'll make you dessert after.

137
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:03,531
Hello. What is it, Tap?

138
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,010
You have the worst timing.

139
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:08,992
Hold on, Fah. Why is it so quiet?

140
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,138
I don't hear anything at all.

141
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,446
Aren't you drinking with Ping?

142
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,000
No, he's taking care of you, isn't he?

143
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,442
Why are you asking me about him?
I don't know.

144
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,693
He told me that he's going out for a drink
with some friends.

145
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:24,490
I thought you're there with them.

146
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,704
He won't pick up my calls.

147
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,840
I don't know who he's with.

148
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,426
I haven't seen him all day.

149
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:34,317
Tap.

150
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,538
You're the only one
who can find Ping when he goes missing.

151
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,229
I'm hanging up. I'm sleepy.

152
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:50,737
Who did Ping go with?

153
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,668
Go sleep if you're sleepy.

154
00:12:58,356 --> 00:13:00,754
I was just trying to hang up.
I'm not actually sleepy.

155
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,367
You can't run away from me.

156
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,171
I turned off my phone.

157
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,404
No one can stop us.

158
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,563
But I haven't turned mine off.

159
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:20,747
Yes, Silly Boo?

160
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:29,833
The project?

161
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:31,934
Yes?

162
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:34,887
Okay.

163
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,604
Okay.

164
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,429
I won't call you Silly Boo.

165
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,046
Go to sleep or you won't have the energy
to cheer tomorrow.

166
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,036
Okay. Bye.

167
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:56,193
I thought you showered
because you came up first.

168
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,185
Shower?

169
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,042
I'm sick of waiting for you.

170
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:05,947
Don't be obsessed.

171
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:07,704
Go shower.

172
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:13,258
Let's do it after your match tomorrow.

173
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:21,976
You're flirting with me so hard.
I can't wait till tomorrow, Sher.

174
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:52,437
Tap.

175
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,206
I'm here to pick you up.

176
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:00,130
How did you know I was here?

177
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:05,610
You'll only go to Korb-Lok Music Bar
to drink alone.

178
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,108
Why are you mad at me?

179
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,252
You didn't pick up my calls.

180
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,721
Come. Let's go home.

181
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:30,923
What's the matter with you, Tap?

182
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:34,264
I should be the one asking you.

183
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,820
You didn't pick up my calls.

184
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,596
You lied about drinking with friends.

185
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:40,875
Why did you lie to me?

186
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:42,686
Why did you do that, Ping?

187
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,307
Well...

188
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,875
I want you to be alone with Namwan.

189
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:53,282
Where is she?

190
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:56,481
- Is she waiting in the car?
- She left.

191
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:00,627
Yeah.

192
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:04,763
I'm sorry that Namwan came to your room.

193
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,570
She just came. I didn't know what to do.

194
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,381
I know that it's your private space.

195
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,205
You don't want anyone to come.

196
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:21,258
Yes, the only person
who I want there is you, Tap.

197
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:22,623
Are you sleepy?

198
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,123
You drank a lot, didn't you?

199
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:28,451
Yeah, I can't take it anymore.

200
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,100
I'll puke if I stay.

201
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,116
Hold me so you don't fall.

202
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:02,425
Ping.

203
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,527
Why don't you go shower?

204
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,729
Ping.

205
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:12,482
He's asleep.

206
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:29,053
Ping.

207
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,337
Ping, where are you?

208
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,316
Where did he go so early in the morning?

209
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,573
Why isn't he picking up?

210
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:36,895
That's strange.

211
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:40,484
There must be a problem.

212
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,148
Fah, is Ping with you?

213
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,411
No, what is it now?

214
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,520
I'm going to the bathroom.

215
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,913
Buy me some food.

216
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,325
Haven't you seen him since last night?

217
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,003
I did.

218
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:19,516
He left this morning.

219
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:21,724
He won't pick up my calls.

220
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,905
I think he's acting strange.

221
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,204
Can you try calling him?
I want to know if he'll pick up.

222
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,717
If he does, then he's mad at me.

223
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,848
That's why he's avoiding me.

224
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,051
Listen to me.

225
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:41,741
He might be dealing with something
that he doesn't want to talk about.

226
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:45,872
He's not picking up,
but it doesn't mean he's mad at you.

227
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,263
What's the matter with you?

228
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,474
You seem to be minding Ping's business
in a weird way.

229
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,981
It's nothing.

230
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:57,113
Are you at the university?
I'll get ready and see you there.

231
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:57,945
Bye.

232
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,480
Damn it, Tap.

233
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:02,246
He just hung up.

234
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:18,731
Fahlan. It's me, Pai.

235
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:22,042
I asked you about breaking up
with Tle once.

236
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,470
Oh, right. What is it?

237
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:27,573
Well...

238
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:32,059
I saw you sitting alone.
Do you need some company?

239
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,464
Didn't you go get food, Fah?

240
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,356
I just hung up from Tap.

241
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:44,058
I'll go get some food for us.

242
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:46,096
Hold on, Sher.

243
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,819
Pai, I know what you want.

244
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,790
But I don't think so.

245
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:01,449
I don't change my mind easily
like what people say.

246
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,599
You didn't have to be that harsh, Fah.

247
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:22,530
We have to be harsh to some people
for them to stop.

248
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:26,796
My life won't be peaceful anymore.

249
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:30,465
I won't let anyone hurt you.

250
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:34,578
Go get food. You have a basketball match.

251
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,198
Will you stop now?

252
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:49,522
He was so harsh. I'll back off.

253
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,474
It's good that Fah said that
in front of Sher.

254
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:57,972
If he did it in front of others,
you'll be so humiliated.

255
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:01,612
- Are you sad?
- Of course not.

256
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,031
I'm so pretty.
I can get a new boy whenever I want.

257
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:10,080
You're so pretty.

258
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,912
Hey. Watch your back.

259
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:38,378
I'm sorry.

260
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,866
- I didn't mean to.
- It's okay.

261
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:46,254
Sherbet seems really hurt.

262
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,601
- Hey.
- Why isn't the medic here yet?

263
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,017
Stop it, Charles.

264
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,419
He hurt you because it was a foul.

265
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:57,143
We shouldn't let it go.

266
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,224
He didn't mean it. Calm down.

267
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:06,125
Sher.

268
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:09,291
Fah.

269
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,645
Who is this?

270
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:21,864
How are you?

271
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,467
My ankle hurts a little.

272
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:35,720
You didn't break your leg.

273
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,066
You should go to the first aid room.

274
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:40,154
I'll bring the car.

275
00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:46,478
Hey. Is that your boyfriend?

276
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:48,982
Boyfriend? No, he's a friend.

277
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:52,116
- Get me up.
- Fine.

278
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:58,028
Who is he? I've never seen him before.

279
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:00,119
Yeah.

280
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,003
He seems close to Sherbet.

281
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:05,034
He almost punched the other guy.

282
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:09,398
I hope it's not what I think.

283
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:11,527
There can't be another player.

284
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,400
My dream can't be destroyed.

285
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,346
Charles, why are you here?

286
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,750
I went to see Sher's basketball match.

287
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:42,817
He got into an accident,
so we brought him here.

288
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:45,821
Hey, Fahlan.

289
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:49,042
Sher's so lucky.

290
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:51,090
Someone's always taking care of him.

291
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:57,027
You're so brave to be going after Sher.

292
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:59,425
You think he'll choose you?

293
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:06,793
I don't know about that,
but he's with me every day.

294
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,832
Unlike someone here
who think he's so important.

295
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:11,442
Hey.

296
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:13,111
Calm down.

297
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:17,313
This is the first aid room.
Why are you guys fighting?

298
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,857
Thank you.

299
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:41,125
Damn it, Charles.

300
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:44,994
What did you do?
You're always causing me trouble.

301
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:50,127
Fah. This asshole is Charles.

302
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,130
He looks older than me,

303
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,395
but he's my half-brother.

304
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:58,397
He just move back here.
He's studying Arts.

305
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:07,273
Your family members are all evil.

306
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,989
Nice to meet you, Fahlan.

307
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:19,155
If you want my brother,
you have to be serious.

308
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:22,452
Sher is secretly a crybaby.

309
00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:28,713
You speak Thai fluently.

310
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:30,837
I scold in Thai fluently too.

311
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:34,268
Sher taught me well.

312
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:37,575
- Damn it, Charles.
- Ouch.

313
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:38,747
Sher.

314
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:41,564
You'll get hurt.

315
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,660
Charles likes to piss me off.

316
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:52,885
Why are you here, Tam?

317
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:54,962
Did Charles call you?

318
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:58,444
You're so nosy.

319
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,675
I'm not dying.

320
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,603
Turk, my friend who's a medic, called me.

321
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,852
Tap, I'll leave my car with you.
Just drive it.

322
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:13,034
Let's go home.

323
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:15,586
Sher.

324
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:20,666
Are you all right?

325
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:23,522
I saw the post in the Cute Boy page.
I was so worried.

326
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:26,697
Sher, did you break your leg?

327
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:30,538
Come on, Prince.

328
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:32,492
I just hurt my ankle.

329
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:34,962
I'll be better tomorrow.

330
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,059
I'm worried about you.

331
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,461
You've never got into an accident.

332
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:46,887
I'm fine. It's nothing.

333
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,764
Gear, are you really taking care of Prince?

334
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,621
Why is he panicking?

335
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:58,315
Yeah. It was better when
you were taking care of him. Sorry, Sher.

336
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,327
All clear? Sher needs to rest.

337
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:16,052
Gear.

338
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:22,461
What's the matter? Why do you look so sad?

339
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,864
You hugged Sher.

340
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:28,385
Of course I'm sad.

341
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:30,797
I was just worried about him.

342
00:29:32,785 --> 00:29:33,606
I know.

343
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,278
But I can't help it.

344
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:39,340
You did that to Sher.

345
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:43,084
But you never did that to me.

346
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:47,446
Gear.

347
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,555
I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable.

348
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:55,690
I admit that you make me so happy.

349
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,771
But if it makes you this uncomfortable,

350
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:04,386
- I think we shouldn't start anything.
- Prince.

351
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:07,985
I'm sorry. I was just upset.

352
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:09,634
I'm not mad.

353
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:13,266
I know that you two are close.

354
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:16,971
Stop it, Gear. Your excuse sucks.

355
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,776
- Don't mention it.
- Prince.

356
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,486
What did I say wrong?

357
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,113
Sher was there before I was.

358
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,612
Damn it. But he shouldn't have said that.

359
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:33,805
That means.

360
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,169
Prince doesn't care about me at all.

361
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:40,712
Prince.

362
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,303
Silly Boo seems really worried about you.

363
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,381
He hugged you like you were dying.

364
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:04,884
Prince is always like this.
He worries about everything.

365
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:07,947
He's better with Gear by his side.

366
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,872
He used to cry about every little thing.

367
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:13,787
You know him so well.

368
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,292
Why are you so sarcastic?

369
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:21,328
I wasn't being sarcastic.
I'm just pissed.

370
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,425
Don't you feel anything at all
that you let him hug you in front of me?

371
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,481
- You even kissed him.
- How should I be feeling?

372
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:34,424
Prince is just a friend.

373
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:47,178
What kind of friends kisses?

374
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:49,899
So you'll fuck soon, right?

375
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:55,138
No one has dirty thoughts like you do, Fah.

376
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:59,229
If you can't handle it, just don't.

377
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,203
Things were going great.

378
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,046
In the end, it ended how I expected.

379
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:40,270
This sponsor gave us things.

380
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,924
Can you go get them?
We need them for the fitting, Jan.

381
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:46,674
- I told them I'll pick them up tomorrow.
- Okay, great.

382
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,011
- Did you see?
- Hey, Em.

383
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,127
What is it? Calm down.

384
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:58,555
This means no one saw
Fah's Facebook post, right?

385
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,685
- We have a problem.
- Why? What happened to Fah?

386
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,357
He posted on Facebook that he's looking
for a model to go to the beach.

387
00:34:05,537 --> 00:34:08,373
How many days is he's going?
What about our rehearsals?

388
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,643
- Shit.
- Shit.

389
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:18,170
Fah.

390
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:20,812
Pink.

391
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:22,611
Can we talk?

392
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,136
(Tap - 50 missed calls)

393
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,975
(Namwan)

394
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,486
Hello, Charles.

395
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:53,315
I'm glad you called.

396
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,523
Let's go get a drink.

397
00:37:20,892 --> 00:37:22,915
I thought you were asleep.

398
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,850
I'm sorry. It took so long
for me to get ready.

399
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:29,358
Just call me Fah. It makes us closer.

400
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:34,050
Okay. Shall we go?

401
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:35,116
Let's go.

402
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:45,898
Wait for me.

403
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:57,272
Why didn't you take me
to Korb-Lok Music Bar?

404
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,666
We drove so far.

405
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,762
I don't want to see people I know.

406
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:05,924
I want to just listen to music.

407
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:08,944
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

408
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:12,876
Fight? You're talking nonsense, Charles.

409
00:38:13,662 --> 00:38:16,466
Also, he's not my boyfriend.

410
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:19,440
I just want a drink.

411
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:27,852
When I helped with the stage today,
I saw Fahlan.

412
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,698
He wasn't there for rehearsal.

413
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:33,691
He came to say something and left.

414
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:35,890
Sher.

415
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:38,733
Even though I'm your little brother,

416
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:43,067
I spend more time with you
than Tam does.

417
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:46,528
Of course I know how you feel.

418
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:52,443
If the problem isn't that big, calm down.

419
00:38:53,937 --> 00:38:57,554
This is why
you can't find the love you're waiting for.

420
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,731
What did Tam tell you?

421
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:07,313
If he did, would I be here with you?

422
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:10,499
I know you love Fahlan.

423
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,755
I can tell he's special.

424
00:39:19,183 --> 00:39:20,129
I don't know.

425
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,522
I really don't know, Charles.

426
00:39:25,388 --> 00:39:27,279
The feeling I'm having...

427
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:29,962
Is it love or am I just lonely?

428
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:33,705
What's the reason I let him in?

429
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,163
If you don't know yourself,

430
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:43,660
you should keep him in your life.
Don't run away from him.

431
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:46,915
This is what you always do.

432
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:54,258
I think I should back off
to figure myself out.

433
00:39:55,513 --> 00:39:57,217
I'm not running away, Charles.

434
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,908
I just think
that if we're fighting about small things,

435
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,259
how can we be happy

436
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,746
if we keep fighting with our boyfriend?

437
00:40:07,348 --> 00:40:11,459
But the small things you mentioned
might be a big deal to Fahlan.

438
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:23,586
(Next Episode)
Where are you, Ping? Why aren't you picking up?

439
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,960
How can I be a good friend
to you like before, Tap?

440
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:33,046
Your harshness will not make love better.
It will only make it worse.

441
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:36,275
I don't know what
you and Sherbet are fighting about.

442
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:40,555
But if you don't open your heart,
it will haunt you forever.

443
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,961
Hello, Sher. I'm Apo.

444
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,373
Who is he?

445
00:40:44,704 --> 00:40:46,314
If he chooses to run away,

446
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:48,550
he'll be the one who gets hurt.

447
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:52,878
You took a girl to the beach,
but you're saying you miss me.

448
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,401
Isn't she sassy enough?

449
00:40:56,545 --> 00:40:57,459
Sher.

450
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:58,954
I'm done showering.

451
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:00,888
Who are you with, Sher?

452
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:02,410
Sher.

453
00:41:45,391 --> 00:41:47,727
