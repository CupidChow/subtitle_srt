I miss you.

You took a girl to the beach,
but you're saying you miss me.

Sher.

15
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:23,154
I'm done showering.

00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,558
Who are you with, Sher?

I trust you.

21
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,815
Sher, don't be naughty like last night.
It made me scared.

22
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:40,187
Promise me that you'll be patient
with me.

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,265
- I'm trying.
- I promise.

24
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:47,442
Ping, it's been awhile
since I've seen you here.

25
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:49,488
Does Ping know Pai?

26
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:53,361
- They seem really close.
- How does Ping know him?

27
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,052
Love is not a feeling
we get the first time we meet someone.

28
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:04,333
But it's a feeling
that we continue to have.

29
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,978
Even though we try to find reasons
to stop us from confessing our love.

31
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,573
it doesn't make us happy like we thought.

32
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:21,292
They say where there is love,
there is pain.

33
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:28,668
We willingly accept the pain
to keep the love in our heart and eyes.

Here. Take my car.

39
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,652
That's why you didn't drink much tonight.
Sher barely drank at all.

40
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,898
I have to work on the model tonight, Tap.

41
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,711
I have to go.

42
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,714
Take Ping home. He's always the most drunk.

43
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,568
Come on. That's enough.

44
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,887
- Come here.
- Drive safely.

45
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,683
- See you.
- Good luck.

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,911
- Bye.
- I'm leaving.

47
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:20,573
Are you all right?

48
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:26,731
Don't act so tough. Hang on to me.

49
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:32,020
You'll fall. See?

50
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:37,770
Damn it. I'm fine.

51
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,974
Walk to the car.
I'll take Namwan home first.

52
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:46,773
Go ahead. I'll go drink with some friends.

53
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,072
Ping.

54
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:53,675
Let's go.

55
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:06,989
Shall we go then?

56
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:08,452
- Let's go.
- Okay.

57
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,220
Fah.

58
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:18,333
Why are Ping and Tap mad at each other?

59
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,988
It felt weird especially
when Ping danced with someone else.

60
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,620
Tap acted like he wasn't happy.

61
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:32,486
This thing between Ping and Tap...
I'm waiting to see what Ping will do.

62
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,013
What do you mean?

63
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:38,173
Does Ping like Tap?

64
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,904
I think he's in love.

65
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,518
He has been for a long time.

66
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,732
How do you know that?

67
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,279
No matter how tough you are,

68
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:57,365
you can't hide the feelings
you have for someone you love.

69
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:01,718
Ping always puts Tap first.

70
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,435
I could tell since we were freshmen.

71
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:07,812
But it's not something I should talk about.

72
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:16,551
Do you think Ping will confess his love?

73
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:23,590
What about you? When are you confessing?

74
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:33,630
Don't overthink it.

75
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:38,781
Are you hungry? Let's go eat.

76
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:40,675
I think

77
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,858
we should eat at home.

78
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:46,779
If we are outside,

79
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:51,503
someone might see us.

80
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,013
Sure. I'll drive as fast as I can.

81
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:09,991
Tap.

82
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,017
Yes?

83
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:18,667
I think we can't be anything
more than friends.

84
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:25,591
What do you mean? Are you still mad
that I didn't call you back yesterday?

85
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,073
I was mad at first, but now I understand.

86
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:34,935
If you understand,
why do we have to break up?

87
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:48,364
You might not understand now
that your happiness doesn't lie with me.

88
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,228
I don't get it.

89
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,707
You might not get it now.

90
00:06:56,838 --> 00:07:03,077
I want you to think carefully.
Who makes you happy?

91
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,156
Is this how you want to break up with me?

92
00:07:19,082 --> 00:07:21,066
I'm just telling you how you feel.

93
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,974
I'll always be here for you.

94
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:41,519
But the person in your heart

95
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,707
just isn't me.

96
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:15,607
You might not understand now
that your happiness doesn't lie with me.

97
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,075
What the hell?

98
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:30,917
What does she mean?

99
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,464
Was Namwan talking about Ping?

100
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:50,524
I'll unfasten the seat belt for you.

101
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:02,778
Pai, I don't want this.

102
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,294
Why not?
Are you afraid someone might see us?

103
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:16,517
No, I just don't want to.

104
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:23,756
Tap.

105
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,068
Tap.

106
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:49,673
How did it turn out like this?

107
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:53,268
What would Tap think?

108
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:57,501
Damn it.

109
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:03,651
Fah, aren't you going to call your friends?

110
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:07,884
I think they looked really upset today.

111
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:11,986
Sher, I'm just their friend.

112
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,750
It's between the two of them.

113
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:17,064
I can't get too involved.

114
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:21,469
If Ping told the truth about how he feels,
it would have been a different story.

115
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:25,724
But I'm sure they'll make up.

116
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,772
Even if Ping doesn't confess to Tap,

117
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,975
he won't let Tap walk out of his life.

118
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:35,692
That's why I'm not worried.

119
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,220
Yeah, you're right.

120
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,224
By the way...

121
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:43,419
What about us?

122
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:45,293
What now?

123
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:50,749
About you being horny?

124
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,798
Stop it. You have a fitting tomorrow.

125
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:11,541
Sher.

126
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,444
Don't bite. You'll leave a hickey.

127
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:18,875
Don't act so fragile.
You chose not to listen to me.

128
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,729
Sher, stop.

129
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:30,497
Sher.

130
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,638
Is this how we're going to do it?

131
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:36,922
Sure.

132
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,754
Fah.

133
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,954
Hold on.

134
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:01,924
Can I wait outside? I don't want to go in.

135
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,904
I'm not involved with this play.

136
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:08,386
You're here with me
and you're important to me.

137
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,067
How can you not be involved?

138
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:15,664
Come on, Fah. I won't know how to act.

139
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:20,390
I think I should get you some food.

140
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,462
You haven't eaten anything.

141
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:28,773
Okay.

142
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:34,715
You're not ready to tell anyone
why you're here with me, right?

143
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,270
I get it.

144
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:44,701
Are you mad?

145
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,206
No, I'm not mad.

146
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,733
I said I get it.

147
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:02,008
Are you sure
you don't want to see my muscles?

148
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:07,605
Yeah, let the others see them.

149
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,981
Because when we're home,

150
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,836
the person who gets to touch them

151
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,618
is me.

152
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:22,789
Fah, hello. Hi, Sherbet.

153
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:26,706
I was about to call you.
The team's waiting for you. Let's go.

154
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,196
It's fine. I'll wait outside.

155
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:35,327
- I'm going to get him some food.
- Why? We have so much food. Come on.

156
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,153
It's fine, Pink. Let him buy me food.

157
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:42,941
I want to be taken care of too.

158
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:48,357
Okay. Let's get ready.
See you inside, Sherbet.

159
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,267
Congratulations on making up with him.

160
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,725
- I barely slept trying to make up to him.
- You're a pervert, Fah.

161
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:02,404
What is it, Prince?

162
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,212
Sher, are you coming to the university?

163
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:14,644
Really? I'll get Fah some food too
and go eat with you.

164
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:16,813
I want to talk to you.

165
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,508
Okay. Wait for me.

166
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:32,914
Oh, dear. Why are you so late, Pie?

167
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:37,855
- Don't scold me. I...
- You woke up late, didn't you?

168
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,138
Did you check with Jan?
How many powder pacts did they give us?

169
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:44,790
I did. The sponsor gave us one per shade.

170
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,028
Huh?

171
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,876
- One per shade?
- Yes.

172
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:51,761
- How will that be enough?
- Why?

173
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:56,051
Fahlan probably got bitten by a vampire.
He's covered in hickeys.

174
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:58,002
How are we going to cover them up
with just one pact of powder?

175
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:06,341
Sherbet.

176
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:25,261
Who is that?

177
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:28,018
Did he use to date Fah?

178
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:36,475
How about this, Pink?

179
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:38,888
The loincloth is quite short.

180
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,118
This is how it's supposed to be.

181
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:44,907
Mark was a farmer who had to work.

182
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:49,334
If the loincloth was longer than his knees,
it would have been hard for him.

183
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,721
This fits your character, Fah.

184
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,146
I'll let Anna tie it for you,
so it'll look good in pictures.

185
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,532
- Oh, my God.
- Don't tease me.

186
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,681
I'm embarrassed.

187
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,138
I won't. It makes me embarrassed
just looking at you.

188
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,152
Anna, help Fah with his loincloth.

189
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,681
- I can do it.
- That's fine.

190
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:25,458
- Anna can do it. Are those from the sponsor?
- Yes.

191
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,476
Help put the powder pacts
in front of the mirror, Pie.

192
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:32,170
- Hurry up. I need to get dressed.
- Pie, arrange them.

193
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,393
Come on, Fah. Let me see.

194
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:38,332
Let me see. Is it tight around the waist?

195
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:41,345
Okay, but it's not short enough.

196
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:46,771
This is great.

197
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:56,120
Are you going to tell me
about you and Ping last night?

198
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,660
Did you hook up? Did you have sex?

199
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:02,084
Really?

200
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,699
So you and Ping slept together?

201
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,733
I didn't get to go up to his room.

202
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:19,085
We were about to kiss
when he pushed me away.

203
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:24,538
He said he wasn't ready
and he ran out of the car.

204
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:28,913
A guy ran away from you.

205
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,330
What a waste of your fillers.

206
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:39,612
I'm sorry. I didn't think you were serious.

207
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,827
I wasn't at first.

208
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:49,564
But when I looked into his eyes,
I fell for him.

209
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,172
Take it slow then.

210
00:18:56,057 --> 00:19:00,517
Ping might not like that you're so forward.

211
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,535
Yeah. You're probably right.

212
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,300
(Ping)

213
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,419
Why am I so upset about Ping?

214
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,362
Em, did Tar go get food a long time ago?

215
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,972
- Yeah.
- Our break is almost over.

216
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:56,567
Where is he?

217
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,397
- There he is.
- I'm here.

218
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,673
- I'm here.
- Tar, why are you so late?

219
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,280
- Did you forget to order food?
- No.

220
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,953
I knew that I would get scolded.

221
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,353
I didn't forget, but the seller did.

222
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:20,445
Fine, don't be upset. I'm sorry.

223
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,433
- Pass the food around.
- Okay.

224
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:30,345
Here's your food.

225
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:33,408
- Here.
- Hey.

226
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,485
May I have one?

227
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:38,956
Is there something not spicy?
I don't like spicy food.

228
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:42,083
Take a look at it. What can you eat?

229
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,708
Please. You have one in your hand.

230
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:47,678
Open it for me.

231
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,349
This one is sweet pork.

232
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:53,597
If you can't eat this,
go find something else.

233
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:55,285
Take it.

234
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,632
So cute.

235
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,053
I'm mad.

236
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:21,051
Is this the guy who's chasing Pink?

237
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,773
Fah, let's do your makeup.

238
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:28,552
Okay.

239
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,665
(MER'Y Cica Intense Serum)
Let me put on my serum.

240
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,631
(MER'Y Cica Intense Serum)
Sure.

241
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:42,178
That's why your skin is so flawless.

242
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:44,634
You have no acne or rash.

243
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,899
May I have a look?

244
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,475
Sure, this is MER'Y.

245
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,836
It's amazing.

246
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,728
I have to try it too.

247
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:07,923
Pie, cover these marks with foundation.

248
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:09,351
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

249
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:24,917
Your skin is so flawless, Fahlan.

250
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,058
You look so clean and touchable.

251
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:31,742
Thank you.

252
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:37,283
What perfume are you wearing?

253
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,059
You smell so good.

254
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:42,036
Oh.

255
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:44,714
I'm wearing Sherbet's perfume.

256
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,036
I wore it this morning.

257
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,899
I don't know what brand it is.

258
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:51,331
I see.

259
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:54,842
I have to ask him where he got it from.

260
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:58,733
So I can wear it and smell good like you.

261
00:23:02,737 --> 00:23:06,237
I think you should find one that suits you.

262
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:12,305
Not everyone can wear the same perfume

263
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:15,693
and attract the same people.

264
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:23,169
Your breakfast is here.

265
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:29,749
But not yours, Fah.
You have someone delivering your food.

266
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,789
Your food is here, Sher.

267
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,751
What about Gear? Isn't he here too?

268
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:45,907
He went to get stuff for the model.
I'll meet him later.

269
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:48,092
Where is Fahlan?

270
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:50,451
Tell him to come eat together.

271
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:55,292
No, I'll bring him his food.

272
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:58,418
You want to talk to me, don't you?

273
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:03,710
- Yeah.
- Wait here. I'll bring him his food.

274
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:23,866
Hi, bro.

275
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:28,354
Damn it, Charles. What are you doing here?

276
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,628
I'm helping with the stage.

277
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:33,828
They needed someone
from the Arts Department.

278
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,149
I'm also here to woo Pink.

279
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:39,531
You think you can woo her?

280
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,708
Of course.

281
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,385
Did you make up with Fahlan
and bring him food?

282
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,875
- None of your business.
- He's in the dressing room.

283
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:54,006
Hey. Bring him his food.

284
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,865
- It's none of my business.
- Fuck you.

285
00:24:58,482 --> 00:24:59,998
Bring him his food now.

286
00:25:00,618 --> 00:25:04,212
If you don't, I'll deduct your allowance.

287
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,378
I'll do it right now.

288
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,106
Hey. I'll be right back.

289
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:15,294
My brother brought food for a guy.

290
00:25:29,466 --> 00:25:30,599
Why are you upset?

291
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:34,098
Charles is such an asshole.

292
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:45,338
By the way, what did you want
to talk to me about?

293
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,107
Do you want my help on the model?

294
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,185
I can do it myself.

295
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:56,905
I want to know
if you and Fahlan are a couple.

296
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:04,387
What did you buy?
Did you get my favorite food?

297
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,827
Sher, don't change the topic.

298
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:10,829
Answer me. I want to know.
Tell me the truth.

299
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:18,586
Honestly, Fah is a great guy.

300
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:21,498
I'm comfortable being with him.

301
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:25,842
But about us being a couple,

302
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:28,335
I need more time.

303
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:31,323
Time? How much time?

304
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:39,391
Sher, no one likes
a relationship that's unclear.

305
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:41,774
An unclear relationship.

306
00:26:43,616 --> 00:26:44,421
You're right.

307
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:52,754
You don't want to date me.

308
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:00,618
I don't love you like that.

309
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:04,733
But you're my best friend.

310
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:08,621
Don't be afraid to let someone in.

311
00:27:09,382 --> 00:27:10,913
Open your heart.

312
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,914
I'll always love you, Sher.

313
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:23,425
Thank you for always supporting me, Prince.

314
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:36,222
Sher, there you are.

315
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,379
Hello, Prince.
I didn't think I'd see you here.

316
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:46,271
Hello, Fahlan. I bought food...

317
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:51,267
I saw Prince when I went to get food,
so I asked him to join me.

318
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:55,323
You have company now.
Let's go eat inside.

319
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:59,092
Fah, let's eat here.

320
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,993
I really don't want to go in.

321
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,013
Charles is inside.

322
00:28:05,631 --> 00:28:07,108
He's an asshole.

323
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:15,930
No wonder he shouted that my boyfriend
bought me food when he saw me.

324
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,074
Fahlan, let's eat here together.

325
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:23,355
Sure, Prince.

326
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:28,467
Fuck you, Charles. He'll get a piece of me.

327
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:35,190
Prince, come watch the rehearsal next time.

328
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:38,403
- So Sher will have company.
- Can I do that?

329
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:42,746
I'll drag Sher here to see you every day.

330
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:50,254
Are you sure that Gear will let you
come see me that easily?

331
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,284
He understands things easily unlike you.

332
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:59,994
Sher likes to act complicated,
but he's not at all.

333
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,155
Fahlan and Sherbet are such a good match.

334
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:20,533
When I saw Fahlan talk
to Sherbet cutely today,

335
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,253
they were so cute.

336
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:31,183
Who knew a person like Fahlan
can be so sweet?

337
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:35,136
Do you think they will make it?
Sherbet's not a nobody.

338
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:37,533
Two popular people dating?

339
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,486
They seem to have the same personality.

340
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:42,300
They don't seem to care about anyone.

341
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:44,595
I had the same thought.

342
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:48,642
But when I saw Fahlan sulking today...

343
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,200
Oh, my God.

344
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:55,485
I could tell that Fah really loves him
or he won't be this obedient.

345
00:29:56,946 --> 00:30:01,173
You know well
that Fahlan never cared about anyone.

346
00:30:01,957 --> 00:30:02,683
You're right.

347
00:30:02,853 --> 00:30:07,557
He wasn't this open when he dated Tle
and we thought they dated for a long time.

348
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,408
That's true.

349
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:12,398
What did Fah fight with Sherbet about?

350
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,882
- Do you know?
- I don't.

351
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:18,767
But he rushed back to make up to him.

352
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,847
And you see how well that turned out.

353
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:22,986
- He's covered in hickeys.
- Oh, dear.

354
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:25,730
You're right.

355
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:27,608
I want to be Sherbet.

356
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:31,694
So fabulous.

357
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:35,146
What's going on? Hello, ladies.

358
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,259
You took a long time.

359
00:30:37,777 --> 00:30:39,722
You have to be ready
for the first shoot with Fah.

360
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,141
I know.

361
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,983
Anna, do you think I'm so free?

362
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:47,784
Do you know how chaotic it was
for me to check everything?

363
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:51,869
And that boy from the Arts Department.

364
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:55,619
Why did we ask for him?
I can't understand him.

365
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,249
Don't scold my Charles.

366
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:01,779
Everything can be forgiven
because of his handsomeness, right?

367
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't know,
but that's what I usually do.

368
00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:13,424
If I become handsome one day,
don't come asking for me.

369
00:31:13,754 --> 00:31:17,543
You'll need a plastic surgeon for that,
but you have to change now.

370
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,648
- Come on.
- Where?

371
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:26,593
- Hurry up.
- Hey. I'll check on Fah.

372
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:31,107
He's not her boyfriend,
but she acts like he is.

373
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,532
Just wait and see if I can get him.

374
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:40,575
You're secretly in love with her.
If you don't confess, you've already lost.

375
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:43,407
Found the outfit.

376
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,986
Sherbet, where's Fah?

377
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:52,530
He just walked in.

378
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:57,670
I didn't see him. He's probably
in the bathroom. Aren't you coming in?

379
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,790
I'll wait here.

380
00:32:00,888 --> 00:32:02,076
Okay, I'll go in first.

381
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:08,588
Are you here, Gear?

382
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,425
Wait there. I'll meet you there.

383
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:14,132
I have to go.

384
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:19,091
Go ahead. Thanks for dropping by, Prince.

385
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:23,995
Sher, you should go in
and show your support.

386
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:26,515
Try doing something
you've never done before.

387
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:30,036
It doesn't hurt to do it
for someone you love.

388
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:46,516
Thank you for always supporting me.

389
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:55,297
Damn it.

390
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:11,303
(Sherbet)
Fah, Pink's looking for you. Where are you?

391
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,939
(I'm on my way.)

392
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:40,922
Great, Fah.

393
00:33:42,513 --> 00:33:44,217
Turn to your side.

394
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:46,965
Turn to your side. Okay.

395
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:49,227
Put your hand on your waist.

396
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:59,458
Sher, you should go in
and show your support.

397
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:01,828
Try doing something
you've never done before.

398
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:05,159
It doesn't hurt to do it
for someone you love.

399
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:14,905
I did it, Prince.

400
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:37,198
- Ping.
- Tap.

401
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,602
I didn't think I'd see you here.

402
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:48,986
Yeah.

403
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:53,068
I thought I would go see Fah
at the photoshoot.

404
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:57,867
But I didn't want to get in the way
because Sher would be there.

405
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,191
And...

406
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,980
Why didn't you call me?

407
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,099
I was sleepy
and wanted to nap in the library.

408
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:22,194
I was going to call you when I wake up,
but you're here now.

409
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:30,347
And why didn't you call me?

410
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:35,172
Well...

411
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:38,525
Yeah.

412
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,300
I'm heartbroken.

413
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:45,170
Namwan dumped me yesterday.

414
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:49,765
Dumped you? Why?

415
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,626
Why didn't you call me?
Where were you last night?

416
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:56,514
Are you okay, Tap? You can talk to me.

417
00:35:57,617 --> 00:35:59,156
Calm down, Ping.

418
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:01,843
I can't keep up.

419
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:06,169
Are you okay?

420
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:10,844
I don't know.

421
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:13,658
But with you here,

422
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:16,957
I feel better.

423
00:36:29,407 --> 00:36:32,555
Do you want to go somewhere tonight?
I'll go with you.

424
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,164
Sure, let's go out.

425
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:44,593
I'm sorry, Ping. I'm so tired.
I'll take a rain check.

426
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:49,750
Just go with him. I'll call you later. Bye.

427
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,560
I'm sorry this ended so late, Fah.

428
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:55,554
Anna can take the makeup off you.

429
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:59,667
It's okay, Pink. I'll take it off at home.

430
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:01,833
I feel sorry for Sher.
He waited for a long time.

431
00:37:03,092 --> 00:37:07,569
- Take our t-shirt, so yours doesn't get messed up.
- Okay.

432
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:09,706
Anna, go get him a shirt.

433
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,155
Thanks.

434
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:30,293
So did Sher take your advice, Prince?

435
00:37:30,974 --> 00:37:33,795
I think he did.

436
00:37:34,348 --> 00:37:39,106
Sher likes to act tough,
but he's actually sensitive.

437
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:43,764
I think he probably did something
to make Fah feel better.

438
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:47,209
I'm sure that he really likes Fah.

439
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:52,945
Are all artists like this?
Do they all use their emotions first?

440
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,974
Gear, don't say that around Sher.
He'll scold me for not keeping his secret.

441
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:01,354
Don't worry. I just say it with you.

442
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:06,961
I'm just happy that SB,
the famous songwriter, is Sherbet.

443
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,699
You know that I really like SB's songs.

444
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:14,068
Sher is brilliant. He wrote songs
for international superstars.

445
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:16,055
He should sing his own songs.

446
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:23,235
Yeah, he has lost so many opportunities
because he prioritizes his privacy.

447
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:31,108
What about you? Do you also prioritize
your innocence, sorry, privacy like Sher?

448
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:35,379
Not really, but the timing is not right.

449
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:37,495
I know what you're thinking.

450
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:48,019
This is your reward for taking
such good care of me.

451
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:53,018
You're so sweet it made me surprised.

452
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:58,556
I didn't think I would dare do it.

453
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,886
I've never done it before.

454
00:39:12,674 --> 00:39:13,713
I've never done it too.

455
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:18,153
But I won't be taken advantage of.

456
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:29,225
It's already 6. I'll go get some food.

457
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:34,457
- You haven't eaten anything too, right?
- Yes.

458
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:58,889
Fah, I met a guy today
who looked at me in a weird way.

459
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:00,605
Did you date him?

460
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:08,060
He's Pie. He's a staff. I don't know him.

461
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,047
How did you know who I was referring to?

462
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:19,139
There's just one person
who's trying to get close to me.

463
00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:23,107
I thought you used to date him.

464
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm not friends with people I used to date.

465
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,690
And I didn't date him.

466
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,058
What's the matter with you, Fah?

467
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,448
Ever since we got in the car, you make me
feel like I did something wrong.

468
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:52,498
It's my fault

469
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,836
for overthinking and acting ridiculous.

470
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:00,234
What the fuck is wrong with him?

471
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:08,779
Hold on.

472
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:12,597
Talk to me. Don't walk away like this.

473
00:41:13,235 --> 00:41:17,267
- What did I do wrong?
- I said it's my fault, not yours.

474
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:22,331
It's my fault for thinking
that you and Prince are sleeping together.

475
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:25,570
It's also my fault
that I'm upset when you guys kiss.

476
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,613
I know that you are dating him.

477
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:30,990
I'm just your sex partner, right?

478
00:41:34,213 --> 00:41:36,323
You're looking down on me, Fah.

479
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:44,011
That's why I'm so upset.

480
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:47,824
If you think I'm that kind of person,

481
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,298
why are you dating me?

482
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,443
Go home. So you won't get upset again.

483
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:01,988
You never think we're a couple, do you?

484
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:05,838
That's why you never care
about my feelings.

485
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,802
Can't I be the only one you kiss?

486
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:35,113
We're just friends with benefits.
What more do you want from me?

487
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:41,425
Because I love you, Sher.

488
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:53,166
Get out and never come back.

489
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:59,709
From now on, you and I are nothing,
not even friends.

490
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:18,390
(Next Episode)
I saw you kissing Pai last night.

491
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,414
No, I...

492
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:23,694
Are you sure that it was me?

493
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:27,224
I don't like
that I can't get over Sher and Prince.

494
00:43:27,498 --> 00:43:28,756
Do you really love Sher?

495
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:32,366
If you're just sad that you lost him,
don't do anything.

496
00:43:32,923 --> 00:43:34,267
Why doesn't Sher come to me first?

497
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:37,793
Winning and prioritizing
are two different things.

498
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,538
Is it my fault
that I want to be special to him?

499
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:45,357
Yeah, if you're not important,
then the love is meaningless.

500
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,674
I gave you a chance,
but you chose not to take it.

501
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,238
You can only be my sex partner.

502
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:53,567
Sher, wait.

503
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:39,273
