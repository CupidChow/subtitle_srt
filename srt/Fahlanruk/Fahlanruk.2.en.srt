00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,425
(Previously)
He was holding a guitar.

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,803
He might be in the music club.

14
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:23,154
Is it the one he was carrying this morning?

15
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:25,568
This is crazy. I just met him this morning.

16
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,099
Fah. Are you here to meet someone?

17
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,521
Do you have a new boy?

18
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:30,732
No.

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,803
As for Tle, if I don't let him go,
he'll never leave me.

20
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,232
Changing the rehearsal venue?

21
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:36,670
Korb-lok Music Bar?

22
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,779
If I get drunk before the show,
don't blame me.

23
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,170
What was I thinking?

24
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,498
Fahlan.

25
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,131
We're going to Thonglor after.
Do you want to join us?

26
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:48,388
Go ahead. I already have plans.

27
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,306
Fah.

28
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:56,181
You're so late.

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,478
Love does not have a definite form.

30
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:05,486
We never know

31
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:07,236
when it's going to happen,

32
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:09,329
where it's going to happen or with whom.

33
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,923
That person might be someone you know

34
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:18,501
or a total stranger who suddenly shows up.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,946
The only thing that indicates
whether it is love or not

36
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:28,751
is our heartbeat that becomes different

37
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:32,088
when we meet that person.

38
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,478
(A different new friend)

39
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:43,307
Don't go home so quickly.

40
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,143
Please stay and watch the next band.

41
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:50,034
If you stay, I'll stay longer.

42
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,034
- Wow.
- Woah!

43
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,737
Of course I'm staying.

44
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,893
- I'm not leaving until I puke.
- Wow.

45
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,249
Let me go to the bathroom first.

46
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,322
- Come on. Let's drink.
- Okay.

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,411
Damn it.

48
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:45,168
You drank like you're heartbroken.

49
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:47,934
I'm not heartbroken.

50
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,067
Like I said,
I'm allergic to this alcohol brand.

51
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,567
Everytime I drink it, I get drunk immediately.

52
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,317
What an excuse. I know what you're up to.

53
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:01,809
- Does this mean we have to leave?
- Hey.

54
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,161
I'm fine.

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,574
Let me go wash my face. I can drink after.

56
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:07,848
Are you sure?

57
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:09,488
Yeah.

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,933
You ask too many questions.

59
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:33,892
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,877
I didn't think we'd meet again.

61
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,275
I'm glad.

62
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,380
I bumped into you this morning.

63
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:48,927
Now you bumped into me.

64
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,185
Well...

65
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:56,130
we're even now.

66
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,188
You're cute.

67
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,524
Don't you want to get to know
each other better?

68
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,616
Let's leave.

69
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,062
Please.

70
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,663
What the hell is wrong with you, Tar?

71
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,694
Now you want to leave.
You said you were fine.

72
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,316
I'm fine, but...

73
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:47,707
Shit.

74
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,801
I can still see that image.

75
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,401
What image?

76
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,613
Hold on.

77
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,457
You haven't told me your name.

78
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,278
So... how can I contact you?

79
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:19,163
That's not necessary.

80
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,819
This is just a one-night stand.
Don't you know it?

81
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:27,460
What's up with him?

82
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,624
Of course I know it.

83
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:44,587
- Come here.
- Hurry.

84
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,564
What's the matter with you, Tar?

85
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,627
Shh.

86
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:51,416
I saw Fahlan kissing a guy last night
at the bar.

87
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,673
Who was it this time? Who told you?

88
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,541
I saw them with my own eyes.

89
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:59,267
It was Sherbet, the Architecture major.

90
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:00,931
Really?

91
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:02,650
Fahlan and Sherbet?

92
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,439
If you saw them with your own eyes,

93
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,189
I'm sure you'll stop liking him.

94
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:15,244
Tar, thank you so much.
This is the best news.

95
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:18,837
All right.
I have to go find out about these two.

96
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,384
Hey, Pink.

97
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,188
Tar, where is Pink rushing to?

98
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,228
Did she forget that we have a meeting?

99
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,868
Well...

100
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:39,058
I saw Fahlan kissing Sherbet last night
at the bar.

101
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:41,277
So I told her about it.

102
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:44,316
Maybe now she'll stop obsessing over him.

103
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:46,308
Why does she seem so happy?

104
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:48,918
Tar.

105
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,644
Pink doesn't like Fahlan like that.

106
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:55,566
Now that she knows they kissed,
she's even more into him.

107
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:58,574
She wants Fahlan and Sherbet
to date so badly.

108
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,061
What the hell?

109
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,593
That's not necessary.

110
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,475
This is just a one-night stand.
Don't you know it?

111
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,934
Wait, wrong car.

112
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:06,833
Yes, wrong car.

113
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,333
What's up with you today?
You're distracted.

114
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:13,231
That's right.
I'm not going to eat hotpot with you.

115
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,629
You'll get us into a car accident.

116
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:19,036
We should find something to eat nearby.

117
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,268
Is there something you want to tell us?

118
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:26,635
Or...

119
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:28,260
is it something we shouldn't know?

120
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,073
But from what I see...

121
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,286
I think you should tell us.

122
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,059
- I want to know.
- Hey.

123
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:38,911
What, Tap?

124
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,887
I know you want to know too. Am I wrong?

125
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:45,239
Fine, stop arguing.

126
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:46,591
I'll tell you guys.

127
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,927
Then, let's go eat something first.

128
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:54,271
Looking at your distracted self,

129
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,404
this will be a long story.

130
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,459
Minding someone else's business

131
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:00,670
makes you smart, Ping.

132
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,459
I'll take that as a compliment.

133
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:06,498
Come on, let's go.

134
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:11,399
Fahlan is here.

135
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:23,394
Wow, they look so tasy.

136
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:25,683
This one, this one, and that one.

137
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:30,566
Of course, Wifey. Are you sure
you'll finish them before they melt?

138
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:33,871
Right, just the strawberry
and blueberry please.

139
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:37,788
Sounds so innocent.

140
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,248
You're right. I want to see his face.

141
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,694
Thank you.

142
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,647
- Take it.
- Hey.

143
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:53,092
Shit, Sherbet is with Prince.

144
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,797
It looks tasty.

145
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,515
Come here, hurry.

146
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:07,968
Don't.

147
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,625
Ew.

148
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,633
Who would want to eat this now?

149
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,164
Take it. I don't want it.

150
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:16,929
- Here, take it.
- Don't be like this.

151
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:19,265
Ew.

152
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,562
Damn.

153
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,351
- That's Sher.
- Look at this.

154
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:24,500
He's cuter in person.

155
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,070
Sher?

156
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,687
Fah just saw Sherbet
being sweet with Prince.

157
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,617
What's going to happen now?

158
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,374
Will he stop going after Sherbet?

159
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,163
Damn it.

160
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,983
My dream has been crushed.

161
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,835
Hey. Is the ice cream that good?

162
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:46,936
You have a smile on your face.

163
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:49,354
It's good.

164
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,370
I haven't had something like this
in a long time.

165
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,182
Eating something sweet makes me refreshed.

166
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,823
It's probably something else.

167
00:12:58,182 --> 00:13:00,573
I saw Fahlan calling you.

168
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:02,088
When did you start knowing him?

169
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:04,956
No, I don't know him.

170
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,159
I would have responded
if I knew him, Prince.

171
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,526
What's with the high voice pitch?
You're being suspicious.

172
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,716
What do you mean?

173
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:12,818
Why?

174
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,208
Are you jealous that some guy called me?

175
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,318
I'm not jealous.

176
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:18,919
If he wants you, just take it.

177
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,068
You're always drunk and self-centered.

178
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,451
You wake up late.

179
00:13:22,888 --> 00:13:23,888
You're a burden.

180
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,990
What about you? How do you know his name?

181
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:30,646
Are you dating him
behind my back, Silly Boo?

182
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:31,794
I won't tell you.

183
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,560
Find out if you want to know.

184
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,810
Tell me now, I'll punch him.

185
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,763
How dare he mess with my Prince.

186
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:41,201
- I won't tell you.
- Hey.

187
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,880
Tell me, Prince.

188
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,566
Silly Boo, come here.

189
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,656
What's wrong?

190
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,319
What happened, Pink?

191
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,027
My dream has been crushed.

192
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:18,042
Fahlan saw Sherbet and Prince being cute.

193
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,620
I'm so sad.

194
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,566
A perfect guy like Fahlan

195
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,151
will stop going after Sherbet.

196
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:38,873
Do you know those two?

197
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:42,889
I know Sher, why?

198
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,444
What is it, Fah?

199
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,944
Yeah, that's right. What's going on?

200
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,178
Why do you seem anxious?

201
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:53,905
Sher, who is Sherbet?

202
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:57,294
You really don't know him?

203
00:14:58,052 --> 00:14:59,521
He's so popular.

204
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
He just landed a spot
on the Cute University Boys page like you.

205
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:19,039
Sherbet, the junior
from the Architecture Department.

206
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:20,898
He's a singer.

207
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,422
He performs at Korb-lok Music Bar.

208
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:24,484
Sherbet.

209
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:26,297
His name is Sherbet?

210
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:28,609
Give it to me.

211
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:29,820
Hey.

212
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:35,977
Don't tell me that Sherbet is the reason
you've been distracted.

213
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:39,406
Tell us right now.

214
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,781
How did you know him?

215
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,004
- Don't tell us...
- Don't tell us...

216
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,629
Fine, I met him yesterday.

217
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,223
And...

218
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,364
- And what?
- And what?

219
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,367
I had sex with him.

220
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,835
But I didn't know his name.

221
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:00,796
I called him today.

222
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:02,773
He pretended not to know me.

223
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,132
So your confidence was shaken.

224
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:10,080
A little bit.

225
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,143
I don't think that's true.

226
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,080
He has you so distracted.

227
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:17,862
You've got it bad.

228
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,580
But Sher isn't ordinary.

229
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:25,533
I heard that
he's not looking for something serious.

230
00:16:26,994 --> 00:16:30,502
You can only be... his one-night stand.

231
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,455
I understand, Fah.

232
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:37,705
Everyone wants to date
a handsome and rich guy like you.

233
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:39,994
Both men and women.

234
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:44,182
But if what Ping said is true
and he pretended not to know you,

235
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:47,807
I think he's done with you.

236
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,018
Does he have a boyfriend?

237
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,096
What about the other guy?

238
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:55,705
Is that his boyfriend?

239
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:57,721
That's his Wifey.

240
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,900
Didn't you hear it?

241
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:04,728
But Sher is my Wifey.

242
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,541
Damn, he should have been single.

243
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:08,853
Hey.

244
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,010
But you have a Wifey too.

245
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,596
So what?

246
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,666
I'm a hot guy.

247
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,392
Would Sher not be interested?

248
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,314
Fah.

249
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:29,235
What did you do? Why do you look better?

250
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,173
Your acne.

251
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:34,610
Your rash.

252
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,845
They're all gone.

253
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:40,410
I found a great product.

254
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:48,574
Mer'Y. Try it.

255
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,008
Damn.

256
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:55,883
I just realized that your skin is smoother.

257
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,054
Yeah.

258
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,093
Let me try it.

259
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,292
Wow.

260
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,237
The texture is amazing.

261
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,362
What do you think? Am I more handsome now?

262
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:28,988
- Not that fast.
- Not that fast.

263
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,323
Put on more for better results.

264
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:52,233
Prince, you're here.

265
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:53,936
I'd called you a few times.

266
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,498
Really? I was in the library
and turned the notifications off.

267
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,990
What about Sher? Is he here with you?

268
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,272
He left.

269
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:08,334
He's going to
an old friend's birthday party tonight.

270
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,022
Well... where are you going?

271
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:13,264
Will you go study or go back to your dorm?

272
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:16,631
I'm going back, it's getting late.

273
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,779
I don't want to leave when it's dark.

274
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,717
- I'll take you home.
- It's fine.

275
00:19:21,006 --> 00:19:22,943
My dorm is so near. I'll walk.

276
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,983
Come on, I have to pass your dorm anyways.

277
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:27,951
Okay, fine.

278
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,568
Are you still thinking about Sher?

279
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,458
Or about Tle?

280
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,201
Or about both of them?

281
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:58,115
I think this is more about Sher.

282
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:01,142
Fah.

283
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:03,954
I think you should forget about him.

284
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,087
He pretended now to know you.

285
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:12,111
I think he's done with you.

286
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:16,689
He probably just wanted a one-night stand.

287
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:18,736
Ping.

288
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,447
Why?

289
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:22,305
Was I too direct?

290
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,375
Yes, you were.

291
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,281
Just wait and see.

292
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,430
I'll make Sher my boyfriend.

293
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:36,859
What about Tle?

294
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,148
Tle isn't the problem.

295
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,391
The problem is when do I get
to talk to Sher again.

296
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,289
He seems to be avoiding me.

297
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,039
Do you really like him
or do you just want to win?

298
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,740
What's the matter, Fah?

299
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,381
You don't seem as cheerful as you usually are.

300
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:12,040
Get me another bottle.

301
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:15,134
Okay.

302
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,382
You.

303
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,370
Do you come to places like this?

304
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:53,854
I'm a member here.

305
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:55,542
You're rich.

306
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,870
I only get to come to places like this
when I tag along.

307
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,987
I thought I wouldn't get to talk
to you again.

308
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:10,525
Do you come here often, Sher?

309
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:13,939
No.

310
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,213
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't necessary.

311
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,768
I don't like fancy places.

312
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,783
You just called me by my name.

313
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:26,103
How did you know?

314
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:28,158
Oh.

315
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,127
When you're interested in someone,

316
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,283
you pay special attention.

317
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,612
Isn't that right?

318
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:42,573
Why?

319
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:45,166
Are you hooked from last night?

320
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:50,494
Don't tell me that you aren't.

321
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,037
Your moans still echo in my mind.

322
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:01,358
It was just a one-night stand.

323
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,412
Also,

324
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:09,670
I moan like that with everyone.

325
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,811
You're not better than anyone.

326
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,823
Let me prove it again.

327
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,591
You're such a player.

328
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,323
If you're that horny,

329
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,675
help yourself then.

330
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:05,581
I'm not horny yet.

331
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:19,843
- Hey.
- No, it's not like that.

332
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:21,405
I was just tucking in.

333
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:39,771
Hey.

334
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:41,529
Hey.

335
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:44,568
What's wrong with him?

336
00:24:46,271 --> 00:24:47,045
What's wrong?

337
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:48,818
I don't know.

338
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:51,045
Let me prove it again.

339
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:57,125
Damn it.

340
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,922
- Hey.
- Hey.

341
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:04,484
What's the matter, Sher?

342
00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:06,992
Calm down, what's wrong with you?

343
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:13,988
Hey.

344
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,261
What's up with you, Sher?

345
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,683
That's enough.

346
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:21,243
You'll get fucked up before Tam gets here
if you drink like this.

347
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,214
I want to get drunk.

348
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:29,699
What's wrong with him?

349
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:31,972
Leave him alone.

350
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,737
Is everything okay, Fah?
You were gone for a while.

351
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,354
I had diarrhea.

352
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,497
Come sit down.

353
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,091
Have a drink.

354
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,523
Hey, Sher.

355
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:12,141
Where are you going?

356
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,257
You're so drunk.

357
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:18,336
You should wait for Tam to get here.
He'll take you home.

358
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,242
I'm not waiting.

359
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,783
Go wait for him. I can go home by myself.

360
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:27,087
Fine, up to you.

361
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,489
Aren't you waiting for your friends?
It's only 8 p.m.

362
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:40,458
I won't wait for them.

363
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:44,497
Hurry, I'm in a rush.

364
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:46,880
Okay.

365
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,246
Hello, Tle.

366
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:06,012
Don't wait up.
I don't know when I'm leaving.

367
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:07,152
I'll call you later.

368
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,923
Tap, do you want to sleep over?

369
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:36,291
It's already 8 p.m.
It'll be late when you get home.

370
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:40,884
Yeah, I'll sleep here.

371
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:42,798
I'm lazy to go home.

372
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:46,908
Go take a shower. You'll feel better.

373
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,722
Hey.

374
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,878
That's my towel.

375
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:07,863
I bought you a towel.

376
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:09,644
You never use it.

377
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,652
It's a waste. I'll just use yours.

378
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,363
So you don't have to wash more towels.

379
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,581
Come on, I don't sleep here every night.

380
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,331
Previously, yes.

381
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,972
But you rarely went home this year.

382
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:27,316
You left so many clothes in my closet.

383
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:31,261
Yeah, you're right.

384
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:34,503
I'm so sorry, man.

385
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:37,823
- I'll take my things home.
- Hey.

386
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:39,980
I didn't mean it like that.

387
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,159
I just don't want you
to use something I've used.

388
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,753
Well... don't worry about it.

389
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,425
Because I don't mind.

390
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:55,113
I think I'm dirtier than you.

391
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:14,105
Ping.

392
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,316
Let's go drink after my shower.

393
00:29:16,512 --> 00:29:17,574
I'm wide awake now.

394
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,105
I want to listen to some music.

395
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,004
Fine, hurry up.

396
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,738
If you're slow, I'll fall asleep.

397
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:43,699
You don't even know that
I bought some of these for you.

398
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:45,261
Stupid rabbit.

399
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:48,722
I'm done now.

400
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:51,761
Damn, you're done already?

401
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:54,988
- You're so fast when it comes to drinking.
- Of course.

402
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,425
Drinking makes my soul come to life.

403
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:03,613
Are all lightweights so bragful like you?

404
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:06,574
Probably.

405
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,574
Wait, you were taking a dig at me.

406
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,043
Come on, get dressed.

407
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,362
You're so drunk. Do you need a ride, Sher?

408
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:39,670
To your messy room?

409
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,224
Don't you like it there?

410
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:49,342
It reeks of your past lovers.

411
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,649
Stop calling me Sher.

412
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,141
We're not that close.

413
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,985
I see. I'm Fahlan.

414
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:02,102
And...

415
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,860
do you want to come?

416
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:08,829
Don't you think I drove here?

417
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,071
Of course you didn't.

418
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:17,665
You're so annoying, Fahlan.

419
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,728
(Korb-lok Music Bar)

420
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,923
I think Fah's been acting strange.

421
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,743
I've never seen him like this before.

422
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,001
Do you think

423
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:41,228
he just wants to win or is he serious?

424
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:46,392
I asked him that
because I also want to know.

425
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:51,149
He has so many lovers. It's hard to tell.

426
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,876
I don't know what he's thinking.

427
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,937
By the way, what about you?

428
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,249
You said you like someone.

429
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,937
Who is it? You never told me.

430
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:21,963
I'm so drunk, Tap. I just can't.
I need to sleep.

431
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:24,973
Ping.

432
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,692
Stop acting.

433
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,208
Tell me.

434
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,480
Even though your room is messy,

435
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:35,105
you smell really good.

436
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,171
Damn it, Fah.

437
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,726
Be gentle.

438
00:33:58,752 --> 00:33:59,603
Tonight

439
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:03,307
I'll make you moan
like you'll never forget.

440
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,432
Hurry up then.

441
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:14,029
Fah.

442
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:16,521
Fah.

443
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,008
Hey, don't get up yet.

444
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:47,293
Let's cuddle some more.

445
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:01,343
You would still be sleeping
if I hadn't called, right?

446
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,445
You can't skip class today.

447
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,874
The class is at 11.30 a.m.
It's only 7 a.m., Silly Boo.

448
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:09,163
Go take a shower then.

449
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:11,210
I'll get you some bread and juice.

450
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:13,437
I'll hurry, Wifey.

451
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,707
Silly Boo.

452
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:34,171
It suits him.

453
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,968
You can't call him Silly Boo.

454
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:40,968
I'm the only one who can.

455
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:44,179
He's really a Silly Boo.

456
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,273
He seems to be falling every four steps.

457
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,452
He's a polite and gentle person.

458
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,241
Unlike you.

459
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:56,265
Really, Wifey?

460
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,955
I'll take the chicken skin
if you don't want it.

461
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,463
I'll take you home after.

462
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:22,139
No, I live far away.

463
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:24,201
I went home by myself last time.

464
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:26,592
You drove last time.

465
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:28,639
I'll take you home after.

466
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:31,631
Don't take such good care of me.

467
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:33,791
I'm not your boyfriend, idiot.

468
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,955
- I'm just being kind.
- Yeah, right.

469
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:39,971
You're just horny.

470
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:43,369
You make me horny.

471
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:44,744
One more time?

472
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:47,223
That's enough.

473
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:51,848
Actually...

474
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,145
I don't want you to see my place.

475
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:00,547
Is that the reason?

476
00:38:02,937 --> 00:38:04,867
Why? What's the matter with that?

477
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,375
A fuck buddy and my private life...

478
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,211
I want to keep them apart.

479
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:17,643
May I sit with you, Prince?

480
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:18,987
Of course, Gear.

481
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,841
What about Sher?

482
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,904
Is he still not here?

483
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:35,138
Is he getting some food?

484
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:36,458
Sher?

485
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:38,357
He would still be sleeping
if I hadn't called.

486
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:41,169
I don't know
if he'll make it to class on time.

487
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:48,169
You don't like vegetables?

488
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,412
I'll eat them.

489
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,799
Here.

490
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,799
Take my fried egg.

491
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:01,564
No, it's okay.

492
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,658
- Just take it.
- Huh?

493
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:05,568
You gave me your vitamins.

494
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,318
Eat this egg for more protein.

495
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:36,636
A fuck buddy and my private life...

496
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:38,574
I want to keep them apart.

497
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,582
Sher.

498
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:51,280
You want to keep
a fuck buddy and your private life apart.

499
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:55,639
Does "private life" mean boyfriend?

500
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,204
If so,

501
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,400
I can be just a friend.

502
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:07,689
Friends don't sleep with each other.

503
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:10,572
Your logic is fucked up.

504
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:14,970
Friends with benefits.

505
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,876
Friends who fuck.

506
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:30,493
(Next Episode)
So, let's be friends.

507
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,727
Nice to meet you.

508
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:33,141
Friends with benefits.

509
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:35,368
Is Sher that great in bed?

510
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,618
Is that why you slept with him twice?

511
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:40,735
Do you guys think I'm in love with Sherbet?

512
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,360
Ask yourself.

513
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:45,243
If you love him, then keep going.

514
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:48,562
But if you're just looking for a fling,
I think you should back out.

515
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,000
You'll get hurt.

516
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:52,501
Aren't you upset that he likes men?

517
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:55,532
That's her happiness. It makes her happy.

518
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:59,869
How can you be so sure that
Fahlan and Sherbet will become a couple?

519
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:02,689
Because Sherbet never sleeps
with anyone twice.

520
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:08,080
We're so anxious to see
if Fahlan can win Sher's heart.

521
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,017
No one can replace you, Prince.

522
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:13,923
Come on, Silly Boo.

523
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:58,695
