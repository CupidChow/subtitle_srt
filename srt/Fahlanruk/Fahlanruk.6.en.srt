What the hell is wrong with you?

14
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:19,709
Tell me why you're mad.

15
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,114
I'm not mad at you.

16
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,779
I just think you're crossing the line.

17
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:27,383
This thing between us... Let's end it now.

Feelings are what keep people together.

00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:36,622
Am I really going to let it end like this?

21
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,253
I'm coming home late tonight.
I have a date.

22
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:41,144
You're going on a date.

23
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,828
You're dragging me there
to watch you flirt with some girl.

00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:45,254
Do you think I'll be having fun, Tap?

25
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:48,104
I'm sorry for being late, Tap and Ping.

26
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:50,660
It's fine. We just got here as well.

27
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,027
The bar is ten minutes from the dorm.
Why did we come here before it even opened?

28
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,158
Hey.

29
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,385
I met Sher at Korb-Lok Music Bar.

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,737
He seems wasted.

32

Time has told us many things.

33
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:16,539
Even though a situation might occur
for just a matter of seconds,

34
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:21,646
it can mean so much
and allow us to reflect on it

35
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:22,727
again.

36
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:31,788
Sometimes it makes us scared
to run into an unexpected situation.

37
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,921
We try to avoid it.

38
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:40,282
But it can change us for the better

39
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:44,609
in a way that
we've never expected or hoped.

40
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,012
This is especially true
when it comes to love.

43
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,128
Hey, Sher.

44
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:05,206
My friend will bring you the guitar.

45
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,202
It might not sound as good as yours,
but it should be fine.

46
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,704
Joke, I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:16,675
I shouted at you
because my friend was playing pranks on me.

48
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,942
I was annoyed. I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:23,683
Stop calling me.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

50
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,425
That wasn't Fah.

51
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,696
Shit.

52
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,631
That was Joke.

53
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,297
Hey, it's fine.

54
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,664
I have to thank you for playing tonight.

55

When Louis called about his car accident,
I called everyone.

56
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,235
No one was free to play in his place.

57
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,261
There's a table booked
for a birthday party tonight.

58
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:11,598
I'll leave it to you.

59
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,593
Don't worry.

60
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm willing to help you,
but let me get myself together.

61
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:21,479
- I'm so wasted.
- Okay. I understand. Thanks.

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,400
Fah.

64
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,741
Ping called saying you're here.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,013
You don't have your guitar.

66
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,377
So I went to get it for you.

67
00:04:59,079 --> 00:04:59,946
Thanks.

68
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:02,379
Hold on.

69
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,411
My band is performing soon. I have to go.

70
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,341
Cheers.

71
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:32,461
You seem shy unlike when we were texting.

72
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,831
When I'm with a beautiful girl,
my heart beats fast and I'm speechless.

73
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:46,506
You're handsome.
My heart is beating fast as well.

74
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:50,274
If you don't believe me, touch it.

75
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:52,470
So you'll know
how fast my heart is beating.

76
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:01,873
Ahem.

77
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:09,237
Hey, Fah.

78
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,706
You successfully dragged him here, Ping.

79
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:15,064
I didn't drag him. He's here on his own.

80
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,423
I just told him something.

81
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:21,518
You were in a hurry.

82
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,651
You didn't even change. What's wrong?

83
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:27,332
I just want a drink. Nothing's wrong.

84
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,057
I understand now.

85
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:40,979
You just want a drink, huh?

86
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,493
What do you want? Whiskey or beer?

87
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,199
I'll have what you guys are having.

88
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,083
Hello, Fahlan.

89
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:54,164
I'm Namwan.
I didn't think I'll meet you here.

90
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:57,316
I'll prepare the drinks for you.

91
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:02,160
Hello, I'm substituting tonight.

92
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,057
I heard there's a birthday party tonight.

93
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:08,304
If you don't dance,
I hope you're single all year round.

94
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,413
I think Sher has been acting strange today.

95
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,721
He's gone and won't pick up my calls.

96
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:24,398
You told me that sometimes he's alone
to write songs.

97
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:27,453
He might be doing that now.

98
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,587
But he always tells me first.

99
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,465
He's never gone this long.

100
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,178
You seem worried about him.

101
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:42,253
Yeah.

102
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,410
I have no other best friends beside him.

103
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:49,003
He always takes care of me.

104
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:52,293
When I have a problem,
he always takes care of it.

105
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,781
I'm such a bad friend.

106
00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:00,108
When he has a problem,
I can never help him out.

107
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:04,298
He always manages to take care
of his own problems.

108
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:11,315
I don't think he sees it that way.

109
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,522
Don't think like that, Prince.

110
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:20,317
We don't always want
someone who solves our problems.

111
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:24,883
We just need to know
that someone is there to support us.

112
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,633
That's enough.

113
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,702
Don't worry, Prince.

114
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:32,134
Sher will call you back.

115
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,355
Thanks, Gear.

116
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,043
You're always there for me.

117
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,581
You take me to the movies
and drink with me.

118
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:44,902
You make me feel

119
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,933
like I have another good friend.

120
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:51,509
But I'm still not the one he loves.

121
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,100
I want to thank you too

122
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,095
for allowing me to be there for you.

123
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,262
Drive safely.

124
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:22,776
That's enough, Fah. You're wasted.

125
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,853
The birthday party people
did not disappoint me at all.

126
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,947
I hope you're successful in love
and never be single again.

127
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,073
See you again, guys.

128
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,363
Where are you going?

129
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:55,406
You'll fall.

130
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,812
I'm going to pee.

131
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,421
Do you want to help me with that?

132
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,314
Do you think he's acting strange?

133
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,142
I've never seen him this drunk.

134
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,354
He didn't even change to come to a bar.

135
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,862
Have you seen him
not all dressed up to a bar?

136
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:30,981
Is he going to pee in front of the bar?

137
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,138
Sher.

138
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,396
Sher.

139
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:56,963
Sher, hold on.

140
00:11:58,955 --> 00:11:59,955
What's wrong with you?

141
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:02,538
You just don't want to talk to me anymore?

142
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:05,857
Tell me what I did wrong.

143
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:06,967
Don't avoid me like this.

144
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm fine. Let me go.

145
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:13,924
You're fine? Then why did you avoid me?

146
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:16,918
Right.

147
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,762
Is this about the pictures
on the Cute Boy page?

148
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,432
It has nothing to do with that.

149
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:29,837
I've told you that I'm bored.
What more do you want from me?

150
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,833
I don't believe you.

151
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,242
You said that we're friends.

152
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,152
I never said I'm going to stop
being your friend, Fah.

153
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:46,542
But what you're doing now

154
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,293
makes me feel
like you don't want me in your life.

155
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,418
Have you forgotten

156
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,627
that we're just having fun?

157
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:04,035
I don't like that you're being nice to me.

158
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,570
It makes me uncomfortable.
You're annoying, Fah.

159
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,433
Are you sure?

160
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,649
I think you're just scared.

161
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,673
You're scared of your feelings.

162
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:26,145
You're scared that you'll miss me
like I miss you.

163
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:28,043
That's why you're avoiding me.

164
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:34,835
It's strange.

165
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:37,558
It's only been a week,
but I've got it bad.

166
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,582
I've never felt like this with anyone.

167
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:49,393
I've slept with others
more than I have with you.

168
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:57,950
But I can't stop thinking about you, Sher.

169
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:12,777
Fuck you.

170
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:34,089
Stop saying you miss me
as an excuse to sleep with me, Fah.

171
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:38,609
It doesn't make me want to sleep with you.

172
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,968
I've told you that
I don't sleep with the same person.

173
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,898
Leave me alone.

174
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:06,112
What the hell?

175
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:23,165
Fah must have left.

176
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:32,165
Did you find him?

177
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,017
I think he probably left with Sher.

178
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:38,884
Let's go and take Namwan home.

179
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,983
You take her home. I'm sleepy.

180
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:47,551
Bye, Namwan.

181
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,463
- Get home safely.
- Hey.

182
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:51,324
Ping, hey.

183
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:55,113
I'm staying over at your place.
Why don't we go together, Ping?

184
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:58,418
What's wrong with him?

185
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,342
I don't live with my parents.

186
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:06,857
I'm staying at a dorm.

187
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,772
I can't stop thinking about you, Sher.

188
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,299
Stop saying you miss me
as an excuse to sleep with me, Fah.

189
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:55,291
It doesn't make me want to sleep with you.

190
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,503
I've told you that
I don't sleep with the same person.

191
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,444
Leave me alone.

192
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:12,887
(Chertame: Call me back now.)
Call me back now.

193
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,350
Damn it.

194
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,452
Why does it have to be like this?

195
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,693
Will I have a chance to be in his heart?

196
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:35,178
Damn it, Tap.

197
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:37,115
Why are you sleeping out here?

198
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,999
Fuck you, Ping.

199
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,298
I knocked so many times last night,
but you didn't open the door.

200
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:46,562
You're so drunk you didn't hear it.

201
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,754
I thought you would spend the night
at Namwan's.

202
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:53,044
Hey. I'm not that easy.

203
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:56,738
You didn't dare go to her place?

204
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:59,669
Or were her parents home?

205
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:03,034
She lives in a dorm. Get out of the way.

206
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:05,611
I need a shower. I feel disgusting.

207
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:07,949
That means

208
00:19:08,776 --> 00:19:10,206
he didn't sleep with her.

209
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,819
Hey. Hurry up, Tap.

210
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,762
I'm meeting Fah at the cafeteria.

211
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,051
I'm sorry.

212
00:19:53,688 --> 00:19:54,845
What's wrong with me?

213
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,181
Trust me. When Fah gets here,
he'll say the traffic was bad.

214
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:39,908
I think he woke up late
because he was drunk.

215
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:44,331
I saw Fah showering in the athletes' room.

216
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:45,865
He's so fit.

217
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:48,428
He was probably here since the morning.
He was wearing workout clothes.

218
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:50,736
See you around.

219
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,413
He was drunk. How could he be working out?

220
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,273
You said he left with Sher.

221
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,918
I was guessing because he was gone.

222
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:03,653
Sher was not in the bar.

223
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,487
I think something's off.

224
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,332
I'll ask him when he gets here.

225
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:25,591
Is that Chertame, Sherbet's twin brother?

226
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:29,125
I just saw his photo
in the Cute Boy page earlier.

227
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:32,165
He's a senior studying Medicine.

228
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:36,484
That means Sher is our age.

229
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,938
Why is he our junior though?

230
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:46,644
He was studying abroad,
but he came back to study here.

231
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:51,919
Can't his credits be transferred?
Why did he have to start all over?

232
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:55,519
I don't know.

233
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,269
That's all I got from the page.

234
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:03,356
If you want to know, ask him.
I'm not a nosy person.

235
00:22:03,704 --> 00:22:08,063
Come on, Ping. You're not nosy, huh?

236
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:12,948
You know everything I talk about.
Don't you sleep at all?

237
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:18,673
Hey. Are you not getting food?

238
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:20,454
I'm not hungry.

239
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,552
Fah.

240
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,755
Were you working out in the morning?

241
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,574
Why do you look so tired?

242
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:33,096
None of your business.

243
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,766
Your boy's twin brother
is sitting there alone.

244
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:39,821
Why don't you go say hi?

245
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,297
Why should I?

246
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,499
Well...

247
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,759
It's called family bonding.

248
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:50,343
Damn it, Ping.

249
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,108
Hey, Sher's here.

250
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,660
Tam, how could you do this?

251
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:04,170
So what are you going to do about it?

252
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,450
- Is this how you want to deal with it?
- Yes.

253
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:12,282
Sher.

254
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,630
You're hurting other people.

255
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,939
- Sher.
- That's enough.

256
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:20,872
- Take Tam away.
- That's enough.

257
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:22,222
That's enough. Come on.

258
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:31,530
Hey.

259
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:34,155
Why are you dragging me here, Tap?

260
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,390
Don't you see that your friend got punched?

261
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,250
Aren't you worried about him?

262
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:43,307
I saw him and I'm worried.
But we're not the ones he wants now.

263
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,444
You told Fah that
you saw Sher at the bar last night, right?

264
00:23:50,671 --> 00:23:52,727
- Yes.
- He came in his work out clothes.

265
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:55,202
But he usually has to dress up, right?

266
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,358
Yes, that's right. So what?

267
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,632
That means he had a fight with Sher.
That's why he was in a hurry.

268
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:07,752
He didn't go home or go with Sher.
That's why he came to shower here.

269
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,449
So why can't we go take care of our friend?

270
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,663
Because he needs some privacy with Sher
to make up.

271
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:22,022
I see.

272
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:23,756
Do you really understand?

273
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:27,752
Let's go, idiot.

274
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:37,874
I don't think he should wear a top
because he's playing a normal person.

275
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:39,607
Mak is supposed to be poor.

276
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:44,850
Also, Fahlan's body is a selling point.

277
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:46,731
- What do you think, Em?
- I agree.

278
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:48,315
Okay.

279
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:59,370
Do you know that Sherbet and his twin
are fighting in the cafeteria?

280
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,053
Fahlan helped and got punched.

281
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,202
- Fahlan got punched?
- Wait.

282
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:06,310
You don't have to go. They separated.

283
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,802
What about Fahlan and Sherbet?

284
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:15,578
They're both hurt, but Fahlan probably
took Sher to the nurse room.

285
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:22,296
Okay?

286
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,861
You're crazy.

287
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:35,911
You have everything in your car.

288
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:41,084
I'm just prepared. I'm an athlete.
These things are necessary.

289
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,031
I don't see other athletes carrying
all these things like you, Fah.

290
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:49,574
I have medicine too.
Do you want to see?

291
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:52,455
Fuck you.

292
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:03,242
Stay still.

293
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:08,565
What did you fight about?
Why did you punch him?

294
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:15,261
He was an asshole.
You shouldn't have stopped me.

295
00:26:17,148 --> 00:26:19,156
You're brothers. Why don't you talk it out?

296
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:26,650
Stop laughing. Your face is a mess.

297
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:34,721
Actually Tam called asking me to punch him.

298
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:39,619
He wants to get attention from his boy.

299
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,507
Is he dating someone?

300
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:46,106
I've never seen the guy.

301
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:48,522
But I think I'm right.

302
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,458
Or else he wouldn't have done this.

303
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:54,556
You shouldn't have dragged me out.

304
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,903
I want to see his boy.

305
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:02,000
You are the twins from hell.

306
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:07,216
Ouch.

307
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,895
And you still want to go to hell with me.

308
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,579
What should I do?
You took me to heaven first.

309
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:19,687
So I'll go to hell with you.

310
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:34,787
I'm sorry about last night.

311
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:41,688
Ouch, Fah. It hurts.

312
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:43,222
Hold on.

313
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,691
Ouch, it hurts.

314
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,591
Beg me nicely or I'll hurt you even more.

315
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,063
Ouch. It hurts.

316
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,103
- Just stay still.
- Fuck.

317
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:02,294
- It hurts even more.
- Stay still. Just a little bit more.

318
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,346
Thank you for helping with my wound.

319
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,121
Wow. You actually skipped class.

320
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,618
Why is Sher not here?

321
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:05,267
He went to check on Tam.

322
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,151
Huh?

323
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:09,620
They were trying
to kill each other earlier.

324
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:14,402
They're brothers.
They care about each other.

325
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:19,844
Yeah. So have you guys made up?

326
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:25,501
I can never hide anything from you.

327
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:29,822
Yeah, we made up.

328
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:35,702
What were you fighting about?

329
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:37,577
- None of your business.
- None of your business.

330
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:07,037
What is it? Why are you at my place?

331
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:14,027
I'm here to see you.
How are you after I punched you?

332
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,953
Don't pretend to care.

333
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:21,327
You just want to know
why I asked you to punch me.

334
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:28,543
Is he that important
for you to get hurt like this?

335
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:33,324
When you were chasing others,
you didn't have to go this far.

336
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:41,978
- My ex, Chama.
- Huh? When? Why do I not know this?

337
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,292
Before you moved back to Thailand,

338
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,308
Chama and I dated.

339
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:50,731
He disappeared one day.

340
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,275
When I saw him again,
he acted like he didn't know me.

341
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,202
I wondered about what happened.

342
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,183
You said you didn't know me.

343
00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:12,048
Why did you follow me but not say hi?

344
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,720
I wanted to know why
I have so many paintings of you at home.

345
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,248
I saw that you went to my place every day.

346
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,864
You cleaned and watered my plants.

347
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:30,719
I was not in Thailand for two years.

348
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:34,378
But it was like my house was never empty.

349
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,934
Did you really forget
or are you pranking me, Chama?

350
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,935
We used to date.

351
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,113
You promised me

352
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:52,877
that when you return

353
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:55,742
we'll be together.

354
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,603
I really don't remember.

355
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,962
That's why I enrolled here.

356
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:07,139
I followed you.

357
00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:09,278
Because I wanted to know

358
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:11,581
why you're important to me.

359
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:20,388
A memory loss?

360
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,680
Yeah.

361
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:25,180
Chama is an Architecture major.

362
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:29,772
He got into an accident
and lost some of his memories.

363
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,928
He lost memories about me.

364
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:39,010
Okay. It was worth getting hurt for.

365
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,850
I thought you said
you wouldn't punch me back.

366
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:45,413
I'm hurt, you asshole.

367
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,833
It was worth it for you.

368
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,600
You should thank me
that I punched you back.

369
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,172
You wouldn't have made up with Fahlan
if I didn't.

370
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:06,224
I was working out with a friend.

371
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:15,168
When I was in the bathroom,
I saw Fahlan wearing his workout clothes.

372
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:18,941
But I didn't see him working out.

373
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:28,570
He might went to work out somewhere else,
and came back to shower there.

374
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,410
My friend saw you fighting with him
at Korb-Lok Music Bar.

375
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:36,731
He was wearing the same clothes.
Don't lie to me.

376
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:39,116
Sher.

377
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:41,498
I think he really likes you.

378
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:47,625
He took the punch for you
after you treated him badly yesterday.

379
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,538
I want you to date him.

380
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:57,573
You'll not only be giving him a chance,
but you'll be giving yourself a chance too.

381
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,216
I've never seen you support
anyone like this.

382
00:34:02,872 --> 00:34:06,294
If you like him that badly, go date him.

383
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,738
Stop trying to change the topic.

384
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:13,032
I know that you like him too.

385
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:18,785
Don't let Dad's words about hating Mom
stop you from loving someone.

386
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:22,259
It doesn't mean
that you'll end up like him.

387
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,534
How can you be sure
that it won't end up like that, Tam?

388
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,589
I'm never sure how love is going to end.

389
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:33,606
But I believe that
everyone will experience their own love.

390
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:37,143
You don't need a role model
when it comes to love.

391
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,889
Sher.

392
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:28,817
I was going to call you.

393
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,950
Let's get some food. I'm hungry.

394
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:39,686
Okay, send me the location. See you there.

395
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,626
Hey.

396
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,962
The serum that Fah gave me
is really good.

397
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:04,491
- You think so too?
- Yeah. I'm running out.

398
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:07,156
Are you ordering? Do it now.

Order now.

401
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:21,516
I did.

402
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:25,938
Easy and fast delivery. All in one page.

403
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:31,523
Come on.

404
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:34,258
You're smiling from ear to ear.

405
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:37,947
You have to tell me now, Fah.

406
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,177
I won't let you go until you do.

407
00:36:41,728 --> 00:36:45,985
Tap, come help me.
If he doesn't tell me, I'll die.

408
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,907
If you guys don't let go of me,

409
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:55,855
I won't tell you.

410
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,301
Sher wants to see me.

411
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:11,043
He said he's hungry.

412
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:13,402
So I'm meeting him at our usual place.

413
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:16,362
That's it?

414
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:20,019
Why are you smiling about it?

415
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,250
Why does it make you happy?

416
00:37:23,978 --> 00:37:25,041
He just said he's hungry.

417
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:29,863
I'm happy that you're smiling, Fah.

418
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,769
Happy about what?

419
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:38,691
You guys know something,
but you're not telling me.

420
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:42,890
Tap knows as much as you do.

421
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:46,493
But he's smarter than you, idiot.

422
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:55,029
Sher wants to see him.
That means he's opening up to him.

423
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,844
You idiot.

424
00:38:00,026 --> 00:38:00,933
I see.

425
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,797
So what are you waiting for? Just go.

426
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:14,143
He wants to see me, not you.

427
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:16,813
You don't have to go.

428
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,685
Why are you laughing, Tap?

429
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:30,132
You'll see what an idiot like me can do.

430
00:38:33,763 --> 00:38:34,881
What are you going to do?

431
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:48,334
Being nosy makes people crazy.

432
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:57,951
Sher is scary.

433
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:02,148
He punched his own twin brother.

434
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:04,307
Are you scared of him?

435
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:06,268
I do, Prince.

436
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:12,415
I didn't dare talk to you before
because I was scared Sher'd punch me.

437
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,356
Then you're no longer scared.

438
00:39:18,744 --> 00:39:19,268
Yeah.

439
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,843
After finding out that you're not dating

440
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:26,608
and Sher allowing me to woo you
because he knows I like you...

441
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:52,886
Why did I say that?

442
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:54,811
Fuck.

443
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,867
Prince knows now.
Will he want to talk to me?

444
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:02,124
Damn it. Prince.

445
00:40:03,255 --> 00:40:06,576
If you didn't say it out loud,
how would I know?

446
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:15,133
Stop smiling. Your friends are waiting.

447
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,098
If I walk and smile at the same time,
will I look like a crazy person?

448
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,348
Then I'll walk and smile with you.

449
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,455
That's it.

450
00:40:40,342 --> 00:40:43,193
I said I was hungry.
Why did you take me to a hotpot place?

451
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,157
I ordered for you.

452
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:51,906
I know, but you're not
answering my question.

453
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,694
This is my usual place.

454
00:40:58,974 --> 00:41:00,419
I took you here

455
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:05,126
because I want you to know
that I want you in my life.

456
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:12,274
- Why are you smiling?
- Nothing.

457
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:18,178
If you don't tell me,
you know what I will do to you.

458
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:24,485
I was just amused
that you were trying to be emotional.

459
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:32,868
I'm glad that you felt like that.

460
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,938
Can I not eat? You're making me throw up.

461
00:41:48,062 --> 00:41:50,507
Eat up. You're hungry, right?

462
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:07,659
(Next Episode)
Fah told me that he's buying us drinks. Should we go to Korb-Lok Music Bar?

463
00:42:08,086 --> 00:42:10,118
Sure, we won't go home until we're completely wasted.

464
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,183
- I haven't had this much fun in such a long time.
- Hey.

465
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:17,835
Tap, you're burning.

466
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:20,550
Tap has a fever.

467
00:42:21,353 --> 00:42:23,853
Then take care of your boyfriend.

468
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm not his boyfriend.
Can Fah really tell?

469
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,281
