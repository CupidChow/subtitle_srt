00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,766
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,893
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,895
EPISODE 4

4
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,521
Once you're suspended,

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,191
there will be no once. It's just over.

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,817
Business suspension?

7
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,736
I can just open it again.

8
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,696
It's no big deal.

9
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,329
That's impressive.

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,916
It does sound like you, Park Saeroyi.
You haven't changed.

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,044
A naive rough-and-tumble amateur.

12
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,507
I understand you though.

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,051
You went to prison because of me,

14
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,804
you got expelled from school
because of me,

15
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,893
and you think your dad
died because of me, right?

16
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,439
My gosh.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,443
You know what?

18
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,784
You're right about that.

19
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,961
He's a middle school graduate,
an ex-convict, and an orphan.

20
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,505
Poor Saeroyi who ruined his life
because of me.

21
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,509
Gosh, I feel so bad for you.

22
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,853
-Jang Geun-won.
-Gosh. You sound scary.

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,313
My goodness.

24
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,609
Do you want to punch me?

25
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,153
Like you did before?

26
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,949
Go ahead and do it. You're good at it.

27
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,827
Assault.

28
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,002
Go ahead.

29
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,921
Hit me. Give me a blow.

30
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,756
Punch me. Just do it.

31
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,969
Aren't you going to hit me? Do it.

32
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,971
Go ahead. Hit me.

33
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,020
I guess you've grown up.

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,063
Good for you.

35
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,817
You want to make a living
with that tiny store.

36
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,986
You need to be patient, right?

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,075
Nine years.

38
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,915
I've been putting up
with it the whole time.

39
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,168
And I'll do it for another six years.

40
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,006
-What?
-I have a plan

41
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,216
for 15 years.

42
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,180
-What are you talking about?
-The statute of limitations.

43
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,646
Stubbornness and foolishness.

44
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,065
I'll show you what it's like.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,443
So you'd better

46
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,199
brace yourself.

47
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,467
What the hell is that moron saying?

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,392
What are you looking at?

49
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,477
Damn it.

50
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
Jeez, I got scared for no reason.

51
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,317
YONGGAK HIGH SCHOOL

52
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,654
So that guy's business
will get suspended, right?

53
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,780
Because of us.

54
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,950
Since when was he your buddy?

55
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,036
And the punishment we got

56
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,371
is writing a letter of apology
and running a few laps.

57
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,999
I have to say, he was right.

58
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,668
We're kiddies who can't even take
responsibility for what we did.

59
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,465
He didn't even get angry
when he knew about the suspension.

60
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,842
How could he be like that?

61
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,553
He's just a fogey who's full of himself.

62
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,680
What?

63
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,026
LETTER OF APOLOGY

64
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,203
He didn't even get angry
when he knew about the suspension.

65
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,330
How could he be like that?

66
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,335
LETTER OF APOLOGY
JO YI-SEO

67
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,805
DANBAM

68
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,479
You really didn't know?

69
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,775
I left it to you,
and you took them in on purpose.

70
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,818
What is it then?

71
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,611
It's our fault.

72
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,744
8 YEARS AGO

73
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,664
I'd like to properly introduce myself
to you, boss. I'm Choi Seung-kwon.

74
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
Hi, Seung-kwon.

75
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,586
Make yourself at home.

76
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,796
Yes, boss.

77
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,424
He looks like a smart cookie.
It'll be good to have him around, boss.

78
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,386
All the youngsters these days
look like that.

79
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:10,930
Hey, Saeroyi.

80
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,683
He's a year younger than you.
Take good care of him.

81
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
What's there to take care of?

82
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,522
That rude punk.

83
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,778
That was the first day I met him.

84
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,157
So this is your first time in jail?

85
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,658
Yes, boss.

86
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,202
It's not much different
from the outside world.

87
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,372
-If you have any questions, just ask me.
-Thank you, boss.

88
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,917
Well...

89
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,463
-Who is he?
-Who?

90
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,176
Oh, Saeroyi? He's a year older than you.

91
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,803
I hope you guys can get along,
like brothers.

92
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,389
But he was kind of rude to you.

93
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,516
Which gang does he belong to?

94
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,812
He comes across as rude and cocky,
but he's not one of us.

95
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,773
Don't get on his nerves
and get into a fight with him.

96
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,235
-Yes, boss.
-He's half mad.

97
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:13,993
What are you doing?

98
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,370
Reading.

99
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,080
What?

100
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,707
Why are you talking so casually to me?

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,709
I am reading a book.

102
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,379
-What kind of book is it?
-Got something to say to me?

103
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,340
No.

104
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,468
You read all the time,
so I was just curious.

105
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,720
There are many things
that I want to learn.

106
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,598
What for?

107
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,060
For people like us who come from nothing,

108
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,770
studying is of no use.

109
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,025
I may come from nothing, but there are

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,653
many things that I want to do.

111
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,030
But no one

112
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,116
will hire an ex-convict.

113
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,622
You don't think

114
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,042
you have a chance because
you're a poor, undereducated ex-con?

115
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,587
You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.

116
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,589
Why not decide after trying?

117
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,844
Your words sting.

118
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,305
Are you talking about me?

119
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,058
Are you lecturing me right now?

120
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,268
Of course not.

121
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,938
I'm just saying you shouldn't force me
to understand your logic.

122
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,440
You little shit.

123
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,027
Jeez, I really don't like your attitude.

124
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,946
Why are you such a stuck-up?

125
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,323
You're also an ex-con
who has failed in life.

126
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,283
So?

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,951
Is your life over?

128
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,330
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

129
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,416
Moron.

130
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,753
Okay, go on.

131
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,672
What will you do when you get out?

132
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,592
Work at construction sites?
Work on a fishing boat?

133
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,595
Inmate 2294!

134
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,264
-Cut it out!
-Who do you think you are?

135
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,933
Okay, I'm done.

136
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,776
Study? Do manual labor?
Work on a fishing boat?

137
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,695
I'll begin with all of that.

138
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,780
I'll do anything I need.

139
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,326
You have no right to determine my value.

140
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,661
My life has just begun!

141
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,914
And I'll do everything I want to do.

142
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,975
Time passes by.

143
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,777
-My gosh.
-Damn it!

144
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,488
Every day is the same.

145
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,490
Hey!

146
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,162
Come here!

147
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,168
And I was sick of it.

148
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,509
Like that...

149
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,677
DANBAM

150
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,012
...seven years passed by.

151
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,903
Boss, what are we doing at Itaewon?

152
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,532
A guy I know opened up a pub here.

153
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,826
It's only right that I bring my boys
for a few drinks.

154
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,954
Oh, right. Seung-kwon, you know him too.

155
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,998
-Pardon?
-Hee-hoon, over here.

156
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,961
My goodness, look at you.

157
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,713
-It's been so long.
-Have you been well?

158
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,673
Yes, I have.

159
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,426
I can't believe
you actually opened up a pub.

160
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,679
My gosh, I'm sure this cost you
a lot of money.

161
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,141
Everyone

162
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,935
is given the same amount of time.

163
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,147
You know Seung-kwon, right?
You should say hello.

164
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,942
Have you been well?

165
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,656
But I realized that the depth of the time

166
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,034
he and I had spent

167
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,997
are completely differently.

168
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,672
Why do you come here to drink every day?

169
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,468
Why? Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

170
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,804
Are you kidding?
You're helping me increase my sales.

171
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,557
Why are you so busy?
There are no customers.

172
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,476
Join me for a drink.

173
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,317
You always come alone these days.

174
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,360
Is something bothering you?

175
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,283
No, not really.

176
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,411
I just enjoy watching you work here.

177
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,538
What?

178
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,290
I'm your fan.

179
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,044
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,049
I'm just impressed.
You're doing what you want.

181
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,595
I want to live a proper life like you.

182
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,393
What's a proper life?

183
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,770
Not doing bad things

184
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,189
and working diligently.

185
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,235
I remember the day we first met.

186
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,322
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

187
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,407
Moron.

188
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,118
Are you still a moron?

189
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,425
I'm such a fucking moron.

190
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,521
What's wrong with him?

191
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,581
PARK SAEROYI

192
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,249
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

193
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,130
DANBAM

194
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,256
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

195
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,176
I guess he just ignored what I said.

196
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,346
Oh, no.

197
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,932
He got expelled before graduation.

198
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,059
So we aren't technically alumni.

199
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,855
He was in high school ten years ago.

200
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,152
Jang Geun-won.

201
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,908
JANG GEUN-WON

202
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,747
ELDEST SON OF JANGGA CO. GETS ASSAULTED

203
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,374
POLICE ARRESTS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER

204
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,088
You think your dad
died because of me, right?

205
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,426
"Attempted murder."

206
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,261
"Previous conviction."

207
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,564
Ms. Kang seems to be
meeting the stockholders these days.

208
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,109
Her father and I were friends
for 40 years.

209
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,737
She's like a daughter to me.

210
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,073
That's why you should be more careful.

211
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,699
Don't you remember who built Jangga Co.?

212
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,326
It was you and Mr. Kang.

213
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,413
The company could've been hers.
I'm sure she gets tempted at times.

214
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,457
That's enough.

215
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,543
I already have a plan of my own.

216
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,421
Okay.

217
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,465
By the way,

218
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,843
remember how Geun-soo recently got caught

219
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,679
drinking at a pub?

220
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,138
Do you know

221
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,057
who the owner of that pub is?

222
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,311
It turns out,

223
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,021
it was Saeroyi's pub.

224
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,864
His business got suspended for two months.

225
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,952
He probably saved up
really hard for seven years

226
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,706
so he could finally open up that tiny pub.

227
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,875
He won't have the money to maintain it.

228
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,128
He's done.

229
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,718
Atari.

230
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,180
You're finally pretty good.

231
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,057
No, I still have a long way to go.

232
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
Leave it. I want to take a look.

233
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,395
Okay.

234
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,314
I have to say, I feel bad.

235
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,445
He's suffering because of my family again.

236
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,157
Business isn't for everyone.

237
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,783
I'll be off now.

238
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,628
He should've drawn a bigger picture.

239
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,088
Pardon?

240
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,759
The borderlines are too weak
because he focused too much on the center.

241
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,886
I wouldn't call this a good game.

242
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,641
Mr. Kim.

243
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,393
Yes, sir.

244
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,479
How is Geun-soo doing these days?

245
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,981
Welcome.

246
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,323
It's not like I want to fire him either.

247
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,742
But the minimum wage
is going to increase next year.

248
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,787
So you want me to fire him
even though he works so hard?

249
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,246
What about his severance pay?

250
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,791
What severance pay?

251
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,667
No one hires
high school students these days.

252
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,462
We were nice enough
to give him a job in the first place.

253
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,049
We're not paying for his insurance,
and we didn't even write up a contract.

254
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,384
You're unbelievable.

255
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,930
You should be mean to him from now on
so that he'll quit on his own.

256
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,142
What a joke.

257
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,729
I can't wait to see your frowning face

258
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,856
with your business closed down.

259
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,611
One, two, three, four

260
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,585
The business suspension starts tomorrow.

261
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,920
How exciting.

262
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,090
I'm not like other men
I will call you first

263
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,300
You know it's because of you, right?

264
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,386
Yes, I know.

265
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,265
I'll go see you long as you want me there

266
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,726
I'll run to you and fly to you

267
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,063
I'll embrace you
and give you everything I have

268
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
-Don't ever do that again.
-Bounce with me

269
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,571
-Okay.
-Bounce

270
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,365
Call me when you're lonely

271
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,075
What's stopping you?

272
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,288
You know I want you

273
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,707
-Just cancel the song.
-I want you

274
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,042
-I really can't stand this.
-I'll run to you

275
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,340
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:39,970
So tell me.

277
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,639
How long are you going to be like this?

278
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,516
It's in the past. It can't be undone.

279
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,435
How should we handle this?

280
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,770
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,023
I'll fire you if you apologize
one more time.

282
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,486
That's great. Hurry up and apologize.

283
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,241
Here.

284
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,080
A two-month suspension.

285
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,375
Let's think of it as a chance
to improve what we lack.

286
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,252
-Okay, Saeroyi.
-Okay.

287
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,298
Now, let's not stop the fun.
Where should we go next?

288
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,549
-Another karaoke room?
-No.

289
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,471
Do me a favor. Please don't sing.

290
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,936
Do you want to get fired?

291
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,981
I was so shocked at the recent meeting.

292
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,777
-Because the chairman slapped Geun-won?
-Yes.

293
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,697
He's never treated his son that way
regardless of how immature he was.

294
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,283
I was really startled as well.

295
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,786
It's probably because
Geun-won caused trouble recently.

296
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,163
Our stock price plummeted because of that.

297
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,498
Don't even get me started.

298
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,709
I still get angry
every time I think of that.

299
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,253
Geun-won has been quiet for a while.

300
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,465
But he recently started going around
telling people that he's the heir again.

301
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,926
So he just helped him get to his senses.

302
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,971
This proves that raising kids
is the hardest thing in life.

303
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,389
I wouldn't know.

304
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,184
But I'm worried.

305
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,021
The chairman is old now.
He's not clear-headed as he used to be.

306
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,441
Plus, his one and only child is a mess.

307
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,567
He's right.

308
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,861
The executives are very concerned.

309
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,406
They think we should start preparing soon.

310
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,659
-Prepare?
-For the succession.

311
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,412
You're the best person for the job.

312
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,957
Yes, of course.
He can't leave the company to that fool.

313
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,835
Then we'll go bankrupt.

314
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,464
There's no need to feel pressured.
We just want you to know

315
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,177
how we feel about you.

316
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,431
Do you think the chairman
will let that happen?

317
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,391
Aren't you scared?

318
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,270
Why would we be scared?

319
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,438
He's right.

320
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,151
If you agree with our plan,
we'll support you all the way.

321
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,612
Do you have the guts
to fight the chairman?

322
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,783
And that's not even the issue.

323
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,286
You think he's not as clear-headed?

324
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,371
Do you really think

325
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,790
the company will run fine without him?

326
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,086
Ms. Kang, please don't get the wrong idea.

327
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,796
I'll pretend like I didn't hear anything.

328
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,217
I'm not very satisfied
with Geun-won either.

329
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,971
But I'm too young to be used
as your cannon fodder.

330
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,099
My goodness.

331
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,393
That's not what we meant, Ms. Kang.

332
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,151
DANBAM

333
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,203
THE PUB WILL BE CLOSED FOR TWO MONTHS

334
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,919
Hello, please show us your IDs first.

335
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,180
Twenty years old.

336
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,767
I got accepted
to all the universities I applied for.

337
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,230
I turned 20 as of January 1st,
and I'm bored.

338
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,400
Here's why I hang around
with these dumb brats.

339
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,235
Her dad is a chief prosecutor.

340
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,612
Her dad owns a clothing company.

341
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,240
I only befriend people

342
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,660
when they have something I want.

343
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,329
Hi.

344
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,874
Hello.

345
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,710
The food you ordered looks very delicious.

346
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,045
Will you let us join you ladies?

347
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,090
We'd like to treat you.

348
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,847
Sure.

349
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,974
BOGWANG KOSIWON
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

350
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,204
Congratulations on turning 20.
What are you up to later?

351
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,706
She hasn't even read it yet.

352
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,055
The rent is 300,000 won with no deposit.

353
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,099
The dorm is about 4m² big.

354
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,893
Why don't you say hello since we're here?

355
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,233
-Let's just go.
-Okay, sir.

356
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,533
Three male strangers.

357
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,912
I'm starting to get really annoyed.

358
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,458
This fool is desperate for attention.

359
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,586
This jerk is just horny.

360
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,672
And he's just thoughtless.

361
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,008
I don't have anything against hook-ups.

362
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,388
Whether it's to fulfill your loneliness,
desire for sex, or boredom,

363
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,057
it's just something people do

364
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,185
to satisfy their own desires.

365
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,480
It wouldn't be so bad

366
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,774
if they fulfill each other's needs.

367
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,153
But I don't want anything from these guys.

368
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,074
I'm so bored.

369
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,035
I wonder why.

370
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,212
Are you all right?

371
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,511
Ever since I met that guy,

372
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,223
I can't seem to find interest
in anything else.

373
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,857
Hello.

374
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,662
-Hi.
-Sweetheart.

375
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,499
I heard your pub got suspended
for selling alcohol to minors.

376
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,543
Well, yes.

377
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,339
How unfortunate. You should be
making money during this time of year.

378
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,966
-You're so unlucky.
-Why are you rubbing it in?

379
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,719
What are you talking about?
I heard someone called the police.

380
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,554
I'm just angry at whoever did that.

381
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:22,932
It's okay. Thanks to that,
I'm able to take some time off.

382
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,434
You're so positive.

383
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,187
What would you like to drink?
It'll be on the house.

384
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,023
-Really? Then I want...
-Hey.

385
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,775
You need to pay.

386
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,153
Only guys get free drinks.

387
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,783
I'm jealous.

388
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,540
Your friends look drunk.

389
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,794
Yes, I know.

390
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,132
How about we go get some ice cream
to sober up a little?

391
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,218
Yes, you should go.

392
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,387
We'll make sure your friends stay safe.

393
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,347
What a joke.

394
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,395
No, it's okay. I'm going to go now.

395
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,859
-Yi-seo.
-Let me warn you just in case.

396
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,987
Her dad is a chief prosecutor.

397
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,324
Don't let your momentary desire
get you locked up in jail.

398
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,252
This reminds me of when we were younger.

399
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,839
What?

400
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,843
You used to like me
back when we were in high school.

401
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,761
I still do.

402
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,058
Whatever. Are you drunk?

403
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,105
I'm just saying.

404
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,192
You always end it so vaguely.

405
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,071
Come to think of it,
you never really asked me out.

406
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,409
Are you toying with me?

407
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,244
That's absurd.

408
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,374
It's just that we both
prioritize our jobs.

409
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,003
And once my business goes well,

410
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,674
you'll end up losing your job.

411
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,222
It'd be fun if I asked you out...

412
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,395
What's the straight face for?
I didn't mean it.

413
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,694
Don't lie to me.

414
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,031
You never say things you don't mean.

415
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,575
It's okay.

416
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,952
If I become jobless,

417
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,872
I wouldn't exactly
be able to help you out.

418
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,459
But I'd still cheer for you.

419
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:08,556
Yi-seo, wait. Where would you go
without public transportation?

420
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm going to take a taxi.

421
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,976
You know it's impossible
to get a cab in Itaewon.

422
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,771
I'll keep you company
until the buses start running again.

423
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:15,730
You should stay.

424
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,775
Gyeongridan Street is this way.

425
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,401
I can grab a cab there.

426
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,987
Why are you suddenly leaving?

427
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,948
Don't you like me?

428
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,244
No, I don't.

429
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,120
Why?

430
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,331
What don't you like about me?

431
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,669
Your face, the way you talk, your voice,

432
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,421
your pupils, teeth, eyelashes,

433
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,090
pupils...

434
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,716
Did I say that already?

435
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,886
I don't like anything about you.

436
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,097
Bye, then.

437
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,393
Hey, wait.

438
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,230
What a fucking joke.

439
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,857
Are you crazy?

440
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,025
Then why did you drink with us?

441
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,820
Do you know how much I spent on you?

442
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,449
You must feel like you wasted your money
since you spent your entire fortune

443
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,577
trying to score tonight.

444
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,874
You can keep the change.

445
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,255
-Hey, stop.
-Will you just...

446
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,802
Why? What's wrong?

447
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,472
Acting like a bitch like that
can get you hurt.

448
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,975
Who do you think is going to help you now?

449
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,607
Myself.

450
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,152
My gosh.

451
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,279
You messed with the wrong person.

452
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:49,240
You think you're so pretty that
you can treat me like this?

453
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,743
Let me teach you a lesson.

454
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,963
What a fucking loser.

455
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,968
Hey.

456
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,929
Stop right there.

457
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,140
Hey, stop. Hey!

458
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:19,979
UNDER REPAIR

459
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,105
This is so annoying.

460
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,199
You're dead.

461
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,548
You little...

462
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,932
-Hey.
-Get off me.

463
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,558
You little...

464
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,744
Come with me while I'm being nice.

465
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,414
-Let me go.
-Hey.

466
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,586
Hey.

467
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,966
-Yes?
-Well...

468
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,679
Don't let her bother you.
I need to talk to my girlfriend.

469
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,807
What? I'm not your girlfriend.

470
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,600
Hey.

471
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,478
Don't be like this.

472
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,481
You can go. She's just drunk.

473
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,995
Your cheek is swollen.

474
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,458
We had a small incident.

475
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,252
If you're done, you can leave.

476
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,007
I'd love to leave,
but I can't help but feel bothered.

477
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,762
I'm wondering why her cheek is swollen

478
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,598
and why she's looking at me like that.

479
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,309
You see, I know her.

480
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,313
What's your problem?

481
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,816
Stop being nosy and just get out of here.

482
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,403
You tell me.

483
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,532
-What?
-If I meddle in here,

484
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,284
does that mean I'm nosy?

485
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,662
You crazy bitch.

486
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,000
Hold on.

487
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,503
How nosy.

488
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,633
I can't do anything

489
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,635
if you stay quiet.

490
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,058
Okay.

491
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,852
Help me.

492
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,148
Okay, let's go.

493
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,822
Who do you think you are?
I told you to get lost.

494
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,700
My gosh.

495
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,538
You fucking jerk.
Do you have a death wish?

496
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,380
Damn it.

497
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,351
-Soo-ah!
-What?

498
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,186
-Run!
-Wait!

499
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,523
-What's going on?
-Just run!

500
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,128
What was that? What's going on?

501
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,590
What is going on?

502
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,469
He just saved me from some crazy jerk.

503
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,556
I know you're a pushover,

504
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,142
but were you running around
just to help her?

505
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,979
What?

506
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,314
Do you know her?

507
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,775
What?

508
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,032
No.

509
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,451
How would I know her?

510
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,287
I'm just upset
that you only care about others.

511
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,623
Let's go.

512
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,127
What do you think?
Do you want to call the police?

513
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,255
I'm fine.

514
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,631
Are you not hurt?

515
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,717
I got a good slap in the face.

516
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,261
It really hurts.

517
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,221
Well...

518
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,307
You should go see a doctor.
Take care then.

519
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,646
Thank you.

520
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,106
We should get going then.

521
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,024
Wait.

522
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,652
I'd like to repay your kindness.

523
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,821
It's okay. You must be startled.

524
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,155
Just go home and get some rest.

525
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,365
No.

526
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,034
I don't like to feel indebted.

527
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,746
Would you like some coffee?

528
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,918
Hey, he says it's fine.

529
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,004
You're making him feel uncomfortable.

530
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,216
It's really fine.

531
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,844
Just go home.

532
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,641
You seemed interested
in promoting your pub before.

533
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,021
I'd like to give you some tips.

534
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,856
It's my thing.

535
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,463
Well...

536
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,298
So you said it's your thing.

537
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,008
You must have an interest in advertising.

538
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,384
Yes.

539
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,471
I earn my pocket money with promotion
on social media and websites.

540
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,057
What's the relationship between you two?

541
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,100
-What?
-We're friends.

542
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,229
-I see.
-But

543
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,398
Saeroyi likes me.

544
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,113
It's been about ten years, right?

545
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,115
What?

546
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,328
Oh, I'll go get the coffee.

547
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,337
So you're famous on social media.

548
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,798
I thought you were familiar.

549
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,760
I saw you on the list of
social media models for Jang's Family Co.

550
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,512
Really?

551
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,097
Why did you not hire me?

552
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,558
But I don't understand
why you're hitting on a guy like him.

553
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,814
Do you

554
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,942
like Saeroyi?

555
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,862
Do I like him?

556
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,574
I guess I am hitting on him.

557
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,536
But I'm not sure if I like him.

558
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,579
I'm interested though.

559
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,915
Saeroyi is attractive.

560
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,042
But

561
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,963
he's not someone
whom a girl like you can deal with.

562
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,176
A girl like me?

563
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,761
What do you mean?

564
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,139
Well...

565
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,851
Those with a sheltered life
who think that the world

566
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,644
revolves around them.

567
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,400
I guess you think you know
who I am through my social media.

568
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,486
I can't deal with him?

569
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:53,033
Are you talking about the criminal record
of attempted murder?

570
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,830
Are you hitting on him knowing all that?

571
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,248
It makes him more attractive.

572
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,090
You're young, but it's not cute
when you have no sense of shame.

573
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,554
His pub is suspended because of you,

574
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,056
but you don't seem sorry at all.

575
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,940
I know you're a pushover,

576
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,067
but were you running around
just to help her?

577
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,027
What?

578
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,778
Do you know her?

579
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,199
What are you looking at?

580
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,493
How did you know?

581
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,329
We're friends. We know stuff.

582
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,081
You got caught drinking there.

583
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,084
He has to pay the rent
with the store closed for two months.

584
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,961
Do you even know how much the damage is?

585
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,129
No.

586
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,132
He is suspended because of me.

587
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,218
How do you know that?

588
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,889
-What?
-I thought it was strange.

589
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,684
He didn't tell you about me.

590
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,772
But why do you think
he's suspended because of me?

591
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,817
-That's...
-Well...

592
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,987
Is it you

593
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,742
who called the police?

594
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,415
What?

595
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,125
Why aren't you saying anything?

596
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,293
You should deny it.

597
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,088
You'd never do that to your friend.

598
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,173
If he's suspended,

599
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,384
he has to suffer a lot of damage.

600
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,018
So it's true.

601
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,276
I must have some supernatural powers.

602
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,529
-You...
-I'm curious though.

603
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,240
Why?

604
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,660
Because his pub is across from yours?

605
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:04,832
Is that why you stabbed your friend
who's liked you for ten years in the back?

606
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,170
That's unbelievable.

607
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,550
So what are you up to?

608
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,553
You still want to
have a barrier around him.

609
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,638
You can't let others have him.

610
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,106
You know what?

611
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,152
There's no way you can have him.

612
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,698
-Why?
-Because that's who Saeroyi is.

613
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,908
He won't change.

614
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,876
But if he finds out what you did,

615
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,045
he might change a little.

616
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,091
Don't worry.

617
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,428
Like I said, I'm just a little interested.

618
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,868
What's wrong with you two?

619
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,952
Did you guys fight?

620
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,413
No. Why would we fight?

621
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,249
She's really something.

622
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,585
How would I win against her?

623
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,052
Saeroyi.

624
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,515
The person

625
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,059
who reported your pub to the police.

626
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,107
It's me.

627
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,990
Do you still like me?

628
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,039
Yes.

629
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,336
There must've been a reason.

630
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,673
I don't know anything
as long as you don't tell me.

631
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,427
I'm just a little

632
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,887
disappointed.

633
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,109
I should get going.

634
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,447
Are you all right? You don't seem fine.

635
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,536
See you.

636
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,048
Shall we go now?

637
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,760
You said you're interested
in promoting your pub.

638
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,847
As of today, I've come of age.

639
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,433
I guess it's a perfect time
to grab a drink.

640
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,643
What do you think?

641
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:33,290
You said you wish me happiness
for now and always.

642
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,668
But this very sentence in your letter

643
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,087
meant a lot to me.

644
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,175
There's no way I can resent you.

645
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,429
You're just living your life.

646
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,390
And I'm always grateful.

647
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,371
It's so annoying.

648
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,047
You just went through something terrible.

649
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,466
Shouldn't you get some rest at home?

650
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,927
I'm fine.

651
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,471
We met again like this.

652
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,519
Aren't you upset?

653
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,065
-What do you mean?
-A friend whom you liked for ten years

654
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,650
just betrayed you.

655
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,068
Betray?

656
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,615
I'm not sure if I can call it a betrayal.

657
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,284
She didn't say much,

658
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,786
but I think I know why she did that.

659
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,914
It's just that she's committed

660
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,333
to her job and her life.

661
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,712
You sound so generous like Gandhi.

662
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,506
"I've liked you for ten years,

663
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,842
so you have to like me back."

664
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,760
This isn't about business.

665
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,847
Feelings aren't like a give-and-take deal.

666
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,016
Gosh.

667
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,310
I don't want to talk about her.

668
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,327
-What are you doing?
-What brings you here?

669
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,996
I need to organize the ingredients
when I have time.

670
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,164
What were you doing here?

671
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,915
I'm here to clean up.
I was a little bored.

672
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,710
Do you even have time to feel bored?

673
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,087
Actually, I'm glad you came.

674
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,050
I'm soaked in sweat.
Let's go to the sauna.

675
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,719
-What?
-I'll pay.

676
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,970
Help me scrub my back.

677
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,806
Are you crazy?
Why would I scrub your back?

678
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,516
What's not to like about it?

679
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,976
I'll scrub your back too.

680
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,771
I'm not going.

681
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,484
What?

682
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,947
What are you looking at?

683
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,786
I guess you don't have confidence.

684
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,288
What?

685
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,123
Nothing.

686
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,296
It's not just about size.

687
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,009
Go by yourself, you crazy idiot.

688
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,642
My gosh.

689
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,604
How did you start your pub?

690
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,147
I just

691
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,525
worked hard and saved money.

692
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,655
And you've never worked at a pub before?

693
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,825
How did you know?

694
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,868
I could tell from the place.

695
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,372
Your pub has bigger issues than promotion.

696
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,374
Like what?

697
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,458
Everything.

698
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,963
You don't have the basics.

699
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,340
The basics?

700
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,510
The most important thing
is to stick to the basics.

701
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,056
Can you be more specific?

702
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,518
I bet you've been doing this
only with your passion.

703
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,437
The interior design is tacky,

704
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,564
and the employees seem dull.

705
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,442
The place has no character, nor basics.

706
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,237
How would it go well?

707
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,781
How do you know all this stuff?

708
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,450
You just turned 20.

709
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,617
I told you I make pocket money

710
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,327
by promoting stuff
on social media and websites.

711
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,581
Eating shows and restaurant reviews
are lucrative contents.

712
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,332
Once I get the hang
of the basic principles,

713
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,752
there's a thread of connections
between things.

714
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,508
You're impressive.

715
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,266
Drink it.

716
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,477
I think I should stop here.

717
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,103
I drank too much.

718
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,940
You can really hold your liquor.

719
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,776
I'm feeling good today.

720
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,696
It's sweet.

721
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,244
That means you had

722
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,164
a very impressive day today.

723
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,295
The pub's name is a problem.

724
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,463
DanBam?

725
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,716
-What's wrong?
-It's just lame.

726
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,510
It doesn't suit Itaewon.

727
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,720
Why did you choose that name?

728
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,938
My life

729
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,273
is a little

730
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,776
bitter.

731
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,989
It's just too bitter.

732
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,160
I can't sleep well at night.

733
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,871
I feel nostalgic,

734
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,499
lonely,

735
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,168
and upset.

736
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,721
So my job is cut out for me.

737
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,266
There's no other reason.

738
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,518
It's just...

739
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,480
I want

740
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,358
my bitter night

741
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,570
and my life

742
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,160
to be sweet.

743
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,957
There it goes again.

744
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,960
My heart

745
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,464
feels strange.

746
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,473
Am I drunk?

747
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,393
I'm talking too much.

748
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,064
I should stop drinking.

749
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,033
Now, I'm

750
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,578
not drunk at all.

751
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:34,127
This guy with a buzz cut
just sprawled out drunk.

752
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,630
But he looks cute.

753
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,884
This is awkward.

754
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,306
He says his night is bitter,

755
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,225
but I want it to be sweet.

756
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,895
I want to make

757
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,065
his life sweet.

758
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,277
The feeling I have now

759
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,950
is the most foolish thing
that a human being can do.

760
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,953
And I can't

761
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,915
hold on to this impulse.

762
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,794
Do you like Saeroyi?

763
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,932
I like him.

764
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,410
Gosh, it's a hospital room.

765
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,501
That was a dangerous dream.

766
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,348
Gosh, I feel much better now.

767
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,270
You've been staying out a lot these days.

768
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,564
It's how a 20-year-old should act.

769
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,150
You said just studying hard
won't help me find a good guy

770
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,776
and that I should also know
how to have fun.

771
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,819
So?

772
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,738
Are you seeing someone?

773
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,533
-Why do you ask?
-Don't.

774
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,286
Guys whom you date at your age
are just useless.

775
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,917
I've always been curious.

776
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,712
Why did you marry Dad?

777
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,380
Because I loved him.

778
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,633
-That's surprising.
-I was serious.

779
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,260
I mean, back then.

780
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,722
Why did you get divorced?

781
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,308
A person's feelings can be

782
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,185
very shallow.

783
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,520
They change depending on the situation.

784
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,939
After you were born, I got sagging skin

785
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,691
and more wrinkles.

786
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,863
Are you saying it's because of me?

787
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,823
I wanted to be a woman

788
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,786
who's always loved
instead of a mother of a child.

789
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,289
So I got divorced. It's simple.

790
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,916
I guess you regret

791
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,001
meeting Dad.

792
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,920
Not really.

793
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,464
Two years of dating
and seven years of marriage.

794
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,175
It was a short period of time
less than ten years.

795
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:30,095
But I loved him and he loved me.

796
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,181
It's like the completion of youth.

797
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,559
Without those memories,

798
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,270
I don't have anything left
for my life as a woman.

799
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,150
Like you did,

800
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:48,196
what if I fall in love with a mediocre man

801
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,531
and I--

802
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,532
Don't.

803
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,620
Don't ruin your life
for something trifle like love.

804
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,498
You're too good for that.

805
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,086
My sweet daughter.

806
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,673
You won't make me sad, will you?

807
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,761
Mom, you're so selfish.

808
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,025
Life

809
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,819
is a series of choices.

810
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,283
Producing a result
that matches your values.

811
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,370
People call it a good choice

812
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,372
or a correct answer.

813
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm 20.

814
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,837
I'm still confused about values of life.

815
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,135
If the coin comes up heads,

816
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,597
I'll become a person Mom wants.

817
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,434
If it comes up tails,

818
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,604
Mom will be crying.

819
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,963
Did the coin came up heads

820
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,423
or tails?

821
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,177
Flipping the coin,

822
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,013
which one did I wish for?

823
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,228
I decided to call it tails.

824
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:38,032
DANBAM

825
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,352
I realized something as soon as I saw him.

826
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,320
Did you go home well last night?

827
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,698
I didn't even need to hesitate.

828
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:21,868
Yes.

829
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,582
What brings you here?

830
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,727
I want to be with you.

831
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,815
What did you say?

832
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,818
Like Mom said,

833
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,612
I'm just too good.

834
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,908
Love and success.

835
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,619
I can achieve all those things.

836
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,998
I mean...

837
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,335
Feel sad just for a little while, Mom.

838
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:15,922
I want to

839
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,091
work here.

840
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:24,847
I will

841
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,517
help you achieve your dream, Boss.

842
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,231
He's not just a mediocre man.

843
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,275
I will turn him into someone amazing.

844
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,446
I will.

845
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:59,132
DANBAM

846
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,970
SPECIAL THANKS TO HONG SEOK-CHEON

847
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,082
What the hell are you talking about?

848
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,167
How dare you come here?

849
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,793
-Do you want to go clubbing?
-Club?

850
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,170
Let's go!

851
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,630
She's too good for him.

852
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,966
-What?
-Why?

853
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,134
Is that...

854
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,552
I'm like Zhuge Liang.

855
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,554
I'm Merlin and Rayleigh.

856
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,473
So it's all about taste.

857
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,016
Hyun-yi's not good at cooking.

858
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,309
You have to make a decision.

859
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,186
Hyun-yi is one of my people.
That's what matters.

860
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,979
No matter who it is,
I'll make my decision.

861
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,647
So this is Park Saeroyi's pub, right?

862
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,984
It is time for action, not words.

863
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,569
It's so annoying!

864
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,156
I'm not sorry for you at all.

865
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,867
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

866
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,828
You are always shining

867
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,872
too much.

868
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,754
