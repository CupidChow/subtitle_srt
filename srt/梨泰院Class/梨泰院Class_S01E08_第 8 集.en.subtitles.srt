ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,934
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,813
NEW BUILDING OWNER

4
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,861
Hello?

5
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,196
Hello.

6
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,075
I'm Park Saeroyi,
the owner of DanBam in Itaewon.

7
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,577
I heard you took over the building.

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,162
So I'm calling you to say hello.

9
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,205
Okay.

10
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,082
What a coincidence.

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,750
Pardon?

12
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,632
It's me.

13
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,634
Jang Dae-hee.

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,689
Is this

15
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,943
the beating you talked about?

16
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,823
Don't get the wrong idea.

17
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,449
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

18
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,578
I heard business in that spot
is doing well these days.

19
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,956
And the value of the building has gone up,

20
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,042
so I just thought
that it'd be a good investment.

21
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,132
Come to think of it, it's funny.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,094
What you did to take me down

23
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,514
ended up benefiting Jangga Co.

24
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,601
This beating is so vile.

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,982
Don't you have a favor to ask of me?

26
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,987
Come to Jangga Co. tomorrow.

27
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,080
Is it Jangga Co.?

28
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,918
EPISODE 8

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,753
Yes.

30
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,963
Jangga Pub?

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,215
They bought this building? Why?

32
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,842
I wonder too.

33
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,387
I'm so sick of them.

34
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,389
They just bought the building

35
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,641
just to get rid of someone
they don't like?

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,269
He is a man of huge caliber.

37
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,270
Don't you think so?

38
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,188
Yi-seo.

39
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,149
You see,

40
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,568
I don't even understand

41
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,570
how this shameless woman has the audacity

42
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,696
to come here for ice.

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,866
And I can't wrap my head around
why Geun-soo works here--

44
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,242
Enough!

45
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,252
Hey.

46
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,130
Another word and I won't let it go.

47
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,466
I'll go and bring her.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,763
Gosh.

49
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,140
This is so awkward.

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,227
That rude punk. She has such a bad temper.

51
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,312
I'll go get more ice.

52
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,106
It's okay.

53
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,361
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,743
You and the girl named Yi-seo.

55
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,871
I didn't know you were so emotional.

56
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,959
-What?
-Nothing.

57
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,462
You two seem very close.

58
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,300
And she has a point.

59
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,221
I can't borrow ice from you guys
because I feel bad.

60
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,037
Ask a part-timerÂ to do this.
Why carry it yourself?

61
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,750
-Give me that.
-Gosh, it's okay.

62
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,545
Ask me for favors anytime
when we're not at work.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,386
Any plans for the weekend?
I have tickets to a musical.

64
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,596
They're for VIP seats.

65
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,390
I have an extra ticket.
Do you want to come with me?

66
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,358
Do you like me?

67
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:00,985
What?

68
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes.

69
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,910
I don't like you.

70
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,206
Why not?

71
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,669
Because of that prick, Park Saeroyi?

72
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,924
Because of Mr. Park.

73
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:25,968
What?

74
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,429
The man you hit with your car

75
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,349
and killed.

76
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,063
He was like a father to me.

77
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,193
So please...

78
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,781
Stop hitting on me.

79
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,274
Sir, he's here.

80
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,082
We're meeting quite often.

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,834
I agree.

82
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:42,920
Let's hear it.

83
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,882
Are you here to argue with me?

84
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,679
So you'll run the business there?

85
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,681
You'd better sell it sooner than later.

86
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,558
To get the premium, that is.

87
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,518
Is that what this is about?

88
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,105
The premium...

89
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,860
It wouldn't be bad.

90
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,573
I know there's the Lease Protection Act,

91
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,619
but I can pretty much do anything I want
in this situation.

92
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,580
Who do you think will win
if we go to court?

93
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,625
And how will you run the pub
during the trials?

94
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,086
You knocked down a wall
and made structural change.

95
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,881
I could ask you
to restore the space as well.

96
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,800
But those petty details...

97
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,429
I don't care.

98
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,101
Then what do you want?

99
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,355
My son, Geun-soo.

100
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,483
Why are you letting him work there?

101
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,985
We were short-staffed.

102
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
Let him go.

103
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,948
That's up to him to decide.

104
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,741
Does having my son to work for you

105
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,661
help you boost your self-esteem?

106
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,875
Sir.

107
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,088
I suppose you use your employees
to boost your self-esteem.

108
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,467
He said you're a strong person.

109
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,515
Therefore, I plan to take this opportunity

110
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
to teach my son

111
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,521
what it really means to be strong.

112
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,028
You bought the building
to show off your power?

113
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,616
That's not all.

114
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,327
I know how persistent you can be.

115
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,039
Even after you get kicked out,
you'll open up a pub somewhere else.

116
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:42,957
Am I right?

117
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,879
Then I'll buy that building as well.

118
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,428
I'm going to buy every building
that you rent out.

119
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
Is that

120
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,896
your definition of power?

121
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,777
I can easily control and have influence
over all your achievements.

122
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,990
How isn't that power?

123
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,206
Seeing you today

124
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,293
reminds me when we first met.

125
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,588
You got expelled
because you were too stubborn

126
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,089
to get on your knees.

127
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,346
Haven't you had enough?

128
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,642
Park Saeroyi.

129
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,104
What would I get for ruining your life?

130
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,989
What do you want me to do?

131
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,327
You started off on the wrong foot,

132
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,412
so let's fix that first.

133
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,916
Get on your knees and apologize.

134
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,673
If I get on my knees, will you allow me

135
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,926
to continue my business?

136
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,302
Of course.

137
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,262
Haven't you learned?

138
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,141
You can't get what you want
by being emotional.

139
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,852
If you kneel and sincerely apologize,

140
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,106
I'll put the past behind us.

141
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,402
And I'll no longer try
to take anything from you.

142
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,783
Money.

143
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,744
You think money is what I want?

144
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,415
There's too much involved between us

145
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,583
to think of it so lightly.

146
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,715
What I want out of this fight isn't money.

147
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,091
Because

148
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,719
I am

149
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,096
your enemy.

150
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,313
The day I got expelled
for refusing to get on my knees,

151
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:17,570
my dad told me
that he's proud to have me as a son.

152
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,700
Getting expelled? Getting kicked out?

153
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,494
You took

154
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,331
absolutely nothing from me.

155
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,508
In my opinion, power comes from people.

156
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,220
Because their trust gives me strength.

157
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,892
So Geun-soo told you
that I'm a strong person?

158
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,061
I'm glad to hear that.

159
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,064
I'll become

160
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,026
even stronger.

161
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,407
If your business fails,

162
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,993
you'll lose your people.

163
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,746
They're the reason why I can continue
to run my business.

164
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,624
Is that so?

165
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,005
So you want to keep going?

166
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,717
Yes.

167
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,688
That was your last chance.

168
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,611
You'll regret this.

169
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,164
You want to stop
this ill-fated relationship?

170
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,210
There's one way to stop.
Do you want to know what it is?

171
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,509
Get punished
for all that you've done wrong

172
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,428
and get on your knees.

173
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,170
Saeroyi.

174
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,508
Right.

175
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,594
You work here during the day.

176
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,346
Yes. What about you?

177
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,015
What brings you here?

178
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,687
I met Chairman Jang.

179
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,524
We'll have to move out.

180
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,031
It's no big deal. Don't be so serious.

181
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,701
Are you okay?

182
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,124
I'm just upset that my plan

183
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,585
to make you quit
will take longer than expected.

184
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,547
You're such a fool.

185
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,843
Ms. Oh, the documents are ready.

186
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,553
It's time.

187
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,058
You should go. I'll see you at Itaewon.

188
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,186
Okay, I'll see you.

189
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,421
He bought the building?

190
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,299
I didn't know he would be so aggressive.

191
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,051
Exactly.

192
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,264
What's going to happen
now that he can't run the pub?

193
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,434
The best choice is to receive a premium
before the lease is over.

194
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,978
The Saeroyi I know

195
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,438
will quickly find another place.

196
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,484
How about asking him
to focus on my business instead?

197
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,404
A small business takes time to grow.

198
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,032
I was actually planning to talk to him
about that.

199
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,953
Is he doing okay?
He must be pretty discouraged right now.

200
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,914
He's fighting against Chairman Jang.

201
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,417
Deep down inside,
he's probably pretty upset.

202
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,043
But don't worry.

203
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,171
I've known him for ten years,

204
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,716
and during all the ups and downs,

205
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,844
I've never once seen him discouraged.

206
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,097
Yi-seo!

207
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,769
You stormed out yesterday,
but you came to work early.

208
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,689
I don't want to talk to anyone
from the Jang family.

209
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,232
So will you stop talking to me?

210
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,038
Then just tell me.

211
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,665
I know it's because of Saeroyi.

212
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,377
Tell me what my family did to him.

213
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,798
Okay, fine.

214
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,011
You didn't know anything,
so you probably felt at ease.

215
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
What?

216
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,227
Do you really want to know
what your family did

217
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,396
to our boss?

218
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,407
Hey, you're here.

219
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,702
Hey, you're our manager.

220
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,621
You can't just storm out like that.

221
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,206
Our boss was really worried.

222
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,042
What?

223
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,256
Why would you be worried?
I'm not a little kid.

224
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,303
I thought I'd be the first to come,
but you're all here already.

225
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,723
Hey, Geun-soo.

226
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,809
So what are you going to do?

227
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,817
Let's eat first.

228
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,451
What do you need?

229
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,748
I heard you decided to buy
the building where DanBam is at.

230
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,083
And?

231
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,837
May I ask you why?

232
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,588
Don't you know already?

233
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,718
I think I know
what you're going to say.

234
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,097
But I'm not in a very good mood.

235
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,558
So choose your words wisely.

236
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,063
It was very unlike you.

237
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,404
It was unlike me?

238
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,448
Yes.

239
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,870
This may sound out of line,

240
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,747
but I've known you for over ten years.

241
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,584
You've made choices that sometimes

242
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,919
went against the social custom.

243
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,920
I clearly told you

244
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,174
that I'm not in a good mood.

245
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,761
Are you telling me that I was wrong
to kick him out like that?

246
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,180
You?

247
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,434
But even if those choices were wrong,

248
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
all those choices were made

249
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,064
to benefit the company.

250
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,069
But the purchase of the building
seemed like an emotional decision.

251
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,654
-And that's not--
-Enough.

252
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,035
That's enough.

253
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:08,957
You may leave.

254
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,617
What I want out of this fight isn't money.

255
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,202
Because

256
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,829
I am

257
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,290
your enemy.

258
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,294
Do I really think

259
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,172
of that little kid

260
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,343
as my enemy?

261
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you know what he said to me?

262
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,687
"My life has just begun! And I'll do

263
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,148
everything I want to do."

264
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,943
That's what he said to me.

265
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,319
I'm so impressed.

266
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,030
Will you stop telling that story?
I've heard it enough.

267
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,240
Just have some jerky.

268
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,079
Why do you guys look so down?
Did you fight?

269
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,164
No.

270
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,959
It's no big deal.
Those two fight all the time.

271
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,502
Let's go for a second round.

272
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,461
Where should we go?

273
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,924
I'm not that interested,
but how about we go to a club?

274
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,929
A club? Sounds great. Let's go.

275
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,433
You must've had a lot of fun
the first time you went.

276
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,269
You think I had fun?
After I saw you that night...

277
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,186
What?

278
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,855
Let's just drop it.

279
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,358
What is it? Don't you want to go?

280
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,821
No, it's not that.
I was just wondering if it's fun there.

281
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,114
I've never been.

282
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,282
Yes, it's fun.

283
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,533
Okay.

284
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,705
-There we go.
-What are you doing?

285
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,081
Just watch.

286
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,589
Get up. Let me teach you
how to have fun at a club.

287
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,673
-Here?
-Yes.

288
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,302
First, you need to smile.

289
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,137
-Smile?
-Yes, smile.

290
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,559
Okay, that's good.
The next step is to show your presence.

291
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,105
-Okay.
-Step three is to get close.

292
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,399
-Sit back down.
-Sorry.

293
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,794
When you go clubbing in Korea,

294
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,464
it's best not to hit on too many women.

295
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,758
Then what should I do?

296
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,260
Your first choice is very important, okay?

297
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,847
"He's hitting on me
after getting rejected by her?"

298
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,642
You don't want a woman to think that way.

299
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,895
What's going on? Tell me.

300
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,899
-It's nothing.
-You're so petty.

301
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,568
Are you still upset
because of what Yi-seo said?

302
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,284
You guys can go first.
I want to have a word with Geun-soo.

303
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,036
Okay, we'll see you there.

304
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,288
-Okay.
-Let's go.

305
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,589
Let's go.

306
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,473
What's wrong?

307
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,268
Is it because of Yi-seo?

308
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,438
I heard everything.

309
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,355
Heard what?

310
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,567
I heard

311
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,279
what my family did to you.

312
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,201
Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,664
Because it's between me

314
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,959
and your brother and father.

315
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,795
It has nothing to do with you.

316
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,426
I knew

317
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,971
you would think like that.

318
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,976
Because that's your principle.

319
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,523
Why did you offer to work

320
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,734
at DanBam?

321
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,696
I told you.

322
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,574
I wanted to make money.

323
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,827
To be honest,

324
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,413
it looked like

325
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,208
you needed

326
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,670
someone to lean on.

327
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,260
This might sound out of line.

328
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,223
And it might sound funny.

329
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,143
But I thought DanBam
and I might be able

330
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,607
to give you something to lean on.

331
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,236
Thank you.

332
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,906
-But I don't need you to pity--
-I'm not pitying you.

333
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,574
You just reminded me of

334
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,329
myself.

335
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,461
I wanted to get along with you well.

336
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,090
But I didn't think of how you'd feel

337
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,094
after you found out everything.

338
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,055
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,224
No.

340
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,936
No, you don't need to do that.

341
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,313
You don't need

342
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,024
to apologize.

343
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,362
Geun-soo.

344
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,536
I'm really sorry
for what my family has done

345
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,291
to you.

346
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,219
They will

347
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,348
get punished no matter what.

348
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,719
-What do you think? Isn't it great?
-It looks so fun.

349
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,888
-Have you been to a club in Korea?
-I haven't.

350
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,389
You're pretty new yourself.

351
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,183
I'm a professional clubber.

352
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,105
Here.

353
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,777
Oh, my ID. Just a second.

354
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,278
You don't need to show me.

355
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,698
Look at yourself.
You're obviously old enough.

356
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,116
Okay.

357
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,622
What?

358
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,248
I'm--

359
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,000
Why are you asking him that?

360
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,544
People from Africa
and the Middle East can't enter.

361
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,297
Come on. This is Itaewon.
Don't be like that.

362
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,091
You're embarrassing us.

363
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,051
I'm just following the rules.

364
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,345
Where are you from?

365
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,139
I'm Korean.

366
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,476
Show me your passport.

367
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,438
But I'm Korean.

368
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,816
My dad is Korean.

369
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,402
Hey, we have a bugger.
Send someone to the entrance.

370
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:20,865
Why would you call him that
when he's right there?

371
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,575
Hey, don't explode.

372
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,788
Just leave while I'm being nice.

373
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,834
-And what if I refuse?
-Forget it.

374
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,378
They don't accept Africans.
Let's go somewhere else.

375
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,881
But I told you that my dad is Korean.

376
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,008
Let's go already.

377
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,512
I'm also Korean, okay?

378
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,848
How are you Korean?

379
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,516
-You have dark skin.
-Hey.

380
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:48,935
You...

381
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,981
You're so mean!

382
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,649
-Toni!
-Hey!

383
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,693
Toni, where are you going?

384
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:57,986
Toni!

385
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,447
My gosh.

386
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,286
-What's with him?
-They wouldn't let him in.

387
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,121
What? Why?

388
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,956
They don't accept Africans.

389
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,251
That's up to the owner.

390
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,503
He kept saying he's Korean.

391
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,297
He got upset for not taking his side.

392
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,758
Hey, will you stop being so mean?

393
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,970
You've been getting on my nerves
since yesterday.

394
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:24,888
What?

395
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,557
He's obviously not Korean.

396
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,350
Yi-seo, that's enough.

397
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,186
Boss, you should stop too.

398
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,694
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

399
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,862
DANBAM PUB

400
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,197
YOU'RE SO PRETTY

401
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,744
DON'T GET HURT,
AND LET'S MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

402
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,882
What am I going to do?

403
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,496
YOU RACIST

404
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,498
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY

405
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,166
YOU HUMILIATE KOREA

406
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,043
EAT SHIT

407
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,923
What the...

408
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,470
-What's on your jacket?
-What?

409
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,308
It's nothing.

410
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,521
What's your plan for the pub?

411
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,356
We'll move out.

412
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,993
What's this?

413
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,078
A decent firm to invest in to make money.

414
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,541
I don't have money to invest.

415
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,756
Why don't you shut down the pub?

416
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,468
It doesn't earn much money
compared to the investment.

417
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,469
And it's too risky.

418
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,180
And it'll be riskier
if Jangga Co. gets in the way.

419
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,599
This is an important period.

420
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,101
You should solely be focused
on supporting Ms. Kang.

421
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,520
But you need to move
and get ready to reopen.

422
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,188
It'll be too inefficient.

423
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:42,859
No.

424
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,488
If you invest your premium, you'll make--

425
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,406
I won't do it.

426
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,286
What about Chairman Jang?

427
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,122
He said he'll buy every building
that you rent out.

428
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,498
You need to be realistic.

429
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,168
If he keeps targeting you,
your pub will never succeed.

430
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,173
There's one way.

431
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,592
What's that?

432
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,730
I'm going to call Ms. Kang
and ask her to meet today.

433
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,277
No way.

434
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,032
I'm sorry.

435
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,846
DANBAM

436
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,324
You're here early.
You work too hard these days.

437
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,242
Hey, you guys.

438
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,174
Yi-seo.

439
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,301
What?

440
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,220
Can we talk?

441
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,764
DANBAM

442
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,476
What is it?

443
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,900
It's better to stay here

444
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,320
than to move to a new spot, right?

445
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,073
Why do you ask the obvious?

446
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,076
I plan

447
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,329
to quit working at Danbam.

448
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,963
That's what you wanted to say?

449
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,508
In return for going back home,

450
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,510
I'm going to ask my dad

451
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,513
to leave Saeroyi alone.

452
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,976
That would be

453
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,937
the best choice, right?

454
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,787
Will you please do that?

455
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,376
I'd be really grateful.

456
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,259
My gosh.

457
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:01,766
You really are mean.

458
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,695
After you dance with her a bit more

459
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,032
and give her a few compliments...

460
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,285
Aren't you thirsty?

461
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,705
I have a table over there.
Do you want to drink with me?

462
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,375
That's all you need to say to her.

463
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,129
Then the night will be yours.

464
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,714
-Gosh, that's nuts.
-I'm so excited.

465
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,632
What?

466
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,357
-Hello?
-Aren't you cold?

467
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,359
You look so emotional.

468
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,541
I wanted to talk to you.

469
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:09,876
About what?

470
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,754
Chairman Jang bought the building
that I rented out.

471
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,800
Ho-jin already told me.
Do you need to borrow money?

472
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,177
No.

473
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,641
I'd like to withdraw one billion won
of my stocks in Jangga Co.

474
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,229
Then you won't have any influence
in the company.

475
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,732
I'm sorry.

476
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,156
This is different
from what Ho-jin had planned.

477
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,576
I thought you'd drop the pub
and focus on me.

478
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,582
It's not even a franchise
or a famous brand.

479
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,628
Do you really need
to risk everything on that small pub?

480
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,547
It's precious to me.

481
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:01,010
Yes, but Chairman Jang easily took
that precious pub away from you.

482
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,094
The pub...

483
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,140
it's all about the people.

484
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,619
So Toni didn't show up.

485
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,663
He's not answering my calls.

486
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,916
Hey.

487
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,962
Why don't you apologize to Toni?

488
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:36,921
Why would I?

489
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,589
I knew you'd be like this.

490
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,345
Soo-ah, why are you carrying the beer?
Let me take them for you.

491
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,602
I made myself clear
that I hate you the other day.

492
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,396
But you keep showing up.

493
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,522
Where's Saeroyi?

494
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,274
You're here.

495
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,068
Hey, Soo-ah. You come here quite often
these days.

496
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,530
I came to return the beer I borrowed.
Do you not want me here as well?

497
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,243
What? No one's here.

498
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,745
We had some customers earlier.
They just left.

499
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,663
I see.

500
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,458
-Boss.
-Yes?

501
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,836
Geun-soo has something to say.

502
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,974
DANBAM

503
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,354
What is it?

504
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,651
Well...

505
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,034
I want to quit.

506
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,953
Why are you being like this?

507
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,756
What's the reason?

508
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,050
Nothing.

509
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,470
I think it'd be better this way.

510
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,641
If the reason you're quitting
has something to do

511
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,770
with your father or brother,

512
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,148
can't you just stay?

513
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,151
I like you.
You're like my younger brother.

514
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,244
Geun-soo says he will talk to his dad

515
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,288
on condition that he quits his job here.

516
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,834
He'll talk to his dad?
What does that mean?

517
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,545
So we can keep our business running here.

518
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,839
Even if we get the premium
and find a new place,

519
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,717
we'll have to pay brokerage
and interior design fees.

520
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,636
It costs hundreds of millions of won.

521
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,430
The best option is to stay here.

522
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,266
And we can do that with Geun-soo gone.

523
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,693
What do you think?

524
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,154
Of course I agree with it.

525
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,116
Geun-soo must've felt
uncomfortable working here.

526
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,493
You should understand how Geun-soo--

527
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,581
JO YI-SEO

528
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,641
What are you doing?

529
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,768
You don't deserve

530
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,896
to be the manager here.

531
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,818
But...

532
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,571
-Saeroyi, wait.
-This is our business.

533
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:52,992
Sympathy.

534
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
It's sympathy again.

535
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,830
It's...

536
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,501
It's just sympathy.
How long will you let it get in your way?

537
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,379
You're always at the mercy of everyone.

538
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,965
Franchise? Leadership
in the foodservice industry?

539
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,592
How will you make it happen?

540
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,969
Forget about Jangga Co.

541
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,764
If you run your business like this,
you're no match for Jangga Co.

542
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,558
So you don't want to lose anyone.

543
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,852
Because DanBam is like a family.

544
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,439
Will you please wake up to the reality?

545
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,860
If you just fire a part-timer,
it'll all be over.

546
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,281
How much money do you want to lose
before you pull yourself together?

547
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,588
Business is all about profit--

548
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,797
For me...

549
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,473
If that's what it is all about,
I won't do it.

550
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,266
Boss, please...

551
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,769
If I were to become like him,
I wouldn't have started.

552
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,604
And look at where we are now.

553
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,940
We're about to get kicked out.

554
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,151
I just

555
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,447
don't want you to suffer a loss.

556
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,454
So what if we get kicked out
and it costs hundreds of millions of won?

557
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,414
Jangga Co. is my enemy.

558
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,959
It's only natural
that my enemy attacks me.

559
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,336
It was bound to happen anyway.
No big deal.

560
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,963
What makes me upset now

561
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,716
is you whom I thought was on my side.

562
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,179
I just said that for your sake.

563
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,473
-I was concerned about--
-Why?

564
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,601
Why do you have to fire

565
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,480
someone I care about for my sake?

566
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,834
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,838
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

568
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,842
I should go get some fresh air.

569
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,847
I get what you are saying.

570
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,308
But I'm the manager here.

571
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,893
No matter how idealistic you're being,

572
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,104
we will eventually get kicked out of here.

573
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,941
And we can't be sure
the same thing won't happen again.

574
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,489
I bet my life on you.

575
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,034
You have to take responsibility.

576
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,995
I need a realistic alternative.

577
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,376
You're an idealist.

578
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,170
That old man

579
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,131
keeps his words no matter what.

580
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,509
Even if you move to another place
with your precious employees,

581
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,428
the same thing will happen again someday

582
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,347
unless you have a realistic alternative.

583
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,557
That's the reason
I'm retrieving the investment.

584
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,812
To protect my people.

585
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,066
I won't be swayed
by Chairman Jang anymore.

586
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,823
You have no alternative.

587
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,620
I'll buy a building.

588
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,838
What are you talking about?

589
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,008
The realistic alternative.

590
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,646
It's a lie.

591
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,856
You know him.

592
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,360
Saeroyi never lies.

593
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,411
Can I talk to you for a moment?

594
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,808
JO YI-SEO

595
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,859
What do you want?

596
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,863
I want to give you some help.

597
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,449
Did you not hear what he said earlier?

598
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,118
This is our business. Stay out of it.

599
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,203
No.

600
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,873
I mean about Saeroyi.

601
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,588
You work at DanBam
because you like him, right?

602
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,173
So?

603
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,636
If Saeroyi was a sly guy
who pursues practical interest,

604
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,221
would you have liked him?

605
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,725
What's your point?

606
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,314
You know about Saeroyi's past.

607
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,944
It counts only when he proves himself
in the opposite way

608
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,155
of what Chairman Jang has done.

609
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,867
And as you know,

610
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,287
it's a very hard thing to do.

611
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,873
For him

612
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,085
and for those who watch him do so.

613
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,007
But Saeroyi won't change.

614
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,217
I mean,

615
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,885
no one can change him.

616
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,430
He's very strong.

617
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,602
If you really want to be on his side,

618
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,021
don't try to change him.

619
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,732
You should be ready to walk with him.

620
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,276
You should understand him.

621
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,990
So I guess you understand him very well.

622
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,243
Not really.

623
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,913
That's why I'm not on his side.

624
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,176
I should get going.

625
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,972
Why are you telling me all that?

626
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,184
Well...

627
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,727
I don't know.

628
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,607
I didn't feel like working.

629
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,653
Did you give up on him then?

630
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:46,905
No.

631
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,992
Because I'm confident.

632
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,493
I told you.

633
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,413
Saeroyi likes me.

634
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,792
You know what?

635
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,254
I really hate you.

636
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,089
Well...

637
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,757
I know that too.

638
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,679
Keep your chin up, Cutie.

639
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,154
If Saeroyi was a sly guy
who pursues practical interest,

640
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,780
would you have liked him?

641
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,574
Just this once?

642
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,578
Just this once? Once and for all?
But there will be another time.

643
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,498
It will make things easy this once.

644
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,042
But you know what?

645
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,336
That one time

646
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,213
can change your whole life.

647
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,092
Thank you for everything until now.

648
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,344
It's twice your pay.

649
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,639
If you like working here,

650
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,224
I want you to work twice as hard.

651
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,852
Can you do that?

652
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,361
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

653
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,655
YOU RACIST
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY

654
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,658
Can't you do it right?

655
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,869
He's really strange.

656
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,666
It's strange,

657
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,419
but I like him.

658
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:53,991
Jang Geun-soo.

659
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,868
Oh... Yi-seo.

660
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:05,961
I'm sorry.

661
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,258
You must be mad at me.

662
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,096
What can I do to make it up to you?

663
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,978
I'm not mad.

664
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,070
Yes, you are.
You have every reason to be mad.

665
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,822
I was heartless.

666
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,741
We've been friends for quite long.

667
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,576
You were always heartless.

668
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,954
You are also inconsiderate

669
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,789
and selfish.

670
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,961
I guess you were really hurt.

671
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,302
But I like you

672
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,348
the way you are.

673
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,567
I was being ambiguous before.

674
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,071
I think I should make myself clear.

675
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,075
I love our Boss like crazy.

676
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,038
I'm trying to be nice to you
when you're just a headache

677
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,374
because I want to stay by his side.

678
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,253
So

679
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,298
don't stand in my way.

680
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:35,842
I should go.

681
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:57,989
YONGSAN-GU OFFICE

682
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,324
I'm telling you.

683
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,284
How many times must I say it?

684
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,204
I can't retrieve personal information
without his consent.

685
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,790
He's not a stranger. He's my dad.

686
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,333
Take a look at this.

687
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,879
You can't prove paternity
only with a picture.

688
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,757
You should bring
the family relation certificate.

689
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,175
Then I'll look into it.

690
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,934
I went to a club in Itaewon
with my coworkers last night,

691
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,477
but we were denied admission

692
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,521
just because one of our employees,

693
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,648
Toni was from Africa.

694
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,441
I can't believe there's still racism.

695
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,694
-My gosh.
-Itaewon is an international town.

696
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,864
I resent all those racists.

697
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,117
This is embarrassing.
It's a disgrace to our country.

698
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,245
-I can't believe it still happens.
-It's just skin color.

699
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:46,955
You're here.

700
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,832
Hey.

701
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,043
Hey, did you do this?

702
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,003
Do what?

703
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,547
Well...

704
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,549
I did.

705
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,972
You said messing with your people

706
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,683
is just like messing with you.

707
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,893
So I made up my mind.

708
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,270
I will just kill those

709
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:11,980
who mess with you.

710
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,815
Hey, Yi-seo.

711
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,233
You sound so cool.

712
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,572
Where's Toni? Is he here yet?

713
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,408
Will you try calling him?

714
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,497
What? Hey.

715
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,542
-Well...
-Toni.

716
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,967
I WENT TO A CLUB IN ITAEWON

717
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,846
I'm Korean.

718
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,141
You know what?

719
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,560
You don't look Korean.

720
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,062
How could you be Korean?

721
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,647
She was doing so well.

722
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,108
My dad is Korean.

723
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,612
My dad came to Korea to meet my grandma.

724
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,697
And I came to Korea to find my dad.

725
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,033
Once I find him,

726
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,160
I can acquire Korean nationality.

727
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,667
I'm Korean.

728
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,545
But the fact is that you didn't
acquire Korean nationality yet.

729
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,215
It means you're not Korean.

730
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:23,927
Yi-seo.

731
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,886
I'll

732
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,306
help you find your dad.

733
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,894
Yi-seo.

734
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,563
I'll do anything to help you.

735
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,236
I'm sorry

736
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,239
that I didn't take your side.

737
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,917
I have a stomachache.
I need to go to the restroom.

738
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,629
Gosh.

739
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,341
It feels so warm.

740
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,803
Spray painting was so childish.

741
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,306
You should use your brains.

742
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,107
Gosh.

743
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,150
Wait.

744
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,654
Give me back my name tag.

745
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,706
This?

746
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,213
Put it on me.

747
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,445
It's really hard
to deal with people like you.

748
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,615
But I'll try to understand.

749
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,037
Thank you.

750
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,503
Yi-seo, you're all grown up.

751
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,140
This is the last one
about Jiin Department Store.

752
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,141
Okay.

753
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,685
And

754
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,106
a new tenant has moved
into the building where DanBam was.

755
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,111
He had no choice but to move out.

756
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,405
We have to nip it in the bud.

757
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,825
You should buy the building again.

758
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,369
Do you know where he moved to?

759
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,037
Well...

760
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,874
He bought a building
at Gyeongridan-gil Road.

761
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:09,968
What?

762
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:20,270
DANBAM

763
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,026
Please take a look.

764
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:28,987
Here?

765
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,158
-A little more to the left.
-Here?.

766
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,951
-I think it's good.
-Left?

767
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,290
All right.

768
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,377
Cool. You're a man of your word.

769
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,464
-We still have a long way to go.
-She's right.

770
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,716
Hello. We opened a new pub here.

771
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,761
Did you move in here?

772
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,014
Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.

773
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,599
Why did you buy this building?

774
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,809
You are no good judge of buildings.

775
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,060
Why?

776
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,105
All the businesses here
have gone bust every year.

777
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,024
My gosh.

778
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,986
Call me if you need anything.

779
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,779
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, dear.

780
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,827
DAILY INSTALLMENT LOAN

781
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,998
-What did she say?
-All the businesses here have failed.

782
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,049
The pub is all about the people.

783
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,592
People.

784
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,845
I told you. Business is all about people.

785
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,016
It's not like we're a charity.
This is business.

786
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,768
We need to make a profit.

787
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,353
We should see it at large.

788
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,939
Who would trust a company
that's inconsistent?

789
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,317
It's all over once we lose
the confidence of people.

790
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,823
Like father, like son.

791
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,794
He retrieved the investment

792
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,755
and bought a building?

793
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,184
I was going to visit you to apologize.

794
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,103
I'm surprised you came all the way here.

795
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,271
Apologize?

796
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,023
About the investment I retrieved.

797
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,693
I caused trouble to your schedule.

798
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,903
I told you before.

799
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,738
One percent. Two billion won.

800
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,532
They are just numbers.

801
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,745
The mission I gave you was
to make Chairman Jang go to your pub.

802
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,788
It wasn't the money.

803
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,752
Do you still want me on your side?

804
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:51,963
Of course.

805
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,259
Chairman Jang and Jang Geun-won.

806
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,596
Your goal is to get back at them, right?

807
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,392
We should have the same goal
to plan something together.

808
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,770
Are you sure revenge is all you want?

809
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:09,731
What I want...

810
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,861
after revenge.

811
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,574
What I want

812
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,618
is freedom.

813
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:23,911
Freedom?

814
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:30,501
I want my words and actions to have power

815
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,921
so no one can mess with me and my people.

816
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:39,636
I don't want to be swayed
by anyone or any injustice.

817
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,890
I want to live a life

818
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,684
where I make my own decisions

819
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,563
and I don't have to pay for my principles.

820
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,483
Gosh.

821
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,237
It's just an ambiguous wordplay
of an idealist.

822
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,160
I like it though.

823
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,582
This freedom you talk of...

824
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,628
Let's enjoy it together.

825
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,174
Okay.

826
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:43,116
The power and people he talked about...

827
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,078
You took

828
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,832
absolutely nothing from me.

829
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,378
I couldn't take anything from him?

830
01:01:58,965 --> 01:01:59,799
What?

831
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,303
As I grow older,

832
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,515
I'm becoming pettier.

833
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,062
A building owner?

834
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,191
In the end, you keep moving forward.

835
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,777
I'm not even surprised.

836
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,531
We should wait and see.

837
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,284
Businesses at that spot
have failed every year.

838
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,911
You don't seem worried though.

839
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:31,706
Well...

840
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,917
Because I have my people.

841
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,211
I trust them and keep going.

842
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,428
I'm jealous.

843
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,222
What?

844
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:50,892
Jealous of what?

845
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,188
You seem to care about them a lot.

846
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:01,068
-That's because--
-You really need her, right?

847
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,408
I mean, Yi-seo.

848
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,245
On your way

849
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:14,123
to make me unemployed.

850
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,126
You need her, right?

851
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,224
Chairman Jang,
the guest you're expecting is here.

852
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,809
Okay. Let her in.

853
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,603
Are you expecting someone?

854
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,624
It hasn't been long since she joined,

855
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,752
but I can't imagineÂ DanBam

856
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,089
without Yi-seo.

857
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,824
DANBAM
