PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,109
A SWEET NIGHT

4
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,826
So your goal is my doom.

5
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,455
It's funny I'm feeling this way

6
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,166
at my age.

7
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,171
Hello. Welcome to DanBam.

8
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,357
I wanted to see you.

9
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,153
I really wanted to meet you too.

10
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,164
BOSS PARK SAEROYI

11
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,625
Yes.

12
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,460
EPISODE 7

13
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,088
-What would you like to order?
-What would you recommend?

14
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,506
The squid is good,

15
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,008
so you should try
our mussel soup with squid.

16
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,677
-I see. We'll get this and...
-Okay.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,846
Is there anything else you need?

18
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,681
A glass of iced water for me, please.

19
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,267
Sure. Your food will be out shortly.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,268
-Okay.
-Thank you.

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,857
Are you ready to order, Mr. Chairman?

22
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
Do you know who I am?

23
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,820
Everyone in the restaurant industry knows
who you are.

24
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,576
I'd like a stew and a stir-fried dish.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,328
Pick what you think is the best.

26
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,747
And a bottle of soju as well.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,292
One stew, one stir-fried dish,
and a bottle of soju.

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,835
Right away, sir.

29
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,597
What did he order?

30
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,640
A stew and a stir-fried dish.

31
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,559
He told me to pick the best one.

32
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,940
A stew and a stir-fried dish?

33
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
He's your dad. Do you know what he likes?

34
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,863
He tends to like salty, spicy foods.

35
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,867
Let's do stir-fried pork with bean sprouts
and soft tofu stew.

36
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,535
Yes, those are the best ones.

37
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,329
I'll ask for extra seasoning.

38
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,246
No, don't.

39
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,750
Listen, guys.

40
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,341
I don't want him to catch any flaws today.

41
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,468
So

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,514
just do what you normally do.

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,225
-Okay.
-Okay.

44
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,815
Excuse me.

45
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,778
Have you lost your mind?

46
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,947
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,031
I'm working.

48
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,784
Exactly. Why the hell are you--

49
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,785
Enough.

50
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,705
You don't belong here.

51
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,878
Where do I belong?

52
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,551
Is Jangga Co.

53
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,346
where I belong?

54
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,436
I'm here to eat.

55
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,814
We'll talk another time.

56
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,363
Enjoy your food.

57
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,368
JANG GEUN-SOO

58
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,834
Boss.

59
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,211
-Yes?
-The stove.

60
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,387
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

61
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,688
Enjoy.

62
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,398
Hey.

63
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,736
I noticed you bought our stock.

64
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,946
What?

65
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,159
It's a blue-chip stock.

66
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,953
-I thought it'd be a good investment.
-No.

67
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,997
I'm talking about

68
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,292
when our stock price plummeted
eight years ago.

69
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,466
You invested over 100 million won.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,970
It was probably money
from Mr. Park's insurance. You invested...

71
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,640
all of that money in Jangga Co.,
which was collapsing?

72
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,267
Why?

73
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,813
Because I believed in it.

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,444
You believed in it?

75
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,114
The brand image might have been tarnished,

76
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,991
but its core values...

77
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,619
Its brand essence didn't change.

78
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,916
I thought it'd be
a good long-term investment.

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,962
So it was just for the profits?

80
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,714
What else would it be for?

81
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,764
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

82
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,976
What's the investment of this morning
supposed to mean?

83
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,854
This morning?

84
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,399
You invested about 600 million won.

85
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,276
What? 600 million?

86
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,490
You invested that much?

87
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,995
What's your motive?

88
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,293
I guess

89
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,714
you're bothered about me.

90
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,138
I did it for the same reason.

91
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,103
You're not a good liar.

92
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,876
Here you go, sir.

93
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,879
To be honest, I had high expectations.

94
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,050
I'm saying this
because I've now tasted your food.

95
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,220
No matter what you're thinking,
you can't beat Jangga Co.

96
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,556
Just be grateful

97
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,893
that I don't consider you as my enemy.

98
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm saying this because of Mr. Park.

99
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,830
Give up and take it easy.

100
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,962
Let's go.

101
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,921
Okay, Dad.

102
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,885
"Give up and take it easy"?

103
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,308
I can't, sir.

104
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,730
Being stubborn

105
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,607
and foolish

106
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,235
and my life itself...

107
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,712
Since youâ€™ve noticed it,
let me tell you again

108
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,176
It may be a slow process,
but I am doing things step by step.

109
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
And you are my end goal.

110
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,476
Are you out of your mind? Know your place.

111
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,728
You!

112
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,405
Keep your mouth shut.

113
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,335
Because of my father?

114
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,296
Don't kid yourself.

115
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,966
The only thing you can do
for my late father

116
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,637
is getting on your knees
and paying for what you did.

117
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,931
And I'll make that happen.

118
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,241
A stubborn fool is now even bluffing.
What a joke.

119
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,703
You deserve a beating.

120
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm not just bluffing.

121
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,084
Do you know this?

122
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,628
Tigers don't growl or roar.

123
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,546
They just chew you to pieces.

124
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,761
I'll soon teach you what that means.

125
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,519
Goodbye!

126
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,438
Thank you for visiting DanBam!

127
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,014
DANBAM

128
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,350
DANBAM

129
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,606
You're actually looking that up?

130
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,235
Tigers do roar, of course.

131
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,278
I know.

132
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,655
They roar so loudly.

133
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,784
He's obviously never seen a tiger
in his life. That old man bullshitted me.

134
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,245
He was implying
that he will trample all over you.

135
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,915
-I won't be fazed by it.
-You should've kept your cool.

136
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,126
You're no match for him, after all.

137
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,961
That's not how you start a fight.

138
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,506
He'll think I'm a kid
who can't even control his anger.

139
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,551
I want him to think that.

140
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,680
-What?
-He'll try to walk all over me,

141
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,349
but that was bound to happen.

142
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,811
Thinking I'm just a clueless kid,
he won't go all out.

143
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,191
What are you talking about?

144
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,402
Chairman Jang came by. Can we meet now?

145
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,865
A fight is all about the first punch.

146
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,117
And you throw the first punch

147
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,246
behind the back.

148
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,464
Sure.

149
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,397
I'm here to see one of the inmates.

150
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,317
Here's a visiting application.

151
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,778
Fill it out and wait a few minutes.

152
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,950
NAME OF INMATE YOU WISH TO VISIT:
PARK SAEROYI

153
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,038
RELATIONSHIP

154
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,292
Inmate 2127. You have a visitor.

155
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,756
Hey.

156
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,474
What brings you here?

157
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,434
I'm curious about something.

158
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,688
Curious? About what?

159
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,358
Why did you

160
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,652
hit Jang Geun-won that day?

161
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,154
I just couldn't stand him.

162
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,659
-You don't need to thank me--
-I don't need to thank you?

163
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,412
Don't be delusional.
You were just being nosy.

164
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,497
That's not how you fight.

165
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,834
I was fighting against him in my own way,
by holding out.

166
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,379
And you ended up behind bars
because you couldn't control your temper.

167
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
Why are you all prickly?

168
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,146
Well, you are right.

169
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,565
But don't be such a know-it-all.

170
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,277
Sometimes you're faced
with things that you just can't tolerate.

171
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,616
You should leave if you're finished.

172
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,826
What will you do now?

173
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,329
Any plans after getting out?

174
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:14,955
Well,

175
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,999
I don't want to tell you.

176
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,126
I find you obnoxious.

177
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,428
I got into Business Management
at Hanguk University.

178
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,848
I achieved it
by going through hell for three years.

179
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,767
I see.

180
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,228
It'll be good
if you can forget everything.

181
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,397
That's great.

182
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,567
Can you?

183
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,489
Can you put everything behind and move on?

184
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,079
It's just something
those who have never been bullied say.

185
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,332
Don't you know that I hate plain milk?

186
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,875
Tell me.

187
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,044
Look at me.

188
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,756
Still, Jang Geun-won shows up
in my dreams and wakes me up at night.

189
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,593
I've gone up to the roof countless times
in the middle of the night, to die.

190
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,597
I don't know how to comfort--

191
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,474
Three years is a long time.

192
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,102
What got me through that hell...

193
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,942
was my goal to get my revenge.

194
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,411
I want to be an asset manager.

195
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,956
It's like a fund manager.

196
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,334
First off,

197
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,628
I admit that I'm a little twisted.

198
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,339
That's why I lied earlier.

199
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,550
To be honest,

200
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,302
I wanted to thank you.

201
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,264
For helping me.

202
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,937
I plan to open a pub

203
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,689
when I get out.

204
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,401
I want to succeed in the food industry

205
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,279
and take Jangga Co. down.

206
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,785
That's my goal.

207
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,124
It won't be easy.

208
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,002
-I never thought it'd be--
-It'll be hard.

209
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,969
Unless you work with a fund manager
who knows what he's doing.

210
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,941
What's your name?

211
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,821
Lee Ho-jin.

212
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,076
I'm Park Saeroyi.

213
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,244
Ho-jin.

214
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,749
Do you want to be my ally?

215
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,093
That's why I came to see you.

216
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,772
RELATIONSHIP: FRIEND

217
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,657
1.9 billion won in Jangga Co.

218
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,243
It was a bit of an impulsive move.

219
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,831
If we waited about a year,
it would've gone up 500 million more.

220
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,833
Why didn't you stop me?

221
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,293
What about you?

222
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,379
I was still in school seven years ago.

223
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,464
Why did you trust me with it?

224
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,927
Why ask now? You did a good job
of growing my money.

225
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,764
But that money was
from your dad's life insurance.

226
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
I know nothing about stocks.

227
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,352
That's why a professional fund--

228
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,272
I know nothing about stocks,
but I know you.

229
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,526
You said those three years were like hell.

230
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,572
You endured and held out
throughout that grueling fight

231
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,949
and got into the best university.

232
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,618
You're stubborn and tenacious.

233
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,420
You say that and make me do
all sorts of shit.

234
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:33,922
What?

235
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,799
Kang Min-jung.

236
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,844
Thinking about that time
still makes me shudder.

237
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,560
The last time I saw you was
at Mr. Park's funeral.

238
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,521
I should be happy to see you,

239
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,690
but I'm quite upset.

240
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,695
Did you order Ho-jin
to deliberately approach me?

241
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,240
I apologize if it upset you.

242
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,036
I heard about
what the chairman did to you.

243
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,331
You see, I was fond of Mr. Park,
and I admired him.

244
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,752
But unfortunately, I'm not motivated
by things like sympathy and compassion.

245
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,298
I heard Ho-jin has helped you

246
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,842
double your money.

247
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,636
So?

248
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,889
And I heard you want Jangga Co. to do well
more than anybody else.

249
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,265
And?

250
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,519
I'd like to support you.

251
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,107
How?

252
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:40,155
If a shareholders' meeting were to be held
sometime in the future, that is.

253
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,830
You must've gauged the scope
of Ho-jin's abilities by now.

254
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,333
Yes, he's very capable.

255
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,376
But what about you?

256
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,587
You worked hard for seven years
and opened a pub, I heard.

257
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,672
It's impressive.

258
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,049
Mr. Park would be so proud of you.

259
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,051
But you see,

260
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,886
this is a whole different ball game.

261
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,140
Even if you sell your precious business
that's worth a few hundred million won,

262
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,227
you can only buy under one percent share.
Do you realize that?

263
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,775
There's nothing you can do to support me.

264
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,364
What if I come to own
one percent share of Jangga Co.?

265
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,493
One percent?

266
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,955
The total value of its shares
exceeds 200 billion won.

267
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,416
One percent of that is two billion won.

268
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,711
Kiddie, you'll never get to touch
that kind of money.

269
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,422
And truthfully,
even that won't really be a big help.

270
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,050
But it'll be a great way to test me.

271
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,804
If I pull it off, you'll know that
you shouldn't underestimate me.

272
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,933
And even if it's not a big help,
it'll still be helpful for you.

273
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,812
And,

274
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,772
I'd like you to know

275
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,359
that I don't have to have you
join hands with me.

276
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,945
Saeroyi.

277
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,082
You're talking as if you already have
what you haven't even acquired.

278
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,626
That's how I've lived so far.

279
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,255
What do you want from me?

280
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,093
You're the second-biggest shareholder,
following the chairman.

281
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,553
So what?

282
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,722
You've known Geun-won for many years.

283
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,224
Can he really lead Jangga Co.?

284
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,313
Jangga Co. led by Jang Geun-won.

285
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,857
Will it succeed and thrive?

286
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,275
What are you trying to say?

287
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,360
Jangga Co.

288
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,695
should be led by you.

289
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,409
When the dismissal of Chairman Jang
is brought up,

290
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,412
I will be by your side.

291
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,146
You said the chairman is your enemy.

292
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,148
Yes.

293
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,067
Revenge...

294
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,528
What do you think he thinks of you?

295
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,280
You're like a fruit fly to him.

296
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,286
I mean, look at you bluffing
just because you now own a small pub.

297
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,916
Your brazen bluff won't get me excited

298
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,168
because I like peace.

299
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,141
I suppose I'm talking
to the wrong person, then.

300
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,480
Sorry to bother you.

301
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,899
-Saeroyi.
-However,

302
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,823
you are Mr. Park's son, so maybe

303
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,701
I should pin my hopes on you.

304
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,126
What I trust more than your words
and my discerning eye

305
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,670
is Chairman Jang's intuition.

306
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,672
Your pub, DanBam, did you say?

307
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,467
Yes.

308
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,470
Jea Foods, Hyeonil Foods,
Soso Brothers, and so on.

309
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,596
Do you know about them?

310
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,931
They're top restaurant companies.

311
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,892
Chairman Jang eats at their restaurants.

312
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,437
One percent, two billion won.
That's very ambitious of you,

313
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,191
but you can't persuade me
with such numbers.

314
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,908
Make him dine at your tiny pub.

315
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
That's your mission.

316
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,542
If you prove to me
that you can get on his nerves,

317
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,632
then I'll put my trust in you.

318
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,469
I wanted to see you.

319
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,514
I can see

320
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,974
his back.

321
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,853
I really wanted to meet you too.

322
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,785
You've completed your mission.

323
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,955
-I owe it all to you.
-It was a lucky move.

324
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,333
He wouldn't even have glanced at you
if you didn't put in the investment.

325
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,798
He came because I was the one
who made the investment.

326
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,842
You do have a point.

327
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,012
You withdrew from other investments
and bought more Jangga Co. stock.

328
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,432
Doesn't that mean
you've already made up your mind?

329
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,684
Hey.

330
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:02,936
Yes.

331
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,022
Don't people call you obnoxious?

332
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,820
No, never.

333
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,530
You can be a little obnoxious.

334
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,617
Maybe that's your charm.

335
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
Fine.

336
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,041
Shall we join hands?

337
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,670
-Then...
-Yes.

338
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,007
Together, we'll take down
Chairman Jang and Geun-won.

339
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,467
Let's do it.

340
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,598
I look forward to it, partner.

341
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,897
Likewise.

342
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,408
Did you ask me to stop by just to play go?

343
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,163
I felt like I've been neglecting you.

344
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,250
I'm over 40 now.
You don't need to look after me.

345
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,003
You're so cold.

346
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,339
I'm getting old,

347
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,593
so I'm not as energetic as I used to be.
I have many worries.

348
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,055
Maybe I don't have
that much time left to live.

349
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,099
I think about Bo-hyeon, your father,
often these days.

350
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,272
You're still healthy. You'll live long.

351
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,193
I've lived long enough,
so I don't have many regrets.

352
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,654
But I'm worried about the company
after I die.

353
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,239
I don't know if I can leave it
in Geun-won's hands.

354
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,875
The latest trend is hiring
a competent management specialist.

355
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,880
It's not easy for me to say this, but...

356
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,927
I hope you don't insist on
passing it on to your son.

357
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,888
Even internally, there are many

358
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,723
who are more capable than Geun-won.

359
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,102
The company's success
should be our top priority, you know.

360
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,064
Then I suppose...

361
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,984
You will be

362
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,613
most suited for the position.

363
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:28,915
I lost.

364
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,169
You're now on par with me.

365
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,380
It was a good game.

366
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,257
You should stay for lunch.

367
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,301
I made other plans.
Please invite me again another time.

368
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,848
Min-jung.

369
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,228
You're like family to me.
I'm very fond of you.

370
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,858
And as the chairman of Jangga Co.,

371
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,944
I'm always grateful for how much
you care about the company.

372
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,537
You're the only one I trust,
so keep up the great work.

373
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,417
I always trust you and do as you say, sir.

374
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,154
It looked like they had met before.

375
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,282
This is quite hurtful.

376
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,456
What a pity.

377
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,591
His relationship with Jangga Co...

378
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,677
It may look like

379
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,014
he's a show-off and a narcissist.

380
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,976
But those stocks...
And the first punch?

381
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,023
He had planned all this eight years ago.

382
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,860
The fight I have no idea about.

383
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,197
And it's really annoying.

384
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,408
Hey, Ho-jin.

385
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,077
No, I'm not busy.

386
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,453
Your office?

387
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,747
I'll be right there.

388
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,211
I need to go somewhere.

389
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,296
Where?

390
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,509
I need to meet someone.

391
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,969
Can't I go with you?

392
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,514
-You don't know what it's about.
-What is it about?

393
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,063
Geun-soo, close up
and go home with Yi-seo.

394
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:57,981
Okay.

395
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,083
Do you even know what kind of relationship
your brother has with our boss?

396
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,007
Yi-seo.

397
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,093
You know what happened

398
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,721
between Saeroyi and my family, don't you?

399
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:34,851
No, I don't.

400
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,061
Really?

401
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,356
I really don't know.

402
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,904
Yes, you do.

403
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,363
What is it?

404
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,741
Are you deaf?

405
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,993
I told you that I don't know.

406
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,163
Why the fuck are you asking me
about your family?

407
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,125
What's going on?

408
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,044
What's the matter?

409
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,633
-Mind your own business.
-What?

410
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,387
What am I going to do with that rude brat?

411
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,807
I only asked her one question!

412
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,809
My gosh.

413
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:23,816
STOCK OWNERSHIP RATIO
OF CHAIRMAN JANG'S PEOPLE

414
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,076
I think we made a move a bit too early.

415
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,661
Why?

416
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,707
There are those who support the chairman
and those who support Ms. Kang like us.

417
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,085
And when it comes
to the stock ownership ratio,

418
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,463
we own about 12 percent less than they do.

419
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,425
Many people in the company
have a lot of trust in Chairman Jang.

420
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,847
Then we should make him lose their trust.

421
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,810
-How?
-You know what I'm talking about.

422
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,397
The detective?

423
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,273
Do you think it'll work?

424
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,192
He ignores you every time you visit.

425
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,737
I'll just have to keep trying.

426
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,119
JANGGA PUB TARGETS CHINA
TO BE THEIR NEXT MARKET

427
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,288
You asked for me?

428
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,461
The Best Pub.

429
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,548
Why did you pay them money?

430
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,385
They should be paying us instead.

431
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,597
This?

432
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,727
Saeroyi wanted to be on the show as well.

433
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,812
So I paid them to kick him off the show.

434
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,147
Why would you do that?

435
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,066
Pardon?

436
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,776
Well...

437
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,071
I didn't want to risk
losing the competition...

438
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,161
This is why people think
you're incompetent.

439
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,246
You fool.

440
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,749
Sorry?

441
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,627
By doing that, you just admitted
that he's better than us.

442
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,590
Why can't you be more sophisticated?

443
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,262
I'm sorry.

444
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,473
Get out.

445
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,359
My successor.

446
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,528
Lack of competence.

447
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,994
I can never talk to that old man.

448
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,042
Hey.

449
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,629
What do you think you're doing here?

450
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,388
-Am I not allowed to be here?
-What was that, you jerk?

451
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,849
Dad asked me to come.

452
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,230
Why?

453
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,445
Why did he ask you to come?

454
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,159
Are you nervous?

455
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,912
You must be fucking crazy.

456
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,923
You haven't hit me in ages, brother.

457
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,675
What?

458
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,010
"Brother"?

459
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,346
As a kid, I didn't get why you'd hit me.

460
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,934
But I guess you were just nervous.

461
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,437
You must've lost your mind.

462
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,990
Don't get so scared.

463
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,576
I'm not even interested.

464
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,421
Damn it.

465
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,154
What happened to your face?

466
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,240
You always asked me that when I was young.

467
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,537
FOREIGN STUDIES EDUCATION CONSULTING

468
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,081
Study abroad and meet your mom
while you're there.

469
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,462
What kind of relationship

470
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,173
do you have with Saeroyi?

471
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,927
I only came to ask you that.

472
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,515
As you've already seen, we don't have
a very amicable relationship.

473
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,433
What's the reason

474
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,435
for that?

475
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,730
Why are you asking me

476
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,524
instead of asking him?

477
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,237
Because I'm scared.

478
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,947
You're scared?

479
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,531
Because the atrocious side

480
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,701
is probably our family.

481
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,040
Don't worry.

482
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,125
I'm not the bad guy.

483
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,215
Here's my favorite idiom.

484
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,426
"The strong prey on the weak."

485
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,221
"The strong prey on the weak."

486
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,057
Who do you think decides

487
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,269
the good side or the bad side?

488
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,854
The winner gets to decide.

489
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,482
And I've always won.

490
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,531
A carp that's raised in a fishbowl

491
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,742
only grows as big as your hand.

492
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,622
But a carp that lives in a river

493
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,042
grows up to over one meter.

494
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,877
-I'm--
-Did you move out

495
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,546
only to be a waiter at a tiny pub?

496
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,716
You're my son.

497
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,554
You may be an illegitimate son,
but I won't let you live a useless life.

498
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,519
I'm going to leave.

499
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,895
I want you to quit--

500
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,063
Listen!

501
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,993
I don't want to live like you.

502
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,375
I'll be off now.

503
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,047
And one more thing.

504
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,801
I don't know what happened
between you two.

505
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,183
But are you really sure

506
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,561
that DanBam is a small fishbowl?

507
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,522
What?

508
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,068
Saeroyi

509
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,447
is a lot stronger than you think.

510
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,878
I told you.

511
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,463
Don't worry about me.

512
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,007
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

513
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,930
So that you won't suffer,

514
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,974
I'll...

515
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,518
destroy Jangga Co.

516
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,735
WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

517
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,113
Call Saeroyi.

518
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,033
Calling Saeroyi.

519
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,019
Did something happen?

520
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,647
What? No.

521
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,318
You?

522
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,778
No, me neither.

523
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,035
How did you save up all that money?

524
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:37,912
What?

525
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:41,916
It's a secret.

526
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,793
Is it because I work at Jangga Co.?

527
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,922
No, that's not why.

528
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,217
I just don't want you to get involved

529
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,094
in this fight
between me and Chairman Jang.

530
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,888
Whatever.

531
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,224
You already got me involved.

532
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,981
Sometimes,

533
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,567
I get confused.

534
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,906
I know I work at Jangga Co.

535
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,076
And I always do my best for the company.

536
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,163
But when you told me
that you'll make me quit,

537
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,250
it made me really happy.

538
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,549
I sometimes wish you'd stop this fight,

539
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,425
but then I find myself rooting for you.

540
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,303
As I stand between you and Jangga Co.,

541
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,597
I don't know what to do

542
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,350
or whose side I'm on.

543
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,022
It sounds weird now that I've said it.

544
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,567
I feel so two-faced.

545
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,160
Did I ever tell you why I like you?

546
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,121
What?

547
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,957
Remember back in high school?

548
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,042
You were late
to your university interview,

549
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,045
so you ran all the way there.

550
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,714
Oh, right.

551
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,925
You told me that you didn't need my help,

552
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,595
and you persistently ran
the entire way there.

553
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,472
In the end, you got there in time.

554
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,350
And as I saw you going inside from behind,

555
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,185
I could sense

556
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,023
that you were
an incredibly independent person

557
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,859
who knew how to take care of yourself.

558
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,864
I was impressed.

559
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,581
Don't get swayed.

560
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,876
You don't need to be on anyone's side
but your own.

561
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,341
Okay.

562
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,096
DANBAM

563
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,056
Hello.

564
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,063
Toni, you can greet them.

565
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,064
Okay.

566
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,607
Hello.

567
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,484
Welcome to DanBam.

568
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,588
I don't understand what he's saying.

569
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,632
What?

570
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,926
Isn't he speaking English?

571
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,386
Hurry up and talk to him.

572
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,933
I don't speak English.

573
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,436
Well...

574
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,940
Then who does?

575
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,775
Why?

576
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,362
Why can't you speak English
when you look like

577
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,738
someone that would?

578
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,074
Because I'm Korean.

579
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,328
But it's only been a year
since you came here.

580
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,372
Where were you before that?

581
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,498
Guinea.

582
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,043
-So I'm fluent in French.
-I see.

583
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:19,133
Yi-seo will flip out if she finds out.

584
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,760
She's going to fire you for sure.

585
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,691
Do you like Saeroyi?

586
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,031
I'm just curious.

587
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,494
It's already weird that you gave up
going to college to work at DanBam.

588
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,333
What if I do like him?

589
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,800
It doesn't matter, right?

590
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,344
What do you mean?

591
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,765
I know you like me.

592
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,481
But you probably never

593
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,025
even thought of dating me
in the first place.

594
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,528
You know what?

595
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,948
I was friendly to you
because I knew your family is rich.

596
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,328
I figured you'd eventually
be an asset to me.

597
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,750
But in the end,
you just turned out be a loser

598
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,379
who had no balls to go after me
or the company.

599
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,762
You're talking nonsense.

600
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,265
You're probably satisfied
with what you have.

601
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,644
You want to know if I like Saeroyi?

602
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,106
Yes, I do.

603
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,069
But it's not like I'm crazy about him.

604
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,031
Emotions are shallow and inconsistent.

605
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,200
They change according to the situation.

606
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,794
That means you've still got a shot.

607
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,088
What?

608
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,132
By any chance...

609
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:29,888
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

610
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,144
you should take over Jangga Co.

611
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,028
I'm kidding.

612
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,406
Let's go.

613
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,043
She's so mean.

614
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,758
Toni.

615
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,345
Do you like working here?

616
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,099
Yes, it's fun. I really like it.

617
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,854
Then learn

618
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,523
how to speak English.

619
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,691
What?

620
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,943
English?

621
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,946
Hey, you're back early.

622
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,573
You're all here.

623
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,199
Yes, well...

624
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,493
How did it go?

625
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,413
We can't get the display stand.
But we got an ice machine.

626
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,624
That's great.
I felt bad having to borrow it

627
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,500
from next door every weekend.

628
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,754
-Great work.
-You're going somewhere again?

629
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,047
Yes, I need to go.

630
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,965
What is it this time?

631
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,759
It's urgent. I'll be right back.

632
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,135
I'll see you guys.

633
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,304
-Okay.
-Okay, see you.

634
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,893
Today's a weekday,
so you don't need me, right?

635
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,144
What? Why?

636
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,362
-I need to go somewhere.
-Go ahead.

637
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,072
Yes, we'll do fine without you.

638
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,531
-Thank you!
-Sure. Go on.

639
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,951
Go ahead. Gosh, that was close.

640
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,375
By the way, what's going on

641
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,793
between our boss and Yi-seo?

642
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,379
What do you think?
It's the boss and the manager.

643
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,923
What's wrong? Do you sense something?

644
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,259
It's hard to explain.

645
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,554
Forget that. You need to hurry up
and learn how to speak English.

646
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,514
Get to your senses.

647
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,518
Yes, you should stay away from Yi-seo
for a while.

648
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,480
Boss.

649
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,148
Boss!

650
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,237
What's the emergency?

651
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,364
Isn't it about work?

652
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,782
It's something personal.

653
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,867
You always make up things like that.

654
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,203
You told us at the team dinner.

655
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,581
It's hard to do it alone,
but you can do it because you have us.

656
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,125
I don't know anything

657
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,211
about the shares or the relationship
between Jangga Co. and DanBam.

658
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,588
Am I really the manager of DanBam?

659
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,465
You said you needed me.

660
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,801
Can you not trust me?

661
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,095
I'm smart.

662
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,849
I want to be supportive.

663
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,728
Even if it's something personal,
if it's burdensome,

664
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,022
you can share a bit of that with me.

665
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,698
It might have something to do
with work in a way.

666
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,659
It's quite far,
and you might feel uncomfortable.

667
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,953
Do you want to come?

668
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,375
I'd love to.

669
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,595
FROM NAMBU TERMINAL TO PAJIN

670
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,891
It's a long story. And it's boring.

671
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,102
It's okay. Tell me everything.

672
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,524
When I was little,

673
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,445
I lived alone with my dad.

674
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,615
On the running bus,

675
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,576
he kept talking.

676
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,662
What his dad meant to him.

677
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,417
Jang Geun-won.

678
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,295
I'll resign, sir.

679
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,380
Dad.

680
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,549
The ill-fated relationship
with Chairman Jang.

681
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,886
The death of his dad caused by them.

682
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,388
The hidden truth.

683
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,851
The hellÂ he went through later on.

684
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,772
His friend named Lee Ho-jin.

685
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,483
His plans for revenge.

686
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,694
And the time he spent for his plans.

687
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,447
He kept telling me

688
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,200
composedly and incessantly

689
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,869
about what he's been through.

690
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,873
And I listened carefully.

691
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,960
I just listened.

692
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,050
Why did we come here?

693
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,261
To meet someone.

694
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,347
Because it's winter.

695
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,517
You should wear it for long in winter.

696
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,019
Make sure to keep it clean.

697
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,899
It's been a long time.
Have you been doing well?

698
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,025
Saeroyi!

699
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,778
Hye-won.

700
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,613
You're so big. You've been well?

701
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:39,948
Yes.

702
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,326
What? Where are you going, Dad?

703
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,162
Dad.

704
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,790
Why do you keep coming
when he hates you?

705
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,043
Because I want him on my side.

706
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,464
Help yourself.

707
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,176
Take some if you need them.

708
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,138
Is he our supplier?

709
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,391
Yes. These are what my dad prepared.

710
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,938
My pub is doing well thanks to you.

711
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,900
Gosh, you've finally achieved your dream.

712
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,153
This is just the beginning.

713
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,949
What's your dream, Hye-won?

714
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,201
A cop.

715
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,744
I want to be a cop.

716
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,172
That sounds cool.

717
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,050
I also wanted to be a cop as a kid.

718
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,636
What? Why did you not become one?

719
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,721
Hye-won. If you're done,

720
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,224
can you go gather up the laundry
before the sun sets?

721
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,517
Okay.

722
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,860
Yi-seo, will you go help Hye-won?

723
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,029
Sure.

724
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,676
She seems brave and kind.

725
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,103
Unlike you, Officer Oh.

726
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,524
I'm not a cop anymore.

727
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,192
Don't call me that.

728
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,570
When I first met you,

729
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,324
you were a cop in charge of my dad's case.

730
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,994
Wake up, you punk.

731
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,123
Get to your senses
if you want to keep your job.

732
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,629
Isn't your daughter
turning one next month?

733
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,216
Don't let that useless sense of justice
get the best of you.

734
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,844
You should think about your family.

735
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,556
Therefore, according to Article 254
of the Criminal Law,

736
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,851
the defendant will be sentenced
to three years in prison.

737
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,231
And you didn't finish the case yet.

738
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,209
I'm really sorry.

739
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,422
Please stop...

740
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,594
Please stop coming here.

741
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,765
Get up.

742
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,477
I will do anything.

743
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,562
I'll do anything

744
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,814
to make it up to you.

745
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,317
I'll do anything you want.

746
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,819
Whether it's tens or hundreds
of millions of won,

747
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,822
I'll pay the money
no matter how long it takes.

748
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,990
Make it up to me?

749
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,715
The only thing

750
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,260
you can do for me

751
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,764
is turning yourself in
and coming clean.

752
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,479
You should

753
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,107
at least be an honorable dad

754
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,567
who can support his daughter's dream.

755
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,570
No. But it's just...

756
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,782
Without me, Hye-won will--

757
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,991
I'm

758
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,702
a businessman.

759
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,123
You should pay the price.

760
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,999
Don't try to shrink your debt.

761
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,212
You're not

762
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,342
supposed to say that to me, right?

763
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,436
If the guy testifies...

764
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,064
What?

765
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,942
Jang Geun-won will be put in prison,

766
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,738
and you will get the stockholders
on Chairman Jang's side on yours.

767
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,532
Is that your plan?

768
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,287
You're awake?

769
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,749
So did it go well?

770
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,667
No.

771
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,253
I knew it.

772
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,507
If he could be moved with compassion,

773
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,967
he wouldn't have carried
a false investigation.

774
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,678
We'll have to wait and see.

775
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,536
What are you doing?

776
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,414
I can't sleep on the bare floor.

777
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,416
Just stay like this for a while.

778
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,428
We should get going
before the last bus leaves.

779
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,189
What is this scar?

780
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:33,653
I got hurt when I worked
on the deep-sea fishing vessel.

781
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,534
And what about this one?

782
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,245
When I did manual labor.

783
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,423
You must've had a hard time all alone.

784
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,818
A little.

785
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,204
What?

786
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,874
As I felt heartbroken

787
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,501
by his past...

788
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,963
Why are you crying?

789
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,926
I realized my feelings for him

790
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,223
was love.

791
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,323
As I heard his calm voice,

792
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,454
I got really emotional.

793
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,376
I didn't want to let him
suffer alone ever again.

794
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,588
I decided to kill

795
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,549
those who mess with this guy.

796
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,992
I love him.

797
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,040
I really do.

798
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:14,165
JANGGA'S TRIPE, JANGGA RAMEN

799
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,418
The business is going well, right?

800
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,549
This is the main street on the weekend.

801
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,842
It has to go well.

802
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,594
I guess you're right.

803
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:28,846
Are you on your way to work?

804
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,764
Yes.

805
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,684
I was on my way to DanBam to get some ice.
I'll come with you.

806
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,562
How shameless you are.

807
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,022
What?

808
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,818
I heard the whole thing from Mr. Park.

809
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,320
The relationship between Jangga Co.
and him.

810
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,950
He rarely talks about himself.

811
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,285
I guess he trusts you.

812
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,414
Were you involved
in the stock purchasing too?

813
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,959
Why? So that you can go and tell them?

814
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,212
I can tell you hate me.

815
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,672
It's nothing surprising.

816
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,843
Too bad. I don't hate you.

817
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,474
Will you give me some ice?

818
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,394
No.

819
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,275
Boss.

820
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:24,735
You're here.

821
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,488
Why did you two come together?

822
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,241
I'm here to get some ice.

823
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,201
Will you talk to Geun-soo?

824
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,251
What's the matter?

825
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,670
He's the building owner.

826
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,130
Oh, hello.

827
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,590
Hello.

828
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,676
Anyway, that's what's going to happen.

829
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,682
What's going on?

830
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,112
I can do that.

831
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,156
No, it's okay.

832
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,494
He sold the building.

833
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,121
And the new building owner

834
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,831
wants to raise the rent.

835
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,875
How much?

836
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:21,959
By five percent.

837
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,377
Five percent?

838
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,629
How much is it?

839
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,547
How much would it be?

840
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,259
The current rent is 5,940,000 won.
So five percent is...

841
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,802
It's 297,000 won.

842
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,432
That's just too much.

843
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:37,767
I know.

844
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:39,644
Isn't it a breach of contract?

845
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,188
What's worse is that

846
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,149
he wants us to move out
when the contract runs out.

847
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:47,109
-What?
-He wants to run his business here.

848
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,278
That's ridiculous.

849
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,199
When does the contract run out?

850
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,576
I took it over,
so it runs out in half a year.

851
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,537
-Can I take a look at it?
-Sure.

852
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,291
There's no legal issue
on the rent increase.

853
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,044
They can raise it
by up to five percent every year.

854
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,005
They are just like muggers.

855
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,509
Stop staring at me.

856
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,344
Once our lease is up,

857
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,845
do we have to move out?

858
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:16,847
Well...

859
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,016
It doesn't say much about the conditions.

860
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,561
If you ask him to renew the contract,
you can stay.

861
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,563
It's a unilateral termination.

862
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,067
There's a law protecting the tenants.
You can be protected for five years.

863
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,486
It's a good thing.

864
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:31,612
What is it then?

865
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,364
We don't have to move out, do we?

866
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,744
But no good can come
from arguing with the building owner.

867
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,206
You better work things out well.

868
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,419
But it bothers me that the new owner
wants to run his business here.

869
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,838
That's what bothers me too.

870
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:52,800
It happens a lot. Owners often kick out
tenants to run their business.

871
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,138
It means they want to take the premium.

872
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,974
The premium is more than 100 million.
That's absurd.

873
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,310
If you can't findÂ a new tenant
within the last 3 months,

874
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,562
then you're done.

875
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,148
You can assert your legal rights

876
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:08,607
for the last three months--

877
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,026
It means,

878
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,486
we have to move out.

879
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,366
We've done the marketing work.

880
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,076
Even if we get the premium,

881
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,619
it's our loss once we move out.

882
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,247
I have the number
of the new building owner.

883
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,707
I'll try to convince him.

884
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,754
Damn it.

885
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:39,472
NEW BUILDING OWNER

886
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,311
Hello?

887
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:50,524
Hello. I'm the owner of DanBam in Itaewon,
Park Saeroyi.

888
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,902
I heard you took over the building.

889
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,779
So I'm calling you to say hello.

890
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,030
Okay.

891
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,032
What a coincidence.

892
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,241
Pardon?

893
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,748
It's me.

894
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,542
Jang Dae-hee.

895
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,203
Is it Jangga Co.?

896
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,038
Getting rid of someoneÂ they hate.

897
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,623
He is a man of huge caliber.

898
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,917
Yi-seo, another word
and I won't let it go.

899
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,796
You and the girl named Yi-seo.
I didn't know you were so emotional.

900
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,631
Why don't you shut down the business?

901
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,007
There's one way.

902
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,175
No way.

903
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,761
What do you want me to do?

904
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:04,014
-Get on your knees and apologize.
-Getting expelled and kicked out?

905
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:07,184
You took absolutely nothing from me.

906
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,980
I'm really sorry
for what my family has done to you.

907
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,441
Geun-soo says he'll talk to his dad
on condition that he quits DanBam.

908
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,776
What do you think?

909
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,736
Of course I agree with it.

910
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,698
You don't deserve

911
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,367
to be the manager here.
