EPISODE 2

4
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,824
GWANGJIN HOSPITAL

5
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,593
Where? Where are you?

6
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,888
Okay. I have to go.

7
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,682
He's at the hospital, Gwangjin Hospital.

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,226
-Go to the hospital.
-Okay.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,231
Calm down
and call the police--

10
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,573
Can we please go a little faster?

11
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,408
Okay.

12
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,595
What are you doing?

13
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,932
How did you...

14
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,395
Now that you seem startled,
it's just obvious.

15
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,773
Wait. Hang on a second.

16
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:33,987
It's you, right?

17
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,534
Wait.

18
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,621
Let's talk it out. Calm down.

19
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,168
-Why did you not call the hospital?
-No.

20
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,587
It's not like that. Let's talk it out.
Let go!

21
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,343
Why is someone else being punished?

22
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,012
Help!

23
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,515
Help me!

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,398
Hang on. Wait and just listen to me.

25
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,776
You jerk.

26
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,197
Why did you kill my dad?

27
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,660
Why?

28
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,499
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,127
I'm really sorry.

30
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,182
Please stop. I'm so sorry.

31
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,438
It's too late.

32
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,611
The one you should apologize to

33
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,364
is dead.

34
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,328
Wait. Please don't do this.

35
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,040
You killed him.

36
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,292
You have to

37
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,920
go apologize to him.

38
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,508
You have to die!

39
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,135
Die!

40
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,930
Go ahead and die!

41
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,934
Die! Die, you jerk!

42
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,478
Damn it.

43
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,648
You son of a bitch.

44
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,097
Die, you jerk!

45
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
Stop!

46
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,812
Put that down.

47
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,527
Park Saeroyi!

48
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,118
Put it down at once!

49
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,496
This bastard killed my dad.

50
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:32,957
Okay.

51
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,585
I'll investigate it,
so put that down first.

52
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,504
I said this son of a bitch killed my dad!

53
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,881
Put it down!

54
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,927
Saeroyi, put that down first, okay?

55
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,978
Stop here, okay?

56
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,066
Enough. Please!
Will you become a murderer because of him?

57
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,152
Listen to your friend.
This won't change anything.

58
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,946
I understand how you feel.
Calm down first.

59
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,531
Give me a break.

60
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,910
-What do you understand?
-Please.

61
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,372
-Put it down when I'm being nice.
-If not, then what?

62
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,336
Put it down.

63
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,590
You can shoot.

64
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,009
You see,

65
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,845
I don't care about anything anymore.

66
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,183
Goddamnit.

67
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,978
Wait.

68
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,773
-Hold on.
-Move!

69
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,358
Don't shoot him.

70
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,111
Soo-ah, step aside.

71
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,448
You crazy asshole.

72
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,160
No one wants this.

73
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,001
What do you even know?

74
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,505
My dad is dead!

75
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,384
I may not understand how you feel,

76
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,555
but I know how your dad
will feel about this.

77
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,183
He will never want you to ruin your life

78
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,146
by getting back at a scumbag like him
to avenge his death.

79
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,400
He'll never want you to do that.

80
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,696
You know that I'm right.

81
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,200
You know that better
than anybody else.

82
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,291
Right?

83
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,755
I wanted you to be confident.

84
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,507
And today, I could see

85
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,344
you were already living like that.

86
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,726
You have no idea how proud I was.

87
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,692
I want you to keep
living like that, my son.

88
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,183
Damn it.

89
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,619
Dad...

90
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,121
Dad!

91
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,208
Dad!

92
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,211
Dad...

93
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,148
Dad...

94
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,214
GWANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

95
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,209
And just like that,

96
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,132
my dad's funeral

97
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,554
came to an end.

98
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,486
GWANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

99
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,239
Hey, I have big news.

100
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,491
The new kid's dad
passed away, right?

101
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,743
It was because Geun-won hit him
with his car.

102
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,204
Geun-won got hospitalized
because of a car accident.

103
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,707
The new kid went to the hospital
and threw a huge fit.

104
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,874
How do you know that?

105
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,293
My mom works at that hospital.

106
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,629
Maybe he was just angry
that he got expelled.

107
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,965
How could Geun-won get away with murder?

108
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,551
Maybe you're right.

109
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,512
But who knows? His dad can cover up
pretty much everything.

110
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,515
-Yes, that's true.
-But think about it.

111
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,477
He got expelled because of Geun-won.

112
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,857
The new kid only hit Geun-won
because he wouldn't stop.

113
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,322
34GA7777

114
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,856
GYEONGGI NORTHERN DETENTION CENTER

115
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,319
DO NOT FORGET THIS DAY
GYEONGGI NORTHERN DETENTION CENTER

116
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,911
I'm sorry about your father.

117
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,997
But

118
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,083
you can't just take out
your anger on my son.

119
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,585
Don't you agree?

120
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,800
Why are you here?

121
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,807
I've known your father for 20 years.

122
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,267
So it hurts me to see you

123
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,103
locked up like this.

124
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,485
But you see,

125
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,904
to see you misbehave at school

126
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,867
and not self-reflect about your actions

127
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,621
makes me want to correct you
for some reason.

128
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,039
I asked you why you're here.

129
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,794
Just like before, I'm here

130
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,421
to give you a second chance.

131
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,468
-A second chance?
-What do you say?

132
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,096
If you self-reflect

133
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,682
and apologize to my son on your knees--

134
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,239
Your son is the one

135
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,368
who should get on his knees.

136
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,507
How interesting.

137
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,053
Is this how your father taught you?

138
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,562
Let me give you a word of advice
out of affection.

139
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,814
Beliefs.

140
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,733
Ambition.

141
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,278
Theyâ€™re words used by those
who have nothing but their ego.

142
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,448
If you gain nothing,

143
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,201
that's just being stubborn and foolish.

144
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,338
I'll leave you to self-reflect in prison.

145
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,937
The chief took care of the detective

146
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,897
who secured the CCTV footage.

147
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,984
The public defender in charge also thinks
the best option is to reduce his sentence.

148
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,866
He's fearless.

149
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,160
Pardon?

150
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,412
It's very strange.

151
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,499
He gets on my nerves for some reason.

152
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,460
Are you talking about Park Saeroyi?

153
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,006
Who's the student you mentioned?
The girl who talked about Geun-won's car.

154
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,011
Her name is Oh Soo-ah.
She's your son's classmate.

155
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,932
She grew up at the orphanage
that was once sponsored by the company.

156
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,393
Is that so?

157
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,317
We already admitted
that the car belonged to your son, sir.

158
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,780
But we clarified on the report
that the gardener had borrowed his car.

159
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,283
Her testimony will be useless.
You don't need to be bothered by it.

160
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,786
Is she friends

161
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,122
with Saeroyi?

162
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,999
From what I know, yes.

163
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,377
Then arrange a meeting with her.

164
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,087
Okay, sir.

165
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,771
You actually look familiar.

166
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,607
I think I saw you a couple of times
at the orphanage.

167
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,903
Yes.

168
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,448
Are you friends with Geun-won?

169
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,450
We're classmates.

170
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,953
And are you also friends with Saeroyi?

171
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,541
Yes.

172
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,798
Our company runs a foundation.

173
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,219
We'd like to pay for your admission fee
and living expenses.

174
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,638
What do you think?

175
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,974
I have

176
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,518
enough money for my tuition.

177
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,145
That won't be enough.

178
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,774
You need money for rent
and other living expenses.

179
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,237
And in return?

180
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,243
"In return"?

181
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,043
Do I need to testify against Saeroyi?

182
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,143
How interesting.

183
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,023
Actually, no.

184
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,943
This is actually very sad.

185
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,987
You must've lived such a difficult life

186
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,365
to think that way.

187
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,705
I'm just trying to do a good deed.
Don't get the wrong idea.

188
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,584
You're free to testify what you saw.

189
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,297
Mr. Kim, I want you to enroll her
in our financial support program.

190
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,008
-Okay, sir.
-Dad, I--

191
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,848
You may go now.

192
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,851
-I'll be off.
-What's going on?

193
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,228
What are you doing here?

194
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,606
What are you doing here?
You should be at the hospital.

195
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,943
I came to tell you something.

196
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,113
Soo-ah.

197
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,615
If...

198
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,492
If by any chance...

199
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,956
Yes?

200
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,877
If I really did ask you
something in return,

201
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,589
what would you have done?

202
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
Dad.

203
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,267
I'm joking.

204
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,853
I'll see you again.

205
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,913
Why did you call Soo-ah here?

206
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,248
Go back to the hospital.

207
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,670
Please let him free.

208
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,299
-What?
-Please free Saeroyi from jail.

209
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,385
This all happened because of me.

210
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,846
Because of you?

211
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,974
I hit his dad...

212
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,106
Mr. Kim is already getting punished

213
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,986
on your behalf
for having murdered Mr. Park.

214
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,905
-Dad.
-Enough!

215
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,085
I selected you as my successor.

216
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,839
But I still have another son
even though he's a bastard.

217
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,633
That means

218
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,135
you can always be replaced.

219
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,533
I can't have my successor get convicted.

220
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,493
That's absurd. No.

221
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,621
It should never happen.

222
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,249
But if it does,
I'll have to turn to my alternative.

223
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,002
-Dad.
-In order to set him free,

224
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,005
you'll have to admit that it was you.

225
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,468
So tell me.
Do you still want a settlement?

226
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm sorry.

227
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,146
Good choice.

228
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,234
You can't gain anything
with your conscience.

229
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,819
Okay?

230
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,407
This will be a good opportunity.
Follow me.

231
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,708
Do you know what's funny?

232
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,794
Pigs are smarter than dogs.

233
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,715
But nine out of ten people
will still eat pork

234
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,760
even though they're aware of that.

235
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,472
That's because they're delicious.

236
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,311
I don't get the standard of their values.
People eat pork,

237
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,814
but they loathe those who eat dog meat.

238
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,442
But then again,

239
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,696
dogs are very loyal and can be cute.
It's just a matter of perspective.

240
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,865
The employees

241
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,659
and those below you who work for money...

242
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,871
Just think of them as dogs.

243
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,500
Dad.

244
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,343
Look at how big they've grown.

245
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,932
Let's see.

246
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,062
Which one should I cook?

247
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,154
-Let me see.
-Shit!

248
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,044
Dad.

249
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,756
What are you doing?

250
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,594
From killing a chicken
to business management,

251
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,514
you need to do and understand all of it
to become a true owner.

252
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,808
Here.

253
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,186
Now, I'm going to cook this.

254
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,897
I'm going to twist its head and kill it.

255
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,778
Then I'll pluck its feathers,
take out its internal organs,

256
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,407
cut them into pieces,
and fry the pieces in oil.

257
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,495
Here. Go ahead and twist its head.

258
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,710
I can't.

259
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,673
-I can't do it!
-You can't do it?

260
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,010
Aren't you the company's successor?

261
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,265
Do it now!

262
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,585
Twist it properly.

263
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,796
If not,
it'll try to escape with a broken neck.

264
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,303
Park Saeroyi.
I could tell just by looking at him.

265
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,057
I'm sorry to say this,
but you're half the man he is.

266
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,976
But he's just an animal
while you're a human being.

267
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,938
I can't stand the fact

268
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,400
that you feel sorry even though
he beat you up two times in a row.

269
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,573
Think of this chicken as Saeroyi.

270
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,368
If you're my son

271
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,162
and the successor of Jangga Co.,

272
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,290
do not feel sorry

273
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,502
when you're eating pork or chicken.

274
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,184
You can't do it?

275
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,697
I can.

276
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,993
I can do it.

277
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,538
That's right.

278
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,501
You're right, Dad.

279
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,172
Saeroyi

280
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,050
is just a livestock.

281
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,333
TODAY'S TRIAL

282
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,751
Here's the ruling.

283
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,588
The defendant seems to have aimed
to murder the victim

284
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,466
judging by the weapon
and the victimâ€™s condition.

285
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:19,054
Also, he doesnâ€™t admit to his faults
or regrets his actions

286
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,098
even though it was all based on
the defendant's misunderstanding.

287
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,268
The victim's estimated time of death
is 8:20 p.m.

288
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,355
This guy was sweeping the garden.
It doesn't make any sense.

289
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,440
Right.

290
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,192
It doesn't make sense.

291
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,154
You once killed someone through coercion

292
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,281
and even got demoted for that.

293
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,534
How are you on the promotion list?

294
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,704
-Pardon?
-How did you get this?

295
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,041
Did you go through a civilian CCTV footage

296
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,835
without even asking me or the house owner?

297
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,880
-Sir.
-Wake up, you punk.

298
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,134
Get to your senses
if you want to keep your job.

299
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,641
Isn't your daughter
turning one next month?

300
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,228
Don't let that useless sense of justice
get the best of you.

301
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,689
You should think about your family.

302
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,565
Remember.

303
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,275
Your life

304
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,653
depends on the chairman's son.

305
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,910
Therefore, according to Article 254
of the Criminal Law, the defendant

306
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,122
will be sentenced to three years
in prison.

307
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,516
CHUNGCHEONG PRISON

308
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,577
He will be staying here with you.

309
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:10,123
Don't even try to do a hazing ritual.

310
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,669
He's just a little kid.
Why would we mess with a kid?

311
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,880
Don't worry.

312
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,059
Hey, kid.

313
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,812
When you greetÂ adults,

314
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,857
you should get on your knees
and introduce yourself.

315
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,199
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize for what you did.

316
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,661
You little jerk. What are you looking at?

317
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
I should just take out your eyeballs.

318
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,430
What the heck?

319
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,474
Is he a psycho?

320
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,770
Will things become a bit easier

321
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,022
if I get on my knees?

322
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,985
Why is everyone so obsessed
with making me get on my knees?

323
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,827
But,

324
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,079
I'm your son.

325
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,168
Unlike myself,

326
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,588
I wanted you to be confident.

327
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,425
I want you to keep living like that,

328
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,719
my son.

329
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,967
What's wrong with your face?

330
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,810
It's nothing.

331
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,651
Thank you for coming all the way here
to see me.

332
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,200
Is something wrong?

333
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,458
I got accepted to Gwangjin University.

334
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,375
Really?

335
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,836
That's great.
You always wanted to go there.

336
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,638
But why the long face?

337
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,099
Jangga Co.

338
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,728
offered to support me

339
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,064
with a scholarship.

340
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,243
It's because I reported you that day
and stopped you.

341
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,666
That's why they offered me this.

342
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,214
I'm sorry.

343
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,721
I'm not strong like you. I'm a coward.

344
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,020
I'm sorry.

345
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,068
It's okay.

346
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,407
What?

347
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,870
It's true that I hit Geun-won.

348
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,083
And you did the right thing
by calling the cops.

349
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,045
I actually thank you.

350
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,841
If you didn't stop me,

351
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,178
I'd be in here

352
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,848
for murder instead.

353
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:41,936
Saeroyi.

354
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,356
You made a choice.

355
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,401
So just stick to it.

356
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,947
You did nothing wrong.

357
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,256
What do you plan to do
once you get released?

358
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,471
Apparently, an ex-convict

359
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,765
can't be a police officer.

360
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,021
There's a library here,
and it has tons of books.

361
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,232
-Books?
-Yes.

362
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,446
I have a lot of time now,
so I thought I could use this chance

363
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,740
to study and stuff.

364
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,411
Then I found
Chairman Jang's autobiography.

365
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,748
His autobiography?

366
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,541
I was amazed.

367
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,586
Starting out as a small pub
into a huge company...

368
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,923
It made me want to try as well.

369
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,095
You want to start your own restaurant?

370
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,846
Yes.

371
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,682
I see.

372
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,644
Revenge.

373
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,152
No way.

374
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,614
I just wondered

375
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,951
what might be fun.

376
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,788
I've always dreamed
of running my own business.

377
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,415
My heart is pounding with anticipation.

378
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,256
Your cooking skills
are getting better by the day.

379
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,423
This is delicious.

380
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,388
I heard people tell me
that I'm a pretty good cook.

381
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,474
And I just...

382
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,434
I thought it might be fun.

383
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,450
I should go now.

384
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,209
Saeroyi.

385
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,297
Yes?

386
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,758
Why did you

387
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,930
try to make a move on me?

388
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,642
What?

389
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,147
Why did you ask for my number?

390
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,275
Oh, that day?

391
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,364
I'm sorry.
I know you asked me not to like you.

392
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,538
I did because I like you.

393
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,086
Do you still

394
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,713
like me?

395
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,349
I don't like guys who are poor.

396
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,814
Do you plan to make a lot of money?

397
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,197
From this moment on,

398
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,910
my dream is to become rich.

399
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,182
I had a huge hole in my heart.

400
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,144
I was lethargic.

401
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,148
But strangely enough,

402
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,485
I got so easily provoked by him.

403
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,614
It was useless to resent anyone.

404
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,493
Because my dad was already gone.

405
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,999
So that was definitely
the last thing on my mind.

406
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,754
Revenge.

407
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,135
It feels like

408
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,763
that word fills up my empty heart.

409
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,193
I can't...

410
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,780
I can't wait to get out of here.

411
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,124
2 YEARS LATER

412
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,084
There he comes.

413
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,003
-Welcome back, Boss.
-Welcome back, Boss.

414
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,212
All right.

415
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,430
-Here, Boss.
-It's okay. You eat it.

416
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,142
The weather is nice.

417
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,438
Saeroyi, no one's coming?

418
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,441
-No.
-Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

419
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,735
It's okay. I want to take a walk.

420
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,780
Do you? Okay. Get some fresh air.

421
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,240
If you need help, call me anytime.

422
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,618
-I'll see you later.
-Take care.

423
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,384
He looks young.

424
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,719
You seem to care about him.

425
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,596
What does he do?

426
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,474
He's no big deal.

427
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,770
He's just a fearless and reckless guy.

428
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,731
He's a man.

429
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,241
Welcome.

430
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,001
-Would you like to order?
-I'll have tofu stew and soju, please.

431
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,461
Do you need one glass?

432
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,838
Well...

433
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,796
How does it taste?

434
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,854
It's bitter.

435
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,288
Beliefs.

436
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,748
Ambition.

437
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,793
Theyâ€™re words used by those
who have nothing but their ego.

438
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,963
If you gain nothing,

439
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,175
that's just being stubborn and foolish.

440
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,593
DELICIOUS LIFE

441
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,806
Thank you.

442
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,020
Sir, you forgot your book.

443
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,610
Please throw it out. I memorized it all.

444
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,111
Bye.

445
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:19,036
I CAN BEAT HIM

446
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,580
THE SUPERCILIOUS SON
OF JANG'S FAMILY, JANG GEUN-WON

447
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,251
DIRECTOR KANG MIN-JUNG
SAVING FACE OF JANGGA CO.

448
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,678
On the 9th, at Jang's Family Pub,
Jang's Group's leading brand,

449
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,388
there was an assault case.

450
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,724
The assailant assaulted an employee there
as he didn't recognize him.

451
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,060
Surprisingly, the assailant turned out

452
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,187
to be Chairman Jang Dae-hee's son,

453
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,106
Jang Geun-won who is 21 years old.

454
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,151
In a drunken stupor,
he refused to show his ID card

455
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,778
and lashed out at the employee

456
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,282
saying his domestic animal
failed to recognize its owner.

457
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,326
He also struck the employee in the face.

458
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,786
The video spread quickly,

459
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,705
and it led to a plunge
in Jang's stocks

460
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,748
and a nationwide consumer boycott

461
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,710
inflaming public anger.

462
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,754
Seoul, please.

463
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,229
Hello, Saeroyi.

464
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,149
It has taken so long to write to you.

465
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:31,942
I'm sorry.

466
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,820
Thinking about
how you'd be feeling in there,

467
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,656
I was a little hesitant to write you

468
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,491
just to ask how you were doing.

469
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,745
I'm sure you'd tell me

470
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,289
not to worry about anything
with a silly smile.

471
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,791
Are you doing well?

472
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,419
I miss you.

473
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,716
I live in a neighborhood called Itaewon.

474
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,219
I wasn't sure what to say,

475
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,681
so I decided to tell you
about this neighborhood.

476
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,608
Have you been to Itaewon before?

477
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,169
Each year on October 31,

478
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,463
people enjoy a festival
from the States here.

479
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,888
Apparently they try to comfort
the spirits of the dead

480
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,807
and ward off evil spirits.

481
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,564
People are dressed in strange costumes
and bizarre makeup

482
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,651
so evil spirits won't do them harm.

483
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:58,821
This day

484
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,031
is called Halloween.

485
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:06,161
A lot of people come to Itaewon
to celebrate Halloween.

486
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,582
A lot of grown-ups enjoy this festival
in funny costumes.

487
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:16,380
Besides this festival,
Itaewon is still an attractive place.

488
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,969
There are pretty buildings and a diversity
of people from across the world.

489
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,054
It feels like
you're in a foreign country.

490
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,848
And everyone there

491
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,267
looks so free.

492
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,521
It's a place where you can enjoy a walk.

493
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,484
It feels like the whole world
is condensed into this street.

494
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,738
And I fell in love with this place.

495
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,663
When I walk on this street,

496
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,957
I miss you a lot.

497
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,879
The hill we ran down together
on the day of the exam.

498
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,049
The lake where you asked for my number.

499
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,678
And

500
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,181
your shy smile.

501
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,100
I want to see it again.

502
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,770
I'll look forward to that day.

503
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:17,900
I wish you happiness for now and always.
From Oh Soo-ah.

504
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,201
This is so nice.

505
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,693
What? What's that?

506
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,446
My gosh.

507
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,158
Who are you? Who is this?

508
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,919
When did you come out?

509
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,712
Oh Soo-ah?

510
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,007
What...

511
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,595
-How did we...
-It's so good to see you.

512
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,056
Okay.

513
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,350
What a surprise to see you here.

514
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,935
I know.

515
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,479
When did you come out?

516
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,231
Well, it's...

517
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:42,276
-Lose a little weight, you'll be a model.
-Seok-cheon.

518
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,735
Hey, Soo-ah.

519
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,781
Come over here and sit.

520
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,326
Who's this handsome guy?
Is he your boyfriend?

521
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,369
No, he's not.

522
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,665
Then what about you?
Do you have a lover?

523
00:47:56,748 --> 00:48:00,085
-Gosh, no.
-Don't flirt with him.

524
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,461
I'll tell Philip about it.

525
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,464
Gosh, don't be ridiculous.
I was just asking.

526
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,719
And he's not handsome at all.
He looks like a chestnut.

527
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,388
A chestnut? Chestnuts can be sexy.

528
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,933
It pokes you a lot. Gosh, he's so cute.

529
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,435
You never make concessions.

530
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,604
Right. I don't.

531
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,523
You know Seok-cheon.

532
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,234
Yes. I've seen him on TV.

533
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,986
It's amazing to see him in person.

534
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,740
He's a big player in Itaewon.
I learn a lot from him.

535
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,783
That's great.

536
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,460
What did you do after your release?

537
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,213
I've been preparing for things
here and there.

538
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,548
Prepare?

539
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,092
What about you? Do you go to college?

540
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,345
Yes.

541
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,972
I'll start working next year.

542
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,557
Oh, already?

543
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,978
I'll be working at Jangga Co.

544
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,942
I see.

545
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,404
You said you'd open your own business.
Have you been working on that?

546
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,449
Well, kind of.

547
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,701
I see. Where would it be?

548
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,622
I was going to go around

549
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,540
and think about it.

550
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,460
But I like this place.

551
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,003
What?

552
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,421
Itaewon?

553
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,756
Yes.

554
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,842
Itaewon? Well...

555
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,512
It wouldn't be a good place
for you to start a business.

556
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,515
There's a big difference
between weekdays and weekends.

557
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,684
Compared to the downtown areas,

558
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,519
people leave the place early.

559
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,521
Good locations
have a high premium.

560
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,232
Of course the rent and deposit
are very expensive.

561
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,694
I like this place.

562
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:49,987
I love it.

563
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,993
-When will you start?
-In seven years.

564
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,830
Are you all right?

565
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,748
Sorry.

566
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,667
That was cool. It's okay.

567
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:10,215
So seven years? It's a long time.
What are you going to do until then?

568
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,383
Deep-sea fishing.

569
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,973
Are you doing this on purpose?

570
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,225
I'm really sorry.

571
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,353
It's really hard for an ex-convict
to become a seaman.

572
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,272
I barely got the certificate.

573
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,820
Why do you want to go deep-sea fishing?

574
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:35,574
I'm a middle school graduate ex-convict.
I don't have many career options.

575
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,662
Well...

576
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,583
When you were put in jail,

577
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:49,337
I helped you liquidate your dad's store
and claim for the insurance money.

578
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,924
It was a significant amount.

579
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,803
Besides the money,

580
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,474
he also saved some money
for my college fund.

581
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,977
Then why would you go deep-sea fishing?

582
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,070
It's the price of my dad's life.

583
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,700
It should be more meaningful.

584
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,834
When are you leaving?

585
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,587
-Next week.
-Next week?

586
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,672
How long will you stay in Itaewon?

587
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,341
I'll leave on the first bus.

588
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,551
Really?

589
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:42,891
All right then.
Let's have fun all night long.

590
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,893
Okay.

591
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,618
For the first time after that night,

592
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,705
I could be free

593
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,375
from a whirlpool of emotion

594
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,380
like tormenting yearnings

595
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,509
and revengeful thoughts.

596
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,513
In one, two, and three.

597
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,903
My first time in Itaewon.

598
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,659
My first Halloween

599
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,871
with my first love.

600
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,757
It was a perfect day for me

601
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,178
who was about to go

602
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,849
on a long journey.

603
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,360
Shall we keep going straight ahead?

604
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,279
Yes.

605
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,947
Keep going straight.

606
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,325
All right.

607
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,368
I'm heavy, aren't I?

608
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,623
No, you're not.
You should gain some weight.

609
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,877
I'm sorry.

610
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,464
Seriously, you're not heavy.

611
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,509
I'm sorry.

612
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,554
What are you sorry for?

613
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,141
I know

614
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,103
what Jangga Co. means to you.

615
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,607
You can resent me.

616
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,113
Don't be silly.

617
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:08,245
You said you wish me happiness
for now and always.

618
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,373
What?

619
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,501
After I lost my dad,

620
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,046
I felt like I was left alone in prison.

621
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,675
But this very sentence in your letter

622
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,052
meant a lot to me.

623
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,181
There's no way I can resent you.

624
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,352
You're just living your life.

625
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,188
And I'm always grateful.

626
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,872
All right.

627
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,583
Is this it?

628
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,044
Yes.

629
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,185
Are you leaving now?

630
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,563
Yes.

631
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,612
I had

632
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,615
a lot of fun today.

633
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,290
When are you coming back?

634
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,753
I don't know.

635
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,297
I'm not sure yet.

636
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,934
This is an old building, so it's not warm.

637
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,145
It's a tiny room.

638
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,314
And I have only one blanket.

639
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,318
What?

640
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,989
Do you want to stay tonight?

641
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:13,828
Oh...

642
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,377
You don't want to?

643
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,806
I'm not rich yet.

644
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,570
Forget it.

645
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,469
Saeroyi.

646
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,143
Take care.

647
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,687
Stay healthy.

648
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:25,817
Okay.

649
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,069
You too.

650
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:40,915
Go on in.

651
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,526
-Kim Min-deok.
-Yes.

652
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,530
Park Hui-jun.

653
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,290
Park... What a unique name.

654
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,917
-Park Saeroyi.
-Yes.

655
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,215
-Yu Tae-hyeon.
-Yes.

656
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,699
7 YEARS LATER

657
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:02,664
JANGGA CO.

658
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,998
I want that jerk

659
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,210
to get screwed up.

660
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:15,385
What he's eating
looks even more delicious.

661
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,222
I'm sick of this guy.
I want to take her from him.

662
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,433
I don't care even if others get doomed.

663
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,687
I want to be the most successful one.

664
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,064
But

665
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,610
am I the only one who feels this way?
Am I the one who's bad?

666
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:37,699
The world is unfair.
Don't force me to be nice.

667
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,492
I can be

668
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,744
a bad person just for today.

669
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,832
Come on into Vicious Bar.

670
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,418
This is the concept.

671
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,627
Hang on.

672
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,258
Why would people want to go
to an unpleasant place like that?

673
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,308
Because

674
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,646
everyone is just

675
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,107
born evil.

676
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:12,817
What?

677
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,697
You know the Evil Nature Principle.

678
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,992
The theory that human nature
is fundamentally evil.

679
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:23,161
But if people stick to their instincts,

680
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,996
society will collapse.

681
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,582
That's why people repress themselves

682
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,877
with manners, consideration,
morals, and the law.

683
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,254
Repression?

684
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,132
It's stress.

685
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,054
What if Vicious Bar can
relieve your stress?

686
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,680
If that's possible,

687
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,224
it will be interesting.

688
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,478
This is just a draft.

689
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,230
Please just consider the basic theme.

690
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,066
Interesting.

691
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,902
Sure. It's interesting.

692
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,028
It's new.

693
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,780
Thank you.

694
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,406
Proceed with it.

695
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,742
Get back to me with the updated report.

696
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,954
Hey, Soo-ah.

697
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,586
What's up with you?

698
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,089
-What do you mean?
-You seem somewhat

699
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,257
cold to me.

700
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,927
Am I supposed to be warm?

701
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,224
Okay. What are you up to today?

702
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,266
I'm going to Itaewon.

703
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,060
For a meeting with the store manager.

704
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,229
That's good. You're going my way.

705
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,605
Can I give you a ride?

706
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,775
Hey. I need Soo-ah today.

707
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,443
Gosh, Min-jung.

708
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,570
Call me Ms. Kang at work.

709
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:43,449
Do you guys have a plan?
Am I interrupting you?

710
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,869
No way. Shall we go then?

711
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,164
Sorry.

712
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,380
You're in charge

713
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,590
of brand planning as the director
at your age.

714
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,217
It's reassuring to have you.

715
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,555
It's all thanks to your teaching.

716
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,433
I know. You have a good teacher, right?

717
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,851
Sure.

718
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,105
You're pretty and competent.

719
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,315
I liked you from the beginning.

720
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,652
What do you think?

721
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,613
Isn't it about time
to choose your connection?

722
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,744
I've still got a lot to learn here.

723
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,162
That's too much for me.

724
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,456
Gosh, did I just get dumped?

725
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,585
No. I just want to learn more
to help you better.

726
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,379
You sneaky vixen.

727
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,009
I just called you to ask
if you're interested in a blind date.

728
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,345
A blind date?

729
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,806
I don't think you've dated a guy
since you joined.

730
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,645
I'm flattered, but maybe next time.

731
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,357
I think I will be busy
with the upcoming project.

732
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:01,068
You live such an unexciting life.

733
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,528
Do you like work that much?

734
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,405
That's what I learned from you.

735
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,073
You're not supposed to learn that.

736
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,659
You'll be lonely in your later years.

737
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,965
I'm 29.

738
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,435
I haven't seen Saeroyi since that day.

739
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:38,856
Seven years was a long time.

740
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,861
And about when my memories
about Saeroyi started to fade...

741
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,208
I guess this store is sold.

742
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,341
Soo-ah.

743
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,214
You haven't changed.

744
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,927
Saeroyi?

745
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,353
When will you start?

746
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,688
In seven years.

747
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:08,070
It's been exactly seven years.

748
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,198
A store in Itaewon

749
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,743
with the average premium
of over 200 million won.

750
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,119
DANBAM

751
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,998
The 22-year-old guy's plan
that sounded rather absurd.

752
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,086
But Saeroyi

753
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,633
made it happen.

754
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,518
Have you been doing well?

755
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,773
To him,

756
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:49,862
it is

757
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,406
only natural.

758
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,928
I CAN BEAT HIM

759
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,894
Who is Jo Yi-seo?

760
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,646
You crazy bitch.

761
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,567
-Counter.
-Jo Yi-seo.

762
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,695
A genius girl with an IQ of 162.

763
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,531
And Yi-seo is a sociopath.

764
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,241
That's crazy.

765
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,245
How nosy.

766
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,538
We have customers.

767
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:44,625
Apparently Park Saeroyi
opened a store in Itaewon.

768
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,627
Whom would you choose?

769
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,547
Poor Saeroyi who ruined his life
because of me.

770
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,632
I have a 15-year plan.

771
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,468
Wait for me.

772
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,391
