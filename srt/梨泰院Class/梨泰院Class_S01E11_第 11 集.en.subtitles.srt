PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 11

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,105
The Best Pub?

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,944
The business is doing pretty well
these days,

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,863
so I'm not sure if there's a point.

8
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,947
Let me talk to them.

9
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,284
Yes, so...

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,496
We don't have to pay
to be on the show, right?

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,164
Okay.

12
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:25,460
Then I'll discuss with my staff
and get back to you.

13
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,753
All right.

14
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,589
The Best Pub?

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,466
They want us back on the show?

16
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,178
Goodness. They refused to put us on,
but now they want us back?

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,014
We generated quite the buzz
thanks to Jangga Co.

18
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,517
A victim of a company's power abuse
overcame hardship

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,769
-and opened his own business.
-Hey.

20
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,857
What? It's an inspiring story.

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,236
And everyone loves
success stories like this.

22
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,824
We've received a number of inquiries
regarding using the name, DanBam.

23
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,618
When is Hyun-yi coming back?

24
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,911
In a week.

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,956
Then it'll work out, time-wise.

26
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,251
What do you guys all think
about going on the show?

27
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,213
Well, I have no reason to object to it.

28
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,381
I'm on board.

29
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,599
Me too.
I think it'll be beneficial for DanBam.

30
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,939
Then...

31
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,440
Also,

32
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,777
I have something to tell you.

33
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,405
Okay, what is it?

34
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:38,950
I will

35
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,411
leave DanBam.

36
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,544
Hey, what the heck are you talking about?

37
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,883
I've been thinking about it for a while--

38
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,676
Let's go upstairs and have a chat.

39
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,939
I'm curious.

40
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,153
You've been holding out well
even though you don't really belong here.

41
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,323
Why do you want to quit now?

42
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,496
Because of you.

43
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,770
I've mentioned this before,
but if it's because of your family--

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,812
No, it's not.

45
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,524
That's not the reason.

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,194
Then what is it?

47
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm not sure if you know this,

48
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,201
but I was born out of wedlock.

49
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,827
What about it?

50
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,665
There are things I always used to hear

51
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,167
because of it.

52
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,086
"Don't be greedy.

53
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,005
Know your place.

54
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,132
Mooch off the Jangga Co."

55
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,302
So I kept that in mind

56
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,722
and never wanted anything in life.

57
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,063
That's how I used to live,

58
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,149
but you're...

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
Your "way of life," shall I say?

60
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,701
It was very stimulating.

61
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,664
I must've learned something here.

62
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,333
I think I've changed a little.

63
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,128
No.

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,423
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,719
you should take over Jangga Co.

66
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,725
I'm going to change.

67
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,279
I'm not sure what the reason is,
but I can't ask you to stay.

68
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,452
All the best.

69
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,001
I'll do my best.

70
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,394
Look who's here.

71
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,188
What's up, Soo-ah?

72
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,987
Are you all right?

73
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,533
I won't be here long anyway.

74
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,495
I'll get out soon. Don't worry.

75
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,709
Thanks for visiting me.
This makes me feel better.

76
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,045
I appreciate it.

77
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,132
The chairman

78
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,802
sent me here.

79
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,391
My dad?

80
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,603
He's doing well, right?

81
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,356
Right, I'm the sole heir of the company.

82
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,733
He can't be at ease,
knowing that I'm here.

83
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,070
Tell him not to worry

84
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,281
and that I'm doing well here.

85
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,960
JANGGA CO.

86
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,011
It's an agreement

87
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,931
for share transfer.

88
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,017
What?

89
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,188
The chairmanÂ wants you

90
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,234
to transfer your shares

91
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,613
to himself.

92
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,191
I heard that all went well
with the share transfer.

93
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,402
Good.

94
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,613
Dad.

95
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,078
You...

96
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,414
What are you doing here?

97
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,256
I think I should start learning

98
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,467
about management.

99
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,679
-What?
-I'm talking about Jangga Co.

100
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,474
I should

101
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
run the company down the road.

102
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,152
-What are you--
-You dedicated your life to Jangga Co.

103
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,034
Can you really leave it in the hands
of a complete stranger?

104
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,916
You don't have an alternative.

105
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,553
CHOI SEUNG-KWON

106
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,471
That was too heartless.

107
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,140
Shouldn't we have had
a goodbye party for him?

108
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,561
I know. I feel like it was too rushed.

109
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,229
With Geun-soo gone,

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,690
this place feels empty.

111
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,400
Why did he quit?

112
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,736
What do you think?
It's obviously because of someone we know.

113
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
Hello, welcome to--

114
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,415
What?

115
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,293
Hold on.

116
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,297
Pretty lady, what's with all this makeup?

117
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,633
The surgery went well.

118
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,512
I'm back at work tomorrow, you know.
I'm stopping by to let you know

119
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,306
that I'm back safe.

120
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,391
You look pretty.

121
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,018
I know, right?

122
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,186
I can't believe
you look prettier than I do.

123
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,105
My gosh.

124
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,316
You totally surprised us.
Right, Seung-kwon?

125
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,859
Yes. What? What did you say?

126
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,324
You heard the news, right?

127
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,827
Yes. About Geun-soo
and The Best Pub, right?

128
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,787
A lot happened while I was gone.

129
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,333
Let's spend some time with Geun-soo soon.

130
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,127
What do you want to do?
About The Best Pub.

131
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,131
Why even ask?
It's a good opportunity for us.

132
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,592
We should do it.

133
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,262
I knew it. Great minds think alike.

134
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,853
JANGGA CO.

135
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,355
This is good enough.

136
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,525
You may stop managing the pub.

137
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,985
Pardon?

138
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,364
-Then--
-I don't need you in Itaewon anymore.

139
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,157
Focus on the planning team.

140
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,619
Yes, sir.

141
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,206
You know the TV show
Geun-won was in charge of.

142
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,751
The Best Pub, right?

143
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,294
You take charge of it.

144
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,131
And do me a favor.

145
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,092
What is it, sir?

146
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,512
Come in.

147
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,817
Hello. I'm Jang Geun-soo, Ms. Oh.

148
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,737
What brings you here?

149
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,198
You two met before, right?

150
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,077
He's my younger son.

151
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,746
I want you to train him.

152
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,669
I'm looking forward to working with you,
Ms. Oh.

153
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,049
Don't mind us.

154
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,676
This is your desk.

155
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,725
And this is the planning team's manual.

156
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,228
It's very thick.

157
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,064
You need to be multifaceted to work here.

158
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,191
It has the basic information.

159
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:15,985
Okay.

160
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,613
By the way,

161
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,534
why did you leave DanBam?

162
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,621
There's something I want.

163
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,582
I guess I've gotten greedy.

164
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,792
"Greedy"?

165
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,713
I have to stay in Jangga Co. to get it.

166
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,339
And that's why

167
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,844
I'll do my best, Ms. Oh.

168
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,644
Ma'am. Please, ma'am.

169
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,813
-That's for my son's school lunch.
-Let go!

170
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,482
Please give me a bit more time.

171
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,651
Please, I have to make sure
my son gets his lunch at least.

172
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,826
-Dad!
-Don't give me such bullshit.

173
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,496
Why have a child
if you can't even feed him?

174
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,749
Ma'am.

175
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,045
Ma'am!

176
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,172
Gosh.

177
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,843
What are you doing here?

178
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,106
I was fond of you, but you're mean.

179
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,902
What do you mean?

180
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,740
I was just collecting the money
I lent to him. You call that "mean"?

181
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,660
What about his son though?
What's he going to eat?

182
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,747
He can afford to drink
but doesn't have money to feed his son?

183
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,666
That's ridiculous.

184
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,918
Still.

185
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:58,963
Shut it.

186
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,051
One mussel soup for Table Eight.

187
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,559
Toni, can you season
the mussel soup for me?

188
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,727
Sure.

189
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,443
CURRY POWDER

190
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,992
-Hey, what about the bean sprouts?
-Hang on a second.

191
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,827
All right. It's ready.

192
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,330
By the way, why do I smell curry?
We don't have anything with curry.

193
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,423
-Toni.
-Yes?

194
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,884
Why did you put curry powder
in the mussel soup?

195
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,012
Why is it taking so long?
The orders--

196
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,645
What are you doing?

197
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,359
This actually isn't bad.

198
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,249
DANBAM PUB

199
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:22,296
On cold winter days, we crave
spicy kimchi stew accompanied by soju.

200
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,965
All year-round, even if it rains or snows,

201
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,842
pubs are there to console us.

202
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,220
Sixteen famous pubs
from all over the country

203
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,639
are here.

204
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,474
This is the first round.

205
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,311
Which pubs will survive?

206
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,980
What will the judges' choice be?

207
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,359
The search
for the best pub in the country.

208
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,236
The winner of the first round.

209
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,697
The winner is...

210
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,867
WHICH PUB WILL COME IN FIRST PLACE?

211
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,918
It's DanBam Pub's Ma Hyun-yi.
Congratulations.

212
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:08,592
Yes, Ma Hyun-yi! Ma Hyun-yi!

213
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,178
Ma Hyun-yi!

214
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,973
Ma Hyun-yi!

215
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,144
-Are you that excited?
-Gosh, I'm sorry!

216
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,229
Jeez, my ears...

217
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,356
JUDGES LOVED HER CURRY MUSSEL POT

218
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,108
How many times have we watched this?

219
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,360
You already know I won.
Don't make such a fuss.

220
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,445
You're number one in the country.

221
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,240
She's our head cook, you know.

222
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,450
This was to be expected.

223
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,202
Didn't you want to fire her?

224
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,122
Me? When? I never said that.

225
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,165
I can't live without you, Hyun-yi.

226
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,888
Hello, we're not open yet.
Could you come back at 5 p.m.?

227
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,809
I'm not here to eat. Is the owner around?

228
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,897
What a nice view.

229
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,110
We have to get ready for the opening.

230
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,279
My apologies.

231
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,826
I'm Do Jung-myeong,
the CEO of JM Holdings.

232
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,912
I'm interested in franchising DanBam.

233
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,917
Franchising our pub?

234
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:28,297
JM Holdings? And you're interested
in franchising our business?

235
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,591
Are you here with an investment offer?

236
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,967
That's correct.

237
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,012
I'm glad you came, sir.

238
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,016
How did you hear about us?

239
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:43,062
We're an investment firm, but we also have
a few stable subsidiaries.

240
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,855
An interior design firm, for example.

241
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,233
We were looking for a business
to partner with,

242
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,028
and I happened to watch the show,
The Best Pub, recently.

243
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,994
HYUN-YI OF DANBAM WINS

244
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,329
So the winner is DanBam.

245
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,666
Park Saeroyi's pub.

246
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,544
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

247
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,338
I suppose I overestimated you.

248
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,091
I'm sorry, sir.

249
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,515
This is a cooking competition show
in a tournament format.

250
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,433
They've passed the first round,

251
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,560
but that isn't that important.

252
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,687
Enough.

253
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,567
We came in second place, sir.

254
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,072
I guess you're happy

255
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,533
that we came in second.

256
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,703
I apologize, sir. I'll train him well.

257
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,540
I'll train my own son. You may leave.

258
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,430
Don't give me that stupid face.

259
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,017
I guess you can't gauge the situation.

260
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,689
I guess not.

261
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,235
We came in second
among all the famous pubs in the country.

262
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,238
What's the problem?

263
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,200
Because Saeroyi's pub won?

264
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,459
How would you describe Jangga Co.?

265
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,422
-What?
-The best in the foodservice industry.

266
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,216
But what?

267
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,386
It's a tournament,
and that was only the first round?

268
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,221
Coming in second is impressive enough?

269
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,646
We're always number one.
That's why we're called the best.

270
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,400
And you just ruined it.

271
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,324
I thought you were
determined to prove yourself,

272
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,576
but you're such a softie.

273
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,911
What?

274
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,165
You'll run the company?

275
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,667
You're the only alternative?

276
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,503
Nonsense.

277
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,505
"The best."

278
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,218
I even ousted my eldest son
to protect that image.

279
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,304
I wouldn't even hesitate
to desert a punk like you.

280
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,766
Get out.

281
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,153
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,621
I thought you were pretty smart.

283
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,627
You're a mere employee.

284
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,797
And you talked back to the chairman
in front of me?

285
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,174
Why are you so confident?

286
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,426
Kinship?

287
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,683
I know how you worked with Saeroyi,

288
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,436
but things are done differently here.

289
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,275
We are a strictly vertically structured.

290
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,360
I don't care even if you're his son.

291
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,655
I do not need an incompetent employee
on my team.

292
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,535
Get used to it quickly.

293
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,249
That's all good, but...

294
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,549
Things like "the family"
and "the chairman's son."

295
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,761
Please refrain
from using such expressions.

296
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,851
You don't know my relationship
to the family and what kind of life

297
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,228
I've lived.

298
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,775
Is that so?

299
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,699
But you see,

300
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,705
you didn't even go to college,
and don't qualify for this job.

301
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,500
So how did you get this job
without even going through an interview?

302
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,462
Because you're the chairman's son.

303
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,798
I have no interest in your story.

304
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:26,136
If you don't want to hear these things,
just do your job right.

305
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,361
Being on the show is doing us some good.

306
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,113
We're certainly getting more customers.

307
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,117
We're getting more franchise inquiries.
And now, even an investment offer.

308
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,995
I think now's the perfect time.

309
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,790
Let's streamline our branding.

310
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,875
I agree with you, Boss.

311
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,171
What? How do we do that?

312
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,757
-First, we'll--
-First off...

313
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,594
Ta-da. Have a look at this.

314
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,012
What is it?

315
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,848
A manual for our interior design,
recipes, and employees.

316
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,768
I put this together
while working on our reopening.

317
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,105
I took all the trials and errors
into consideration.

318
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,442
When did you do all of this?

319
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,278
I'm impressed.

320
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,537
We can open another location
right away with this.

321
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,625
-What?
-We've been receiving many inquiries.

322
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,627
We'll be opening locations, one by one.

323
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,421
We'll make it a success

324
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,006
-and participate in the Franchise Expo--
-Hang on.

325
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,717
But why do it in such a roundabout way?

326
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,262
There's a company
that wants to invest in us.

327
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,639
Oh, that company? Something Holdings?

328
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,729
It's too soon to attract investment
to start something.

329
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,273
In what way?

330
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,068
We only have one location. We don't have
experience in another location.

331
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,406
Boss, we managed to do so well
even in this remote alley.

332
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,199
What more experience do we need?

333
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,036
For the franchisees,
their livelihood depends on this.

334
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,788
Are you sure we'll never go bust?

335
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,167
What business is completely immune

336
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
to the risk of going bust?

337
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,047
All I'm saying is,
it's safer to open locations one by one

338
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,551
than to open multiple franchise locations
at once.

339
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,431
I understand.

340
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,767
But there's a company
that's willing to invest in us,

341
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,187
so we can take that money
and create a system

342
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,522
that can manage multiple locations.

343
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,316
If we open locations one by one,

344
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,068
when will we catch up with Jangga Co.?

345
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,583
Well, Yi-seo does have a point.

346
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,960
She always does.

347
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,129
Then what's the problem?

348
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,383
Nothing, really.
I just want to find the best solution.

349
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,472
-CEO Do Jung-myeong...
-Do you know him?

350
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,265
I've heard of his name.

351
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,018
This investment firm is quite well-known.

352
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,938
I'll look into this, just in case.

353
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,065
Oh, what about the other thing?

354
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,441
Right, just a second.

355
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,951
His name is Toni, right?

356
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,411
It's the visa application.
Three years would be fine.

357
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,829
Thanks.

358
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,415
I told you employing foreigners is hard.

359
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,125
All the paperwork is one thing,

360
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,169
but that. What a hassle.

361
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,796
You're doing it again?

362
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,882
It's not a hassle.
It doesn't even take long.

363
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,803
Anyway, find out more information
about JM Holdings. I'm off.

364
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
I can't get a hold of your boss.

365
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,645
I'm surprised
because I feel like I'm being clingy.

366
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,064
That's not true, sir.

367
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,733
My boss is very careful and cautious.

368
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,946
We're positively considering it,
so please give us a little more time.

369
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,365
Okay. All right, then.

370
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,618
But we need to come up with a plan,
so we can't keep on waiting.

371
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,454
We'll visit you soon.

372
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,123
I'm sorry, sir.

373
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,424
Damn it.

374
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,011
-What?
-Where's our boss?

375
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:44,311
LOOKING FOR KIM TONI'S FATHER,
KIM DONG-GIL

376
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,693
I want pupa soup and a bowl of rice.

377
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,613
Ma'am, how many times
do I have to tell you?

378
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,740
You can't order just the side items.

379
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,158
Why are you saying I can't?

380
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,160
Saeroyi told me it's fine.

381
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,246
There he is.

382
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,374
I'd like pupa soup and a bowl of rice.

383
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,626
Sure.

384
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,214
-Hey, Toni.
-Boss, you're back.

385
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,761
Take this. It's the visa application.

386
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,512
You can stay for three years.

387
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,098
Boss.

388
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,227
Thank you.

389
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,608
Can you put this back?

390
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,203
I'm so relieved now.

391
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:48,500
You need to do all this just to stay?
It's stressful being a foreigner.

392
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,669
I told you that I'm Korean.

393
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,295
I know, you fool.

394
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,631
Where are you from?

395
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,759
I'm from Guinea. It's a country in Africa.

396
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,719
Guinea?

397
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,310
Hello.

398
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,520
Hello.

399
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,901
DANBAM

400
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,577
Did you put these up?

401
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,121
Yes.

402
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,081
Someone reported it to us.

403
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,958
It's illegal to put up flyers.

404
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,503
You're fined 100,000 won.

405
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,923
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

406
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,968
I feel bad for the guy looking
for his dad, but don't put this up.

407
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,678
Okay.

408
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,479
Boss, how long have you been
distributing these?

409
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,732
For about a month.

410
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,109
Sorry, it wasn't helpful.

411
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,194
No, you've done enough.

412
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,488
Thank you.

413
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,783
Don't worry. We'll look for him together.

414
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,329
-Boss.
-Yes?

415
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,497
Let's talk.

416
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,082
Okay.

417
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,961
Jeez, there she goes again.

418
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,838
Hey, just ignore her.

419
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,091
Ma'am?

420
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,178
Ma'am.

421
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,534
What did your friend say?

422
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,207
He said it's a renowned investment firm.

423
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,211
I asked Ho-jin to look into it,

424
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,756
and I want to think about it.

425
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,924
Then what?

426
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,010
It's not like we can stop the bus
once it leaves.

427
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,680
Mr. Do called earlier.

428
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,766
He can't wait indefinitely.

429
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,230
It's great that you're trying

430
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,982
to help Toni find his dad
and to look after everyone else.

431
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,070
But the timing is important,
and there's a thing called priority.

432
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,239
Am I the only one who's anxious?

433
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,908
Why must you make me so antsy?

434
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,082
I'm always the heartless bitch, aren't I?

435
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,708
-Yi-seo.
-Of course, I understand

436
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,335
you're the one who makes the call.

437
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,379
I'll follow your decision.

438
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,798
But can't you

439
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,510
trust me?

440
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,773
Are you confident?

441
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,693
What?

442
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,241
Yes.

443
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,035
Okay then. Let's do it.

444
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,248
That's great.

445
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,960
But why the sudden change?

446
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,379
Because I trust you the most.

447
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,053
You're not mean and coldhearted.

448
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,015
I'm just a stupid boss.

449
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,602
I'm sorry

450
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,104
for making you the bad guy.

451
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,320
Schedule a meeting with JM Holdings.

452
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,197
Okay, Boss.

453
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,840
First of all,
you need to set the value of your pub.

454
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,342
You need to decide on the value

455
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,094
if you don't want to get swayed by others.

456
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,558
I want to know why you chose DanBam.

457
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,313
You want to know why?

458
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,816
I got interested and looked into your pub.

459
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,152
You have quite a connection
with Jangga Co.

460
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,197
I had the chance to eat
with Chairman Jang a few times

461
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,407
when my father used to do politics,

462
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,701
so I also know him a little.

463
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,412
And I also know what happened
between you two

464
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,581
due to the recent incident.

465
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,293
He even kicked you out of the place
where you first opened your pub.

466
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,881
A small but sturdy brand

467
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,717
that the top food company
thinks of it as a competitor.

468
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,595
You managed to come this far
from scratch.

469
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,723
And you also have
a competent and trendy manager.

470
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,936
Your brand is surely worth the investment.

471
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,440
Is that not enough?

472
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,153
It's enough. Thank you for the compliment.

473
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,948
I would like to know

474
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,284
exactly how much
you think our brand is worth.

475
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,579
You mean the investment?

476
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,791
-I'll invest--
-Five billion won.

477
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,755
I think five billion won will be enough.

478
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,510
Boss.

479
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,058
That's how much we think DanBam is worth.

480
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,494
IS DANBAM RECEIVING FIVE BILLION WON?

481
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,332
I can't believe

482
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,627
he asked for this much.

483
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,216
He's one of a kind.

484
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,387
Hello, this is DanBam.

485
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,183
Yes. An investment? Just a second.

486
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,186
Hello, I'm Jo Yi-seo,
the manager of DanBam.

487
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,022
We still need to check a few things.

488
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,400
-So we can't give you...
-Our boss will call you back.

489
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,569
Okay, bye.

490
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,075
Hello, this is DanBam.

491
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,243
-What is going on?
-Yes.

492
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,455
-Yes.
-We'll have to check...

493
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,751
JM Holdings became your lead investor.

494
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,837
"Lead investor"?

495
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,049
A famous investor
invested five billion won.

496
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:57,303
And that caused others
to trust your brand and do the same.

497
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,938
If we add all this together,
we'll have over ten billion won.

498
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,232
Ten billion won.

499
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,193
You got really lucky.

500
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,404
I told you that we've got what it takes.

501
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,282
Let's make this worth it.

502
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,618
Okay.

503
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,171
He invested five billion won in DanBam?

504
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,090
Yes, sir.

505
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:38,302
There are also other investors,
and they got over ten billion won.

506
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,222
They rented an office
to turn the business into a brand.

507
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,809
Twenty people signed up to open the pub,
and over 50 people are waiting--

508
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,726
That's enough.

509
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,858
-Soft tofu stew.
-Here?

510
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,324
We need to know the trend
of the alcohol market.

511
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,576
People are starting to drink alone...

512
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,954
Our signature menus are soft tofu stew
and stir-fried pork belly.

513
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,414
Go ahead and try some.

514
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,375
Okay, everyone. Cheers to IC.

515
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,294
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

516
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,628
Ma'am.

517
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,714
I'm not a ghost. Why are you so startled?

518
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
Ma'am.

519
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,426
Look at you.

520
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,929
You're drinking again?
You can't even feed your son.

521
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,932
-My goodness gracious.
-No, wait. The thing is...

522
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,813
Are you kidding me?

523
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,025
-Are you serious? How could you?
-Give it back.

524
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,153
You're going to die
without even paying me back?

525
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,656
You useless punk!

526
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,034
What do I do then?
I can't even afford food for my son.

527
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,870
Do you think
he'll be able to eat if you die?

528
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,957
You should get a job.
How can you call yourself a dad?

529
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,460
You're just going to die
and forget about everything?

530
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,088
-You reckless punk!
-Stop it!

531
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,009
Ma'am!

532
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,807
Five billion? Ten billion?

533
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,767
It's so unreal!

534
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,269
What did I tell you guys?

535
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,604
If Saeroyi says we can do it,
then we can do it!

536
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,398
And I told you

537
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,567
that it's all thanks to you guys.

538
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,903
Look.

539
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,614
Ma'am.

540
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,492
Ma'am!

541
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,078
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

542
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,625
You don't need to worry.
She just needs some rest.

543
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,835
Thank you.

544
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,883
I'm sorry.

545
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,635
Go die.

546
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,179
-Go kill yourself.
-Ma'am.

547
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,183
Stop it.

548
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,107
I'm such a useless father.
I thought he'd be better off without me.

549
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,694
You're unbelievable.

550
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,783
If you have the guts to die,
you should try your best to stay alive.

551
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,577
Don't say it like it's nothing.

552
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,455
Do you know how it feels
to see your child starve?

553
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,165
You don't even have a family.

554
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,000
Are you kidding me?

555
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,086
-How dare you yell at me?
-Ma'am, calm down.

556
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,341
Sir.

557
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,804
I'd rather have a dad

558
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,931
than a full stomach.

559
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,354
Your son will be sad.

560
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,067
Whenever you're gone,

561
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,612
he always thinks of you

562
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,031
and misses you.

563
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,172
-Here.
-What?

564
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,090
Take it.

565
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,968
I'll buy this from you.

566
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,306
I'll use this to grill some meat at home.

567
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,059
Get going.

568
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,895
Didn't you hear him? Your son is waiting.

569
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,065
Ma'am.

570
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,786
Goodbye, sir.

571
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,084
Your family must be worried.

572
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,586
Shouldn't you call them?

573
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,464
I also once

574
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,008
had a family.

575
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,223
He lived his entire life

576
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,936
doing what I always asked him to do.

577
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,483
He was a kind son.

578
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,699
But one day, he suddenly told me
that he married a black woman.

579
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,290
She was from Africa.

580
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,628
She was Guinean.

581
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,091
But I disapproved.

582
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,137
-Then by any chance--
-Ma'am.

583
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,431
Here.

584
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,558
Take a look at this.

585
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,782
For the first time in his life,

586
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,451
he told me what he wanted.

587
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,790
But I disapproved of it.

588
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,879
He must've hated me so much.

589
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,509
Where is your son?

590
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,057
He died.

591
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,520
Due to a car accident.

592
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,869
I'm sorry, my baby.

593
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,351
I really don't know what to say.

594
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,812
At least he found his grandmother.

595
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,523
He'll finally be able
to get his citizenship.

596
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,402
My gosh, she has no compassion.

597
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,406
Is Toni going to keep working with us?

598
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,160
We'll let him decide.

599
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,621
Let's just focus on the contest for now.

600
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,960
Okay, I got it.

601
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,507
It'd be stew or soup.
Without artificial seasoning.

602
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,051
No artificial seasoning?

603
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,013
How about cheonggukjang?

604
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:01,930
Cheonggukjang?

605
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,976
I'm the best
when it comes to cheonggukjang.

606
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,895
You know how good I am.

607
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,898
How did you find out the mission?

608
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,944
Well, let's just say
I have some connections.

609
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,488
That's amazing.

610
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,115
Everyone knows that she's amazing.

611
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,410
Geun-soo, you should learn from her.

612
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,996
Cheonggukjang.

613
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,382
That's too thick.
That's not how you do it.

614
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,093
Try to keep it thin.

615
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,723
I learned at the pub.
But I still can't get it right.

616
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,019
Don't you hate me?

617
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,651
Why did you come here to see me?

618
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,113
Dad told me a lot about you.

619
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,577
"We were poor.

620
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,706
But thanks to her, we never knew that.

621
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,709
Your grandmother starved.

622
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,044
But I was always full.

623
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,965
And I learned how incredible that was

624
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,218
after you were born."

625
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,727
Dad didn't hate you.

626
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,480
The reason he came back to Korea

627
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,443
was because he wanted to thank you.

628
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,160
Let me tell you on his behalf.

629
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,372
Grandma.

630
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,042
Thank you.

631
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,308
Grandma.

632
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,144
Thank you.

633
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,417
Come in.

634
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:36,919
Hyun-yi.

635
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,923
Look who's here.

636
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,092
It's Geun-soo who just left
without telling me.

637
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,636
I'm sorry.

638
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,889
I was going to call,
but I've been really busy.

639
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,850
Where are Saeroyi and Yi-seo?

640
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,519
They went to meet the producer.

641
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,813
Have you been well?

642
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,774
Yes. What about you?

643
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,109
I was really startled
when I saw you on TV.

644
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,570
Oh, right.

645
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,364
It's awkward, isn't it?

646
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,533
No.

647
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,909
You look gorgeous.

648
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,203
It suits you.

649
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,080
Thanks.

650
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,837
Today's mission is also very challenging.

651
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,463
They need to make stew or soup

652
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,049
without using any sugar, salt,
or other seasonings.

653
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,970
Most of the chefs are cooking
stew right now.

654
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,307
Kimchi stew, fish cake soup,
and doenjang stew.

655
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,561
I'm starting to crave soju
just by smelling all this food.

656
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,814
And let's take a look
at last week's number one.

657
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,149
Ma Hyun-yi from DanBam Pub.

658
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,819
Can you tell us what you're cooking?

659
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,655
Yes, I'm cooking soft tofu stew,
our pub's signature menu.

660
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,156
That's really new.

661
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,950
Soft tofu stew is the signature menu?

662
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,620
Yes, our boss loves this menu.

663
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,582
But you're kind of in the way.

664
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,251
Oh, okay. She's very cold.

665
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,753
People call her the Coldhearted Witch.

666
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,590
DanBam's soft tofu stew.

667
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,050
And Jangga Co.'s cheonggukjang.

668
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,844
You've had both, right?

669
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,138
Yes, they're both good.

670
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
It'll depend on the judges' preference.

671
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,519
Who do you think will win?

672
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:23,901
Jangga Co.

673
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,696
will lose.

674
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,580
DANBAM PUB

675
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,040
-Let's give it a taste.
-Okay.

676
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,089
The competition has come to an end.

677
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,549
The Best Pub.

678
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,843
Among the eight teams,

679
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,055
which team do you think will be

680
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,266
the winner of the second round?

681
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,562
The winner of the second round

682
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,274
is right here in my hand.

683
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,030
Unbelievable.

684
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,699
It's Ma Hyun-yi from DanBam Pub!
Congratulations!

685
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,706
WINNER OF QUARTERFINALS
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM

686
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,933
My mom used to tell me
that she hates black bean noodles

687
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,312
Why are you all so down?

688
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,857
It's nothing.

689
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,818
You did great, Mr. Park.

690
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,861
You too, Ms. Oh.

691
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:51,905
And you too, Geun-soo.

692
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,246
Ms. Oh deserves most of the credit.

693
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:04,292
She'll probably get scolded
by the chairman again.

694
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,214
You became popular
after the last episode, right?

695
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,591
You even held autograph sessions.

696
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,427
What?

697
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,471
You could've spent time
preparing for the second round.

698
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,389
Hey.

699
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,266
Are you trying to tell me

700
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,978
that I'm not doing my best
because I held a few autograph sessions?

701
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,690
Of course not.

702
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,984
He doesn't know what he's saying.

703
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,738
Hey, do you think it's easy
to come in second place?

704
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,992
We're always number one.
That's why we're called the best.

705
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,745
I know, right?

706
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,873
That's what I thought,

707
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,793
but I heard we can't be
like that at Jangga Co.

708
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,254
My father, I mean...

709
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,507
The chairman told me.

710
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,219
"Jangga Co.

711
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,057
has always been at its peak

712
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,560
If you want to settle for second place,

713
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,481
you don't deserve to be in Jangga Co."

714
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,738
I'm just worried about you.

715
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,909
Thank you for being so concerned.

716
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:34,049
I was being impertinent again. I'm sorry.

717
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,302
Don't be. You weren't wrong about that.

718
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,888
I thought Mr. Park was being too carefree.

719
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:41,848
Well done.

720
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,185
Soo-ah.

721
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,646
How are you, Geun-soo?

722
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,440
Good to see you here.

723
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,985
I read articles about your investments.
Congratulations.

724
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:54,945
Thanks.

725
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,155
You look great in a suit.

726
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,366
Thank you.

727
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,159
Do I look good?

728
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
So so.

729
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,705
Congratulations on winning first place.

730
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,833
Congrats on second place.

731
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,752
How does it feel to keep winning?

732
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,842
We have a team dinner.
Wanna join us? The guys will be there.

733
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,718
Forget it, Boss.

734
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,762
We don't need someone who already quit.

735
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,223
What do you want?

736
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,518
I want to go.

737
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,689
So the winner is paying.

738
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,358
Well... Sure.

739
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,413
Why aren't you doing anything?

740
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,374
Meddling in now won't help.

741
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,460
Everything is all about timing, Geun-soo.

742
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,381
Just wait for another two years.
You'll see how it ends.

743
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,093
What about Jangga Co.?

744
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,096
Is everything good
as you joined it through nepotism?

745
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,558
I'm still trying to adjust.

746
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,144
I see. We should stay in close contact.

747
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,896
Let me in on some trade secrets.

748
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,192
Have you been doing well?

749
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,070
What? It hasn't even been long
since you quit.

750
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,281
I know.

751
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,867
It hasn't been long,

752
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,369
but I miss it already.

753
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,414
But you seemed quite cool when you quit.

754
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,415
I told you.

755
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,626
It was because of you.

756
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,381
Aren't you coming?

757
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm coming.

758
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,103
Let's keep on going.

759
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,772
-Congratulations.
-Well done.

760
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,106
Cheers.

761
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,738
Hyun-yi, you looked so cool today.

762
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,865
I almost fell for you.

763
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,368
What? Have you not fallen for me yet?

764
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,370
Gosh, it's my mistake.

765
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,996
I've fallen for you long ago.

766
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,165
That's absurd.

767
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,334
What's wrong with him now?

768
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:19,965
What?

769
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,511
Hyun-yi, congratulations.

770
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,389
Go easy on us.

771
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:28,682
You're being matchless.

772
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,392
I know. I've been lucky.

773
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,560
Fill your glasses. Let's toast.

774
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,482
All right.

775
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,157
-Jo Yi-seo, it's you.
-Gosh.

776
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,993
I said I didn't want to do this.

777
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,911
Who would play Truth or Dare these days?

778
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,705
Why? It's fun.

779
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,419
What about you, Saeroyi?
Do you have any questions for Yi-seo?

780
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:00,964
Well...

781
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,136
If there's anything you want to know,
you can ask me.

782
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,935
Not really. I know everything about her.

783
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,817
Let me ask her then.

784
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:26,323
Hey, this isn't fun.
Let's just get this over with.

785
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,409
You said you'd come to me

786
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,995
once I take over Jangga Co.

787
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,209
Do you remember?

788
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,755
Yes.

789
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,507
I remember that, but it's just--

790
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,967
Okay. I'm done.

791
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,221
-I'm glad you remember it.
-Hey.

792
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,265
Is there something going on
between you two?

793
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,641
Gosh, hell no.

794
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,728
That's not true. Boss, it's not like that.

795
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,314
What? Okay.

796
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,192
You're so disrespectful to me.

797
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,527
Any more questions?

798
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,405
-It's not fun. Let's move on.
-Let me spin it.

799
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,913
-All right, Boss.
-It's you, Boss.

800
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,542
Do you have any questions for me?

801
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,711
Of course, we do.
Let me ask you something.

802
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:25,715
Your first kiss.

803
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,592
When was your first kiss?

804
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,730
-I don't have one.
-What do you mean?

805
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,649
You don't?

806
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,026
No way. That's ridiculous.

807
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,195
I've never kissed.

808
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,615
You've never kissed a woman before
at your age?

809
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,257
Is it sad?

810
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,845
I mean...

811
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,097
Well... I have a question.

812
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,056
What?

813
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,309
Between you and Soo-ah.

814
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,645
What's going on?

815
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,272
Are you guys just friends?

816
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,405
It's just...

817
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,702
I like Soo-ah.

818
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,372
Seriously?

819
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,207
What?

820
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,547
Can't you see what's going on?

821
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,923
Why did you pinch me?

822
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,633
Congratulations.

823
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,184
It's my turn.

824
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,562
Why do you guys have so many questions?

825
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,648
Did you ever

826
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,736
have feelings for Yi-seo?

827
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,076
You son of a...

828
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:35,803
No.

829
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,389
Not even once.

830
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,191
She's my friend and partner.

831
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,947
What kind of question is that?

832
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,616
Isn't it obvious?
You should take a shot.

833
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,247
Well...

834
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,917
I knew it though.

835
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,840
I already knew it, but...

836
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,718
Are you guys done?

837
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,179
Yes. Well done, Hyun-yi.

838
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,475
What?

839
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,648
Yi-seo.

840
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,066
Yes?

841
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,195
Are you crying?

842
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,786
What's wrong with me?

843
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,789
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

844
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:48,751
What's wrong?

845
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,674
What are you waiting for?

846
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,553
-What?
-Can't you see? She's hurt.

847
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,222
Go bring her.

848
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,642
She's hurt?

849
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,811
Then he shouldn't go after her.

850
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,610
You have no feelings for her.

851
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,406
If you go, you're giving her false hope.

852
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:22,410
You don't have to be so firm
to hurt her feelings.

853
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,748
You said she means a lot.

854
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,459
Don't let her cry alone.

855
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:39,844
I'll be right back.

856
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,932
What is going on?

857
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,646
Does Yi-seo like him?

858
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,564
Why are you being like this?

859
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:54,859
Me?

860
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,278
Why?

861
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,948
What you just did.

862
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,242
It was obnoxious.

863
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,425
Yi-seo.

864
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,553
Stop there.

865
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,062
Why are you being like this?

866
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,021
Let go of me.

867
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,568
It's cold.

868
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,154
-Let's go in.
-Get off me.

869
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,241
You said you have no feelings for me.

870
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,660
What's wrong with you?

871
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,663
You're a smart girl.
Why are you acting like a kid?

872
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,000
I had a plan for two years.

873
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,754
But Geun-soo ruined the whole thing.

874
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,216
What?

875
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:03,928
If that's the case,

876
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,724
I'm going for plan B.

877
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:16,816
I should

878
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,861
tell him now.

879
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:25,825
I feel like

880
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,828
my heart will burst out of my chest.

881
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,917
-Are you okay?
-I love you.

882
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,428
I love you.

883
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,184
I love you, Boss.

884
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,313
I love you.

885
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,025
I really love you.

886
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,082
It's just...

887
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,920
You're mistaken

888
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,339
because we're like a family and--

889
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,174
I'm not mistaken.

890
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,721
I've never thought of you as a family.

891
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,898
From the moment we first met
until now,

892
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,194
I couldn't be more sure about my feelings.

893
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,751
I heard Geun-soo likes you.

894
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,422
You said you'd go out with him
if he does well.

895
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,801
-That's how we're supposed--
-Why are you talking about Geun-soo?

896
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,305
I just

897
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,475
said that the other day,
but I didn't mean it.

898
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,978
I just said such a thing

899
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,981
to take advantage of his feelings
to help you.

900
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,441
What's that?

901
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,736
Do you not care about his feelings?

902
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,614
How could you mess
with someone's feelings?

903
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,532
I know

904
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,243
that it's not ethical.

905
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,163
I don't expect you to understand me.

906
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,002
I just don't want to lie to you.

907
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,545
This is me.

908
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,256
But

909
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,634
since I know you hate things like this...

910
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,219
Now that I know it,

911
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,013
I won't be like that anymore.

912
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,432
So

913
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,976
stop talking about Geun-soo

914
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,146
and see me for what I really am.

915
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,029
Yi-seo.

916
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,490
I'm ten years older than you.

917
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,373
Things have been good for us so far.

918
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,461
-I have a lot of things to do--
-Stop it.

919
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,881
If you don't like me,

920
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,467
that's just what it is.

921
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,057
Work, age gap, and all that.

922
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,559
They are just excuses.

923
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,815
That's the last thing
I want to hear from you.

924
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,533
All you need

925
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,370
is one word.

926
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,625
Is it

927
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,586
never going to happen?

928
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,190
No.

929
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,027
Don't like me.

930
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,408
My life

931
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,619
is a little

932
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:03,954
bitter.

933
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,290
I want

934
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,918
my bitter night

935
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,173
to be a bit sweeter.

936
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:46,747
I have you.

937
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,255
That just consoled me

938
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,841
more than anything.

939
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,365
It's the final, right?

940
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,409
I have a high card
that I don't want to use.

941
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,161
Is this the card you talked about?

942
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,580
I told you. You can do this.
Good luck, Ma Hyun-yi.

943
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,582
Look how we ended up after trusting her.

944
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:13,459
You all signed after you came here.

945
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,085
You signed after tasting our food!

946
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,712
All the staff are struggling,

947
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,547
but you only care about your pride.

948
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,466
Forget the whole thing and come to me.

949
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,303
And the harder he tries,
the harder he'll fall and collapse.

950
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,014
I'm burning with anger.
