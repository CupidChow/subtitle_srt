PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3

EPISODE 10

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,522
Enough.

5
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
What?

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,945
I want you to stop now.

7
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,532
Stop what?

8
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,080
RECORDING

9
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,456
Let me see.

10
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,210
Was it around here?

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,675
The law is
all about disciplining the poor.

12
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,804
The law doesn't apply to those who rule.

13
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,516
So? Would you please
tell me about it in detail?

14
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:41,935
It's nothing.

15
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,394
It was an accident.

16
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,689
I hit his dad with a car,

17
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,192
and he died instantly.

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,821
But someone else ended up in jail.
End of the story.

19
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,033
What are you doing?

20
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,621
I've never seen

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,833
a dumbhead like you my whole life.

22
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,334
Damn it.

23
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,052
You see,

24
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,014
I love my boss like crazy.

25
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,602
But the problem is

26
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:31,651
that his head is full of the bastards
from that damn Jangga Co.

27
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,490
I'm so jealous.

28
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,914
You damn sons of bitches.

29
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,429
So

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,641
I'm going to crush you all.

31
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,277
Yi-seo.

32
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,945
Jo Yi-seo!

33
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,495
Hey, stop right there!

34
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,880
I...

35
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,757
clearly told you to stop.

36
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,553
You're guilty of covering up a murder
and now even assault.

37
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,182
Give me your phone.

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,559
You'd better before I kill you.

39
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,687
I said, give me your phone!

40
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,441
You know what? We're in Itaewon now.

41
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,028
Help!

42
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:13,461
This area is filled with gentlemen
from all over the world.

43
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,800
You're enjoying this.

44
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:24,264
You see, people aren't fans
of uncertain situations.

45
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,642
And if there's one thing
that always works...

46
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,894
Watch, okay?

47
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,155
You son of a bitch.

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,535
Get it?

49
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,871
In Itaewon,
or anywhere else for that matter,

50
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,832
money solves all problems--

51
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,714
Boss?

52
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,217
What's going on?

53
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,970
Why are you on the ground? Get up.

54
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,058
Boss, I recorded everything.

55
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,895
I recorded that bastard confessing
the murder of your father.

56
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,649
If we use this and involve the media,
the police may reinvestigate the case.

57
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,864
What happened to your face?

58
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,418
Was it you? Did you do that to her face?

59
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,670
Yes.

60
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,047
What about it?

61
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,133
You want to punch me? Go ahead.

62
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,010
Punch me all you want.

63
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,387
And get locked up again
for attempted murder.

64
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,680
-You crazy--
-Boss.

65
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,020
Don't be such a bluffer.
Go ahead and punch me.

66
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,980
Boss.

67
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,066
Don't.

68
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,501
Shit.

69
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,840
-Where are you going?
-Fuck, step aside.

70
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,718
-Move. I said, step aside.
-Jeez!

71
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,478
Damn it.

72
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,834
Just let it go.

73
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,919
It's all over now...

74
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,467
It's over.

75
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,558
Are you okay?

76
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,687
Yes, I'm fine.
These things don't hurt at all.

77
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,524
I saw you worrying about me
and getting angry for me. That's enough.

78
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,077
Sorry.

79
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,331
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,568
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOSS TEN YEARS AGO

81
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,946
Last night,
an assault was reported in Itaewon.

82
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,491
It has been confirmed that the assailant
was Mr. Jang Geun-won,

83
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,367
the son of Jangga's chairman,
Mr. Jang Dae-hee,

84
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,203
who's been accused
of power abuse in the past.

85
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,954
This assault case

86
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,332
is taking a toll on public sentiment
toward the company.

87
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,418
According to the assault victim, Ms. Jo,

88
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,378
Mr. Jang lost his temper
because she recorded

89
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,006
his confession about a hit-and-run
which he caused in the past.

90
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,467
He couldn't control his anger
during their argument

91
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,011
and brutally assaulted the victim.

92
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,766
You idiot!

93
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,603
I'm sorry.

94
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,234
I told you to bring her on board.

95
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
Why hit her?

96
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,492
I'm really sorry.

97
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,537
You moron.

98
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,040
And what?

99
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,417
You confessed to the hit-and-run?

100
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,178
Get out.

101
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,473
You don't even deserve a beating.

102
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,755
God damn it!

103
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,435
What are you doing here alone?

104
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,481
Min-jung.

105
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,570
I can't believe your father hit you.

106
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,904
Let me take a look.

107
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,282
Are you okay?

108
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,410
I deserved it.

109
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,662
Min-jung, I'm sorry for...

110
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,497
I mean...

111
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,710
Ms. Kang, I'm sorry for causing a mess.

112
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,004
What you did was wrong,

113
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,714
but what's done is done.

114
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,259
You shouldn't look so dejected
as the future head of the company.

115
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,595
Keep your chin up.

116
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,806
The company will do everything

117
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,892
to take care of it.

118
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,238
Thank you.

119
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,452
You must

120
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,871
dismiss Geun-won.

121
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,167
The accident that killed Mr. Park
ten years ago

122
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,836
and the stuff you did to cover that up.

123
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,757
If people find out what happened,
you'll get involved in that mess.

124
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,219
And if that happens,

125
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,930
it'll no longer be a family issue.

126
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,646
How do you know

127
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,732
about what happened back then?

128
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,534
That kid, Yi-seo,
uploaded what she recorded.

129
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,995
Geun-won had just graduated high school.

130
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,124
He couldn't have dealt with it alone.

131
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,672
Is it the company or your son?

132
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,551
You need to choose.

133
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,704
Seung-kwon, I'll clean the bathroom.

134
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,039
Here. Gosh, what's this?

135
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,583
Go ahead.

136
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,593
Boss.

137
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,222
I knew something happened
between you and Geun-soo's family.

138
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,683
But this is a lot more serious
than what I had imagined.

139
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,436
It would've been nice if you told us.

140
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,229
We don't know how to react to this.

141
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,815
-What should we do?
-What's there to ask?

142
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,486
Hyun-yi, you keep making good food
while Seung-kwon serves the tables.

143
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,323
Yi-seo is right.

144
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,366
None of that matters. Just focus on work.

145
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,785
-Okay.
-Okay.

146
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,419
LEE HO-JIN

147
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,924
Hey. Right now?

148
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,134
I have time. Why?

149
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,891
Okay, ma'am.

150
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,476
I think it'll be fine.

151
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,897
Hello.

152
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,402
This is important.

153
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,322
Yes, I thought she should also hear it.

154
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,366
Let's sit down.

155
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,084
I wanted to introduce her to you one day.

156
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,295
I'm Jo Yi-seo, the manager of DanBam.

157
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,631
I saw you at Chairman Jang's seminar.

158
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,342
You're the one

159
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,595
who uploaded
Geun-won's confession on the web.

160
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,264
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,725
I know I'm working with Saeroyi right now.

162
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,270
But I'm a director at Jangga Co.

163
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,564
Do you know how much our stock price

164
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,649
has plummeted because of you?

165
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,318
But that was

166
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,654
bound to happen one day.

167
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,992
-What?
-She's right.

168
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,245
Yi-seo and I already talked about that.

169
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,497
What do you mean?

170
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,500
Chairman Jang represents Jangga Co.

171
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,044
What do you think will happen
to the stock price

172
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,297
once you replace Chairman Jang

173
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,173
and become the chairwoman?

174
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,595
You're very straightforward for a kid.
What's your point?

175
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,931
I think now is your chance.

176
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,605
The stock price plummeted
because of Chairman Jang's family issues.

177
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,566
This already happened in the past,
and it's happening again.

178
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,528
What do you think the stockholders
are thinking right now?

179
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,407
This is probably what's going on
in their minds.

180
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,037
"This family doesn't deserve
to lead Jangga Co."

181
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,962
-Are you saying--
-Yes.

182
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,633
Now is the right time

183
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,760
to dismiss the chairman.

184
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,148
What do you think?

185
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,904
I think it's more than possible.

186
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,410
Keep going.

187
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,372
But like I said earlier,

188
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,332
Chairman Jang represents Jangga Co.

189
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,669
There's too much at risk
to recklessly start a fight.

190
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,338
If things go haywire,
it'll end up destroying you instead.

191
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,050
So first of all,
we need to satisfy two conditions.

192
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,635
"Two conditions"?

193
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,596
The recording went public,

194
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,556
but it still doesn't have
much legal force.

195
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,059
He didn't even get charged
for what he did.

196
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,228
Here's the first condition.

197
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,331
Dad, why aren't you eating?

198
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,379
Hye-won.

199
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,759
I need to tell you something.

200
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,847
A long time ago,

201
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,308
I did something really bad

202
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,020
to Saeroyi.

203
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,654
You didn't have to come with me.

204
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,158
My life depends on this.
It's right that I come with you.

205
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,955
Isn't he...

206
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,506
Detective.

207
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,593
Hey, Saeroyi.

208
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,012
What's the matter?

209
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,891
The thing is, Hye-won...

210
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,685
What?

211
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,229
Hye-won!

212
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,233
Hye-won!

213
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,656
Hye-won!

214
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,076
My gosh.

215
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,287
Why does she disappear all the time?

216
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,164
Hye-won!

217
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,249
Hye-won!

218
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,339
My gosh...

219
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,591
I think she was too startled.

220
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,014
I made up my mind

221
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,766
to turn myself in.

222
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,603
And I bet she was really disappointed.

223
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,438
Gosh.

224
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,565
She ran out while I was talking.

225
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,111
Hye-won!

226
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,404
Hye-won!

227
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,912
Hye-won!

228
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,540
My goodness.

229
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,838
Hey! Kid!

230
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,343
Hye-won.

231
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,433
Hello...

232
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,895
My gosh, you practically made me exercise.

233
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,816
Why would you run away from home?
You're just an elementary school kid.

234
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,490
Hye-won!

235
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,828
Hye-won.

236
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,674
What my dad did

237
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,927
to Saeroyi's dad...

238
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,140
He shouldn't have done that as a cop.

239
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,019
I feel really sorry about what happened.

240
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,566
Are you disappointed in your dad?

241
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,985
Yes. But...

242
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,072
Saeroyi, I'm sorry for saying this.

243
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,534
But I don't want my dad
to get punished either.

244
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,828
I don't want him to leave me.

245
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,836
I bet your dad's been
having a hard time as well.

246
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,172
Just like you,

247
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,424
he didn't want to be apart from you.

248
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,843
Everyone

249
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,095
makes mistakes.

250
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,806
But not everyone takes responsibility.

251
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,475
Only the brave can do that.

252
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,564
You told me that you're proud
of your dad, right?

253
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,567
Yes.

254
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,781
Your dad mustered up his courage
and decided to take responsibility

255
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,660
so he could be the proud dad
that you think he is.

256
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,955
So why don't you try and understand him?

257
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,382
Dad.

258
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,598
Hye-won.

259
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,439
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,775
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,739
From now on,

262
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,325
I'll be an honorable person.

263
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,202
So please don't cry.

264
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,496
Here's the first condition.

265
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,873
Jang Geun-won needs to get charged.

266
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,336
And in order for that to happen,
Detective Oh needs to turn himself in.

267
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,927
Don't cry.

268
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,180
He's here!

269
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,523
Mr. Jang, did you really cover up
a hit-and-run accident?

270
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,899
How do you feel?

271
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,235
How is the case going? Please tell us.

272
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,446
Didn't your father cover up the accident?

273
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,698
Mr. Jang, how do you feel right now?

274
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,369
I'll do my best to cooperate
with the investigation.

275
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,998
Does that mean you plead guilty?

276
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,292
-Did you really commit a hit-and-run?
-Mr. Jang.

277
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,919
Jang Geun-won got booked
without physical detention.

278
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,380
That satisfied the first condition.

279
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,965
It's time for the second one.

280
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,468
Ms. Kang, you need to find out
what Chairman Jang wants.

281
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,428
What he wants?

282
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,640
You need to know
if he will protect his son, do nothing,

283
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,226
or even worse, abandon him.

284
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,688
This is very important.

285
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,234
What if he abandons him?

286
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,612
I'm afraid

287
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,197
we should give up.

288
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,911
That's ridiculous.

289
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,498
If we gather the stocks of Ms. Kang,
the executives who support her,

290
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,333
and those who are now
against the chairman,

291
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,585
this fight will be ours to win.
So why would we give up?

292
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,253
We'll have the upper hand

293
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,381
if he tries to protect his son
or just decides to remain silent.

294
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,302
But if he chooses the company
over his own son,

295
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:12,265
it'll be more than enough
to calm the restless stockholders.

296
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,684
Chairman Jang has
a lot of love for his family.

297
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,895
But will he choose the company

298
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,231
or his son?

299
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,276
He'll abandon his son.

300
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,947
Why do you think so?

301
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,698
That just feels like

302
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,119
what Chairman Jang would do.

303
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,747
That means we've been
doing all this for nothing.

304
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,541
Are you aware of that?

305
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,044
I think it's best
that we also think of a second plan.

306
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,005
Instead of dismissing the chairman,
how about we gather more evidence

307
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,049
-and have him get investigated--
-And do what?

308
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,886
Reveal the truth
regarding your father's death?

309
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,972
Saeroyi, you need to be realistic.

310
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,474
-Hey--
-Do you think Chairman Jang

311
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,310
would've made any mistakes
regarding that case?

312
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,313
Even the prosecution couldn't prove
that he was involved.

313
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,816
Everything was prepared meticulously
before he covered it up.

314
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,110
You know what I mean, Ms. Kang.

315
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,196
Look how he reacted
to the previous boycott up until now.

316
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,158
Chairman Jang already knows
how incompetent Jang Geun-won is.

317
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,451
But he still chose him as his successor.

318
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,876
Chairman Jang will never abandon his son.

319
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,254
We still have time.

320
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,673
It's always good to be careful.

321
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,009
Let's see how things turn out.

322
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,396
Mr. Jang gave his statement
based on the materials I gave him.

323
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,566
And the recording
didn't get chosen as evidence.

324
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,402
Even with the detective's confession

325
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,155
and this photo of the CCTV footage,

326
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,284
he'll be set free due to lack of evidence.
I think we have a chance here.

327
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,369
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

328
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,623
You can prove his innocence?

329
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,166
Yes, sir.

330
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,295
I'm relieved.

331
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,255
You're relieved?

332
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,592
Do you know what happened to the company

333
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,969
because of that mouth of yours?

334
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,388
Our stock price has decreased
by 12 percent.

335
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,391
Do you know how much money we've lost?

336
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,727
I'm...

337
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,395
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,400
Let's end it here. You may all leave.

339
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,154
Ms. Oh, I want you to stay.

340
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,407
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir?

341
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,868
Ask the secretary for some tea.

342
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,328
Yes, sir.

343
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,265
Nothing is going my way

344
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,934
because of my son.

345
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,355
Raising a child
is the hardest thing to do.

346
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,984
Sir.

347
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,071
You told me that you think of me
like family, right?

348
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,325
That's why I feel comfortable enough
to tell you how upset I am.

349
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,413
It's really difficult for me
to say this to you.

350
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,915
But I think

351
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,669
you need to have your son dismissed.

352
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,383
You want me to dismiss Geun-won?

353
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,386
Yes.

354
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,471
What are you saying? Didn't you hear?

355
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,974
He can be proven innocent.

356
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,810
It doesn't matter if he's innocent or not.

357
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,313
People are boycotting our products
due to the recording.

358
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,149
And what about your position
in the company?

359
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,613
If Ms. Kang decides to betray you
in this kind of situation,

360
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,532
it can be very dangerous for you.

361
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,328
There is only one way

362
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,580
to deal with this issue.

363
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,377
You must

364
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,840
take charge and dismiss your son.

365
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,648
Sit down.

366
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,703
I haven't told you why I started

367
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,955
Jangga Co. yet, have I?

368
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,794
I was born as the eldest of four siblings

369
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,254
during such a turbulent period.

370
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,343
My youngest sibling starved to death.

371
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,638
And my other two siblings died

372
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,556
after eating rotten food
out in the street.

373
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,564
I built Jangga Co. so that my family

374
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,944
could eat good food
and will never have to starve again.

375
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,781
But you want me

376
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,118
to abandon

377
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,954
my own son?

378
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,874
That's absolute nonsense.

379
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,336
-But sir--
-A small business should know

380
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,380
the characteristics of the neighborhood.

381
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,717
And a good company should always be aware
of the current trend.

382
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,846
What about top leading companies
like Jangga Co.?

383
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,228
We need to know the characteristics
of the Korean people.

384
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,231
They get excited and bored with things
very easily.

385
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,275
They're quick to forget
everything that happens.

386
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,528
A 12 percent decrease in stock price?

387
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,823
Do you know how bad it was
eight years ago during the boycott?

388
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,284
It decreased by 37 percent.

389
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,204
It almost decreased by half,
but it came back to normal in six months.

390
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,664
Why?

391
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,001
It's the essence of a food company.

392
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:15,837
It's because our products

393
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,922
are delicious.

394
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,473
You think Min-jung will betray me?

395
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,934
I'm sure she wants to be my successor.

396
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,186
But betraying me?

397
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,607
I'm the only person

398
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,985
who can represent Jangga Co.

399
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,406
And Min-jung knows that
better than anyone.

400
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,379
I apologize.

401
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,257
I was too thoughtless.

402
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,137
Don't you dare...

403
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,433
Don't you dare

404
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,269
tell me to abandon

405
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,272
my family ever again.

406
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,912
HE THINKS YOU WANT TO BE THE SUCCESSOR

407
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,789
BUT HE DOESN'T THINK YOU WILL BETRAY HIM

408
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,013
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KANG MIN-JUNG

409
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,140
Hey, Ms. Kang.

410
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,809
Yes.

411
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,988
Then should we give it a shot?

412
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,547
They must be fucking crazy.

413
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,516
PROPOSAL TO DISMISS THE CHAIRMAN

414
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,560
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

415
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,692
I'm glad you chose to do this.

416
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,362
Jangga Co. is a company.

417
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:51,075
It's not just any company.
It's the top food company in our country.

418
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,288
We can't let the chairman's family matters
influence the company.

419
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,332
I don't feel comfortable

420
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,710
doing this to the chairman
since I've known him for so long--

421
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,715
-You fucking rats.
-What do you think you're doing?

422
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,514
A proposal to dismiss the chairman?

423
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,810
Are you crazy?

424
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,898
-What did you say?
-How could you of all people

425
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,942
do this to my father?

426
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,361
He's done nothing wrong!

427
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,864
Guess why we're doing this.

428
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,370
It's because of you.

429
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,248
We're doing this because he appointed
a fool like you as a director.

430
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,334
We're doing this
because he chose to protect you

431
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,170
over the company.

432
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,259
-But you told me--
-I told you that the company

433
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,304
will take care of it.

434
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,809
And that's what we're doing.

435
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,354
Do you understand?

436
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,405
Let's carry on.

437
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:35,930
Soo-ah.

438
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,940
I saw the proposal
to dismiss the chairman.

439
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,820
It's because of me.

440
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,157
-Because of me, my dad--
-I told him

441
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,326
that he should

442
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,704
dismiss you.

443
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,917
But he got angry at me
and told me that he can't do that.

444
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:07,920
What?

445
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,465
"Blood is thicker than water."

446
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,760
I hate that saying more than anything.

447
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,973
But I guess it's true.

448
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,446
JANGGA CO. IN CRISIS
WILL CHAIRMAN JANG GET DISMISSED?

449
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,833
Are you okay?

450
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,047
Why? Are you worried about me?

451
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,465
What are you talking about?

452
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,219
But to be honest,
you do seem like the vulnerable type.

453
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,807
I thought

454
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,851
I'd be fine.

455
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,730
But I can't imagine

456
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,150
my dad breaking down.

457
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,322
I guess I never wanted to see it.

458
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,036
It's absurd,

459
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,205
isn't it?

460
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,416
How could I feel this way

461
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,628
even when I know
what my dad has done to Saeroyi?

462
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,012
It's normal.

463
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,516
Whatever they say,

464
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,395
he's still your dad.

465
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,405
JANGGA CO. IN CRISIS
WILL CHAIRMAN JANG GET DISMISSED?

466
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,701
I don't understand anything.

467
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,369
What's going to happen now?

468
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,329
Let me break it down for you.

469
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,082
The stockholders are going to vote

470
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,168
whether they want Chairman Jang
to get dismissed.

471
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,752
They're going to decide by majority.

472
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,841
Geun-soo is here.

473
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,316
We were talking about
Chairman Jang's dismissal.

474
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,359
Boss, come on.

475
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,153
I'm sure you know this.

476
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,488
Your dad is my enemy.

477
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,657
To make him pay for his sins

478
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,827
and become more successful than him
are my goals.

479
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,330
And in order to do that,

480
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,919
I will do anything.

481
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,546
Boss, you don't need to say that
in front of--

482
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,881
You see...

483
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,262
I can't change my plan
because of how you might feel

484
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,306
or because I consider your feelings.

485
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,559
And I don't want to.

486
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,190
I'm sure you also don't want me
to do things that I don't mean.

487
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,360
You knew everything
but still chose to stay.

488
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,256
I'm sorry.

489
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,675
I'm going to get some air.

490
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,473
Did you have to be so harsh?

491
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,950
This was bound to happen one day.

492
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,161
You know that, right?

493
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,013
I can't change my plan
because of how you might feel

494
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,140
or because I consider your feelings.

495
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,600
To make him pay for his sins

496
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,729
and become more successful than him
are my goals.

497
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,981
And in order to do that,

498
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,234
I will do anything.

499
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,070
Everything he said is right.

500
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,407
On top of that,

501
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,953
I was even impressed.

502
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,041
But in the end,
you just turned out to be a loser

503
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,628
who had no balls to go after me
or the company.

504
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,980
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

505
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,899
you should

506
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,109
take over Jangga Co.

507
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,945
So you're saying it's okay for me

508
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,200
to want you, right?

509
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,335
NATIONAL COOKING CONTEST
SILVER PRIZE, JANGGA PUB

510
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,093
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

511
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,351
I thought I'd drop by
before heading to the prosecutor's office.

512
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,605
I'll tell them what Attorney Kang
told me to say.

513
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,858
Then I can get back to work
starting from tomorrow.

514
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,444
Okay.

515
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,865
Dad.

516
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,535
-About the general meeting of--
-All my life,

517
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,996
I worked to build this company.

518
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,923
Jangga Co. is my life.

519
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,050
I, Jang Dae-hee, am

520
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,095
Jangga Co. itself.

521
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,806
Right.

522
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,600
No one can

523
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,687
drive me out.

524
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,402
You take care of your own business.

525
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,945
Don't worry about me.

526
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,532
I'll see you later then.

527
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,076
Geun-won.

528
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,724
I always cared about handing
this company over to you.

529
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,770
So I've tried to discipline you.

530
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,608
But as your dad,

531
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,527
I've never given you

532
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,948
a warm hug even once.

533
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,147
Dad.

534
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,566
You should get going.

535
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,073
Mr. Kim, give him a ride.

536
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,243
Yes, sir.

537
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,706
I'll see you later.

538
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,253
Dad.

539
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,507
Hang in there.

540
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,696
Let's get going then.

541
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,031
Pardon?

542
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,827
We still have four hours left.

543
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,525
How dare you come here?

544
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,405
I'm here to cast a vote as a shareholder.

545
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,824
To have Chairman Jang dismissed.

546
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,660
You jerk.

547
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,498
Thank you.

548
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,253
I couldn't see the end of it.

549
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,340
But thanks to you, it seems possible.

550
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,510
Park Saeroyi!

551
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,179
Director Jang.

552
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,806
You can't make things worse here.

553
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,268
We don't have time. Let's go.

554
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,072
We're not someone you can deal with.

555
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,573
Me

556
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,700
and my dad.

557
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,244
Go ahead and get your own way.

558
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,580
And see if it works.

559
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,397
I can't calm myself down.

560
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,150
When does the shareholders' meeting begin?

561
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,985
In three hours.

562
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,490
Gosh. I'm glad Geun-soo is off today.

563
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,534
No matter how the result turns out,

564
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,412
I don't know how to react in front of him.

565
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,541
Boss said before. You don't have to do
things you don't mean.

566
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,042
I'm just being considerate.

567
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,046
Both Saeroyi and you are so brutal.

568
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,549
Hey, guys. Hang on.

569
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,760
Look at this.

570
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,103
I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THE TROUBLE

571
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,316
PRESS CONFERENCE OF CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

572
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,004
Thank you all

573
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,300
for coming all the way here.
I'm Jang Dae-hee.

574
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,554
Today,

575
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,641
I'm here as a father of a son,

576
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,394
not as the chairman...

577
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,479
URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

578
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,022
...of Jangga Co.

579
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,942
A press conference?

580
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,528
That old codger.

581
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,573
What is he up to?

582
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,451
First of all,

583
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,996
I'm sorry for all the trouble
my son has caused.

584
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,998
As his father...

585
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,666
Dad.

586
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,002
I didn't discipline my son
in the right way.

587
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,880
I deeply regret it

588
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,965
and apologize.

589
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,772
My son

590
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,027
is suspected of a hit-and-run accident
from ten years ago,

591
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,323
so he's being questioned by prosecutors.

592
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,451
According to our attorney,

593
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,746
there's not enough physical
and circumstantial evidence

594
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,415
against him.

595
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,918
So my son is

596
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,589
going to be found not guilty.

597
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,260
He will never be able
to win the shareholders over like that.

598
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,470
He's totally mistaken.

599
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,932
A few days ago, when my son came back

600
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,059
from the first prosecutor's investigation,

601
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,519
I...

602
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,902
I heard it

603
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,991
from my son.

604
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,954
The hit-and-run accident
from ten years ago

605
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,920
was his doing.

606
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,761
We're doomed.

607
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:35,037
With the money I trusted him with,

608
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,541
he hired someone else...

609
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,751
Pull over.

610
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,130
...to take the fault.

611
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,049
CHAIRMAN JANG ADMITS HIS SON'S GUILT

612
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,427
Did you not hear me?

613
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,596
I told you to pull over.

614
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,265
I was ordered to drive you
to the Public Prosecutors' Office.

615
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,650
I couldn't believe my ears.

616
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,152
That day,

617
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,156
I looked into the case immediately

618
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,617
and found out

619
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,828
what my son said was true.

620
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,823
Damn it.

621
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,785
What?

622
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,620
I am solely to blame for it.

623
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,832
I was so preoccupied
with running the company

624
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,126
that I failed to discipline my son.

625
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,547
It's all my fault.

626
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,592
What am I supposed
to do for my son's sake?

627
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,805
What is the right thing to do as a father?

628
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,224
I'm a foolish father.

629
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,520
I hesitated
even after finding out the truth.

630
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,982
But feeling desperate,

631
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,152
as soon as it turned out to be true,

632
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,075
I took all the evidence
to the prosecution.

633
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,453
Is it possible that he didn't know?

634
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,080
How is it even possible?

635
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,959
That's the last thing I can do

636
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,297
as a foolish father.

637
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,175
He must pay

638
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,846
for the crime he committed.

639
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,824
To the victim who passed away
because of my son

640
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,660
and his family,

641
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,872
I sincerely apologize.

642
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,166
We will

643
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,878
regret it for the rest of our lives.

644
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,963
I'm sorry.

645
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,716
I'm deeply sorry.

646
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,301
I'm sorry.

647
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,138
I sincerely apologize.

648
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,726
I'm terribly sorry.

649
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,155
What's going on?

650
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,420
-He's here.
-There he is.

651
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,882
-Where is your son?
-Is it true your son did it?

652
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,926
Are you not involved in the case?

653
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,427
What are your plans for the future?

654
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,555
Do the prosecutors know about this?

655
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,723
-Please say a word.
-Please answer it, sir.

656
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,351
-Please tell us.
-Chairman Jang.

657
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,520
-Hang on.
-Say something before you leave.

658
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,939
-Please answer the question.
-Chairman Jang.

659
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,691
Let me ask you one more question.

660
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,068
-How are you feeling now?
-What are you going to do?

661
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,320
-There's Jang Geun-won.
-What?

662
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,697
-Where?
-There he is.

663
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,575
-Please say a word.
-Is it all true?

664
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,661
-How are you feeling now?
-It's your father who reported you.

665
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,747
-Is what he said all true?
-How do you feel?

666
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,708
Were you alone in this?

667
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,877
Please say a word.

668
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,842
As your dad,

669
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:03,305
I've never given you a warm hug even once.

670
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,563
Is what your father said true?

671
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,316
Your father reported you
to the prosecution.

672
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,152
How are you feeling now?
Did you do it all alone?

673
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,945
Is your father not involved in the case?

674
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,864
Please answer the question.

675
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,008
Please answer the question.

676
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,263
It's

677
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,685
all my fault.

678
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,270
-Is it all correct?
-Wasn't your father involved?

679
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,065
-Do you admit the charge?
-How do you feel about your father?

680
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,203
Therefore,

681
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,710
the dismissal of the chairman

682
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,759
is rejected.

683
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,652
So we've fallen out with each other,

684
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,238
but I have no grudge against you.

685
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,200
I believe you did
the whole thing for Jangga Co.

686
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,876
Have some.

687
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,088
She makes really good tea.

688
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,175
Oh, right. It's you who planted her.
I guess you know it already.

689
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,392
Chairman Jang.

690
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,270
You may leave.

691
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,904
When did you find out?

692
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:11,367
I thought you knew that I'd been prying.

693
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,330
You should've been more cautious.

694
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,041
That was very clumsy of you.

695
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,754
You just ended up getting paid back.

696
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,097
You must be disappointed.

697
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,059
Not really.

698
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,855
I just didn't know you were that good.

699
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,611
It's not that I have grudge against you,

700
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,823
but I'm quite disappointed.

701
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,866
I can't kick you out though.

702
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,495
I will be too ashamed to face Bo-hyeon.

703
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,505
What are you going to do?

704
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,717
I'll transfer you to the Pajin office

705
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,762
so you can clear your head.

706
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,657
JANGGA PUB

707
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,581
Hey, my partner.

708
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,832
Over here.

709
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:41,916
Hey.

710
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,960
Come have a seat.

711
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,046
I call you my partner,

712
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,340
but we didn't even get to drink once.

713
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:50,925
Here.

714
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,677
Let me pour you a drink.

715
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,933
I'm sorry. I didn't read it right.

716
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,769
That just kills my appetite.
I told you to stop.

717
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,280
What are you going to do now?

718
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,740
I have no choice.

719
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,577
All my people are kicked out.

720
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,999
And I'll be banished.

721
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,751
I'm sorry, Director Kang.

722
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,463
Gosh, that's enough. Will you please stop?

723
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,353
I need to go to the restroom.

724
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,855
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,361
It was my decision.

726
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,863
What is he sorry for?

727
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,201
So

728
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,995
what are you going to do now?

729
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,582
I will have to come up with another way.

730
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,334
Another way?

731
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,504
You mean Chairman Jang?

732
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,387
Yes.

733
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,728
Are you not going to give up
even after ruining the whole thing?

734
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,855
I'm not giving up.

735
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,445
How could I give up?

736
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,616
The odds are stacked against you.

737
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,791
The odds weren't with me
when I was a penniless ex-con

738
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,626
and a high school dropout.

739
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,547
I met a crushing defeat this time,

740
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,216
but Jang Geun-won will pay for his crime,

741
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,218
and Chairman Jang has lost his son.

742
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:01,806
I see. I lost everything though.

743
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,642
I'm a little sad.

744
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,938
Right.

745
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,234
Actually, it's you who lost. Not me.

746
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,236
I'm sorry.

747
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,868
So I will keep on going.

748
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,376
Like I said before,

749
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,338
you're such a jerk.

750
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,263
This watch.

751
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,599
It belonged to Mr. Park.

752
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,768
Right.

753
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,395
I wear this when I have
something important to do.

754
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,902
The 1997 IMF financial crisis.

755
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,487
Jangga was in crisis. I mean,

756
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,740
the whole nation was facing a huge crisis.

757
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:05,203
And there was this dish
that saved Jangga Co. from the crisis.

758
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,456
This one.

759
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,669
The spicy pork with gochujang.

760
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,213
I read it from the autobiography.

761
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,132
It's the signature menu of Jangga Co.
developed by Chairman Jang.

762
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,928
I heard it's made Jangga Co.
what it is now.

763
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,013
Right.

764
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,933
It's not too far-fetched to say

765
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:34,565
that Jangga Co. wouldn't have come
this far without this special sauce.

766
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,821
Marketing always needs a good story.

767
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:44,200
It's just more compelling to say

768
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:48,121
that it was developed by the chairman,

769
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:51,207
not a mere employee.

770
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,627
What?

771
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,132
It's Mr. Park who made the sauce.

772
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,676
It's the dish developed by Mr. Park.

773
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,307
And what he got in return
for giving credit to the chairman

774
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,601
is this watch.

775
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,529
Mr. Park...

776
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:25,867
He should have been the last person
to be kicked out from Jangga like that.

777
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,876
Like you said,
I'm the only one who lost this time.

778
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,546
I just gave up so easily after one defeat.

779
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,965
I bet you'll be a lot better than me.

780
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,303
Director Kang.

781
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,555
Give me your hand.

782
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,348
What?

783
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,821
I've passed the baton.

784
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,161
Make sure to win, Saeroyi.

785
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:27,470
The defendant was aware
that the victim was injured,

786
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,430
but he ran away without rescue actions.

787
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,016
Also, even after he learned
that the victim had died,

788
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,392
he hired someone else

789
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,187
to make a false statement
and cover up the case

790
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,106
without turning himself in.

791
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,109
He has shown no remorse for his crime,

792
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,945
and the nature of the crime
is very serious.

793
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,282
According to Article 54, Section 1
of the Road Traffic Act

794
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,785
and Article 5, Section 3

795
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,871
of the Additional Punishment Law
on Specific Crimes,

796
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,833
the defendant is sentenced
to seven years in prison.

797
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,413
You must be satisfied.

798
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,549
Not at all.

799
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,719
You're sitting comfortably right there.

800
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:02,982
All right.

801
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,736
Having Min-jung on your side
was a fine choice.

802
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,740
But Jangga Co. won't fall apart so easily.

803
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:13,910
I want to ask you.

804
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,873
Is it something you want to protect
even giving up on your own son?

805
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,918
I mean Jangga Co.

806
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:26,714
For Jangga Co.,
I'm willing to do anything.

807
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,717
But you know what?

808
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,304
I still feel quite bitter.

809
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,306
He's just paying for what he did.

810
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,480
You're crossing way over the line.

811
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,026
You haven't paid for what you did yet.

812
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,195
You are

813
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,573
coming up next.

814
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,869
You told me before.

815
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,580
That I'm your enemy.

816
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,751
Fine. I admit it.

817
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,921
I, Jang Dae-hee,

818
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,466
have you for an enemy.

819
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,178
I will

820
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,181
make you regret this.

821
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,435
I will

822
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,065
offer my life

823
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,485
to make the same promise.

824
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,095
It's so close by.

825
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:59,765
But I couldn't come to see you even once.

826
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,856
I'm a horrible son who went to jail

827
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,234
without finishing your funeral.

828
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,530
I felt too bad

829
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,702
to come see you.

830
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,585
PARK SUNG-YEOL

831
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:37,595
JANG GEUN-WON OF JANGGA CO. WHO TRIED TO
COVER UP HIS MURDER ENDS UP IN PRISON

832
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,902
I was such a bad son,

833
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,115
but I have a lot of good people around me.

834
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,456
You must've been worried leaving me alone.

835
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,239
But you don't have to worry anymore.

836
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,407
Please rest in peace.

837
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,805
How does it taste?

838
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,481
My son.

839
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,288
It's still...

840
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:33,836
bitter.

841
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,080
I'll leave DanBam.

842
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,707
You've been holding out well.

843
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,375
Why do you want to quit now?

844
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,794
I will live with greed.

845
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,130
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Oh.

846
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,342
It's too soon to attract investment
to start something.

847
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:23,677
-When will we catch up with Jangga Co.?
-Yi-Seo.

848
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,305
Did you have feelings for Yi-seo before?

849
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:29,099
You're a smart girl.
Why are you acting like a kid?

850
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:30,351
I love you.

851
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,269
I really love you.

852
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,112
