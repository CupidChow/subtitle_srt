ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,351
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,352
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,605
Hello, my name is Park Saeroyi.

5
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,482
You can sit there.

6
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,441
Come on, you loser.

7
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,277
Don't you know that I hate plain milk?

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,780
Leave it.
He's the successor of Jangga Co.

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,864
That's your reason?

10
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,451
Being a rich doesn't mean
you can be an asshole.

11
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,371
Sir, you're here.

12
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,874
Mr. Park. I heard he's your son.

13
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,627
My dad's employee's son
had the guts to hit me?

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,961
So you refuse to kneel.

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,340
I'm doing what I think is right.
And I wish to continue living like that.

16
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,176
But you ended up
getting expelled from school.

17
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,971
I know I always told you
to stick to your beliefs.

18
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,015
But I failed to do that myself.

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,268
And today, I could see
you were already living like that.

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,480
How does it taste?

21
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,315
It's sweet.

22
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,567
That means you had
a very impressive day today.

23
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,528
I'll be right there.

24
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,669
That night, Dad didn't come back.

25
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,715
These are the photos of the scene.
The suspect wants to reach a settlement.

26
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,425
Why is it here?

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,594
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

28
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,012
This is Jang Geun-won's car.

29
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,722
Saeroyi.

30
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,684
You jerk. Why did you kill my dad?

31
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,061
Why?

32
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,439
Die!

33
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,150
Beliefs. Ambition.

34
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,820
They’re words used by those
who have nothing but their ego.

35
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,073
If you gain nothing,
that's just being stubborn and foolish.

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,451
Jangga Co. offered to support me
with a scholarship.

37
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,246
I'm not strong like you. I'm a coward.

38
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,540
-I'm sorry.
-You made a choice.

39
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,916
So just stick to it.

40
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,377
Revenge.

41
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,882
I like this place.

42
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,717
I love it.

43
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,761
Itaewon?
You said you'd open your own business.

44
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,597
-When will you start?
-In seven years.

45
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,391
I haven't seen Saeroyi

46
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,894
since that day.

47
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,149
And about when my memories
about Saeroyi started to fade...

48
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,319
Soo-ah.

49
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,990
It's been

50
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,075
exactly seven years.

51
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,912
The 22-year-old guy's plan
that sounded rather absurd.

52
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,747
Have you been doing well?

53
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,834
To him, it is...

54
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,296
only natural.

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,095
EPISODE 3

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,270
DANBAM

57
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,982
TIPSY NIGHT, DANBAM

58
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,464
I'm done preparing.

59
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,216
DANBAM

60
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,550
Check if there's rice.

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,723
Both rice and soup are ready.

62
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
To your positions. We'll begin.

63
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,103
Can we please skip it today?

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,355
Just do it, will you?
Don't be such a slacker.

65
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,856
Come on.

66
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,194
Get ready, begin

67
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,990
One, two, three, four

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,076
Five, six, seven, eight

69
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,996
Two, two, three, four

70
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,790
Five, six, seven, eight

71
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,792
-Do it right.
-One, two

72
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,796
three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

73
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,516
DANBAM

74
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,228
YONGGAK HIGH SCHOOL

75
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,439
Are you crazy?
I told you to buy baked goods.

76
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,983
-Are you kidding me?
-Those were all sold out.

77
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,527
Still, how could you pick up plain bread?

78
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,070
You idiot.

79
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,282
You want me to eat it without jam
and choke on it, don't you?

80
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,243
Hold a sign saying you're an idiot
if you're this stupid.

81
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,996
Girls, hold her.
I'll write it on your face.

82
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,623
-Let go!
-Let me borrow it.

83
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,752
Jeez, stay still.

84
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,003
Don't be so selfish.

85
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,589
Others need to know that you are an idiot.

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,090
I'll buy you something better.

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,467
Hey, be quiet.

88
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,678
I heard you, so stay still.
Otherwise, I'm going to tell my boyfriend.

89
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,223
-I told you to stay still.
-Gosh.

90
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,351
Stay still, will you?

91
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,145
Others need to know that you are an idiot.

92
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,856
-I'll buy you something better.
-Okay, stay still.

93
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,524
A senior at Yonggak High School,

94
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,903
Miss Guk... A borough chief's daughter
bullying a friend.

95
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,322
-Because there's no jam...
-There are still bullies?

96
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,407
-So scary.
-The world is a scary place.

97
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,700
Those kids need a lesson.

98
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,036
-I applaud your courage.
-That's just too much.

99
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,662
-Bad parenting...
-Horrible.

100
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,248
-Which school is this?
-Too much. It's just too much.

101
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,631
Jo Yi-seo.

102
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,134
She's a social media star
with 760,000 followers

103
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,220
and an influential blogger.

104
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,975
MY FAVORITE CAKE

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,357
She transferred from New York last year.

106
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,860
-Hey, over here!
-Hey!

107
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,823
She's athletic.

108
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,325
GRADE REPORT
JO YI-SEO

109
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,785
She gets good grades.

110
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,828
REPORT CARD
TOTAL 100%

111
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,376
She's multitalented.

112
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,881
She's good at everything.
A genius girl with an IQ of 162.

113
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,100
If angels existed,

114
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,811
they'd probably look like her.

115
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,523
Who is Jo Yi-seo?

116
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,900
Who the hell is Jo Yi-seo?

117
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,863
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

118
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,780
Are you

119
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,908
-Jo Yi-seo?
-Yes.

120
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,995
Did you post this?

121
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,122
Yes, that was me indeed.

122
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,500
Do you know who I am?

123
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,044
How dare you slander my daughter?

124
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,214
Despite her angelic face...

125
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,218
Geun-soo.

126
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,637
Did you get that?

127
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,683
Yi-seo is quite evil.

128
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,311
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

129
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,813
I did not "slander" her.
What I posted is a fact.

130
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,858
Did she do it to you?
It's none of your business.

131
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,526
That's not true.

132
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,529
She bullies classmates for no reason
and extorts money from them.

133
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,406
Also, she just took my pen and used it.

134
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,701
I wasn't going to post anything else,

135
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,622
but my cheek

136
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,707
hurts a little.

137
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,466
This is why parents
must teach their kids well.

138
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,468
Look at this crazy rude bitch.

139
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,345
What did you say?

140
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,055
Say that again.

141
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,723
Say that again--

142
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,728
That video clip...

143
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,273
When she enters college,
I'll post it on the school's website.

144
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,568
Then when she gets a job,
I'll send it to the company as well.

145
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,363
I'll even send it to her in-laws
when she's getting married.

146
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,241
Whose fault do you think it is?

147
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,245
-And if she gets pregnant--
-You crazy bitch.

148
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,000
Hold on.

149
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,044
I don't know what's going on,
but calm down.

150
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,088
Let go. Who the hell are you?

151
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,181
And Yi-seo is

152
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,061
-Counter.
-a sociopath.

153
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,857
How nosy.

154
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,874
Hey, wait.

155
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,546
What was that about?

156
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,090
You can't take off
after slapping someone like that.

157
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,925
What do you even know?

158
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,178
-What?
-You said yourself

159
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,848
-that you don't know what's going on.
-It doesn't matter.

160
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,271
My dad died because of that woman.

161
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,611
Would you swallow your anger
just because she's older than you?

162
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,211
That was a lie.

163
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,474
What the hell?

164
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,609
-Damn.
-Jeez.

165
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,070
What? What's wrong?

166
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,614
He's angry because no one's coming.

167
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,324
Shall I go bring customers?

168
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,203
Hey, your face won't exactly
attract customers.

169
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,537
-You little...
-What?

170
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,417
No, it's not that. I just ran
into a crazy girl on my way here.

171
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,753
A crazy girl? What did she do?

172
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,962
Was she pretty?

173
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,841
Men are nuts. Is that important now?

174
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,468
What? Aren't you a guy too?

175
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,098
Wait, maybe you're not.
You look like a girl.

176
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,183
Forget it. Let's drop this.

177
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,977
So? Was she pretty?

178
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,563
Hey, think about your face.

179
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,357
Gosh.

180
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,485
Hey, have you lost your mind?

181
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,488
You punk,
how could you slap her in the face?

182
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,157
Why can't I?

183
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,785
What? "Why can't I"?

184
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,788
Hey, do you know who she is?

185
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:52,336
Right. So because she's an adult
and her husband is the borough chief,

186
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,548
I should've just let her hit me
and sucked it up?

187
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,591
-What?
-Right.

188
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,679
It'll be a hassle to deal with him
asking you to do something about it.

189
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,889
-You little--
-Sir.

190
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,267
She's my student,
so I'll have a word with her.

191
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,102
Yi-seo, wait in the classroom.

192
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,312
-Sure thing.
-"Sure thing"?

193
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,647
What? "Sure thing"?

194
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,483
-Hey, stop right there. I said, stop!
-Sir.

195
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,110
Hey, Jo Yi-seo!

196
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,865
We have a deficit for three months
at Jangga Pub in Itaewon.

197
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,410
The locations near Hongik University
and Konkuk University are profitable

198
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,412
because they're known as hookup spots.

199
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,415
So I've come up with an idea

200
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,251
to help facilitate that
for our Itaewon location.

201
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,837
To help guys pick up girls and vice versa?

202
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,047
Yes, this is it.

203
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,010
If we develop our own mobile application

204
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,512
for meeting with other singles
at Jangga Pub,

205
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,639
they will become popular hookup spots.

206
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,808
I'm sure of it.

207
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,643
What do you think, Ms. Kang?

208
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,772
Well...
I don't love the idea.

209
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,107
I think it's worth trying.

210
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,110
Ms. Oh, what do you think?

211
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,947
I'm against it.

212
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,075
Jangga Pub is our main brand.

213
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,496
The two pubs near the universities
got such reputation

214
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,623
because of their locations.

215
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,583
We didn't intend that to happen.

216
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,211
Encouraging people to view our pubs
as hookup spots

217
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,838
will hurt our brand image
because Jangga Pub takes pride

218
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,590
in offering great-tasting foods.

219
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,384
Thinking that it'll hurt
our brand image...

220
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,428
That thought itself

221
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,639
is too old-fashioned.

222
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,937
And most importantly,

223
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,191
such a concept doesn't suit Itaewon.

224
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,072
What makes you say that?

225
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,573
I agree with her.

226
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,450
It's targeting a specific clientele.

227
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,619
Men usually pick up girls
at clubs or lounges.

228
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,705
Advertising it as a hookup spot
will make the brand look cheap.

229
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,377
But young people these days
may love the idea.

230
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,670
What?

231
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,923
-Are you saying I'm old?
-They're right.

232
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,550
Dad.

233
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,635
I mean, sir.

234
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,595
What's the average age in Itaewon?

235
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,056
-Sorry?
-You don't know?

236
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,225
That's...

237
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,857
The restaurants in Itaewon
are on the pricier side.

238
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,695
Therefore, the customers' ages
range from the mid-20s to late 30s,

239
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,697
basically those who can afford
such prices.

240
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,701
Do you think
they come all the way to Itaewon

241
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,661
to meet other singles?

242
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,373
Taste.

243
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,292
Ambiance.

244
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,004
The quality one would expect
based on the prices.

245
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,214
The basics of a restaurant.

246
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,261
It's an area where we must fight head-on.

247
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,598
A trashy idea like this won't cut it.

248
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,313
We can't keep the deficit.

249
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,733
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,360
I want you to manage it
for the time being.

251
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,862
Sure.

252
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,907
Dad, let me manage the Yongsan--

253
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,462
Three months of deficit
at that prime location?

254
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,633
You're an idiot.

255
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,403
Oh Soo-ah.

256
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,910
What's up with you?

257
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,037
Your idea wasn't going
to be approved anyway.

258
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,664
Then win some points.

259
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,876
That's all you can think about.

260
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,753
Points?

261
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,588
Sure, okay.

262
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,842
Come to your senses, Soo-ah.
You need to choose your side wisely.

263
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,936
How long do you think
my dad will be in his position?

264
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,897
Five years? Ten years?

265
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,566
His position will be mine soon,

266
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,735
you know?

267
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,490
It'd be foolish of you
to get on my wrong side.

268
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,078
Are you sure?

269
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,205
What?

270
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,251
Are you sure

271
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,795
you're inheriting it?

272
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,776
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

273
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,663
I'm stressed out about CSAT these days,
so I've been pigging out.

274
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,707
-Bullshit.
-But I haven't gained any weight.

275
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,586
Jamsu Bridge.

276
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,816
BACK TO BASICS, JANGGA CO.

277
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,736
Beliefs. Ambition.

278
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,364
They’re words used by those
who have nothing but their ego.

279
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,451
If you gain nothing,

280
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,245
that's just being stubborn and foolish.

281
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,093
I'll explain again slowly.

282
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,720
What do you need to open
to count the cash?

283
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,306
DANBAM

284
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,599
Just click on it.

285
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,936
-What?
-Jeez.

286
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,523
Gosh.

287
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,943
How many times do I have to go over
the same thing?

288
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,778
-Are you an idiot?
-He is.

289
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,446
You're early.

290
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,448
Yes, I had nothing to do anyway.

291
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,743
By the way, we got a package.
Did you order that?

292
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,869
Oh, it came.

293
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,038
It's huge. What is it?

294
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,499
-Bring me a knife.
-Okay.

295
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,216
It has been so slow, you know.
We should do something.

296
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,677
It's for marketing.

297
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,433
What is this?

298
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,227
For marketing?

299
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,363
Yi-seo.

300
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,825
What? What brings you here?

301
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,827
I saw your photo. You were close by.

302
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,122
Didn't you post it for me to see?

303
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,708
What the hell?
Are you stalking me or what?

304
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,588
It's cold. Why are you here?

305
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,008
Have you ever thought

306
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,720
that it would've been better
if you had never been born?

307
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,222
No.

308
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,474
Why would you think that?

309
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,727
Just because.

310
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,646
We all grow old and die, you know.

311
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,860
But we have to study and do other things
fully knowing that,

312
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,111
until the day we die.

313
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,907
Isn't life so tiring?

314
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,950
So what?

315
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,702
Are you here to die?

316
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,704
No.

317
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm too good for that.

318
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,629
It's good that you're here.
Let's go for a ride.

319
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,340
I have plans though.

320
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,927
"Plans"? Who's this bitch?

321
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,180
Well, I have to go to Itaewon.

322
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,974
I'm going clubbing with a friend of mine.

323
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,478
Look at you.
Aren't you a high school senior?

324
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,897
-I'll come with you.
-No, you can't.

325
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,317
-He's a friend you don't know.
-I see. You're going to meet up

326
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,612
with a friend that I don't know
to dance with girls

327
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,156
and get their phone numbers?

328
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,866
Cut it out.

329
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,202
Hey, who hangs out together at clubs?

330
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,579
Once you get in, you're on your own.

331
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,916
Let's go. Don't get on my nerves.

332
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,046
Okay, fine. Do whatever you want.

333
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,341
Hold tight.

334
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,177
Let's go.

335
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,953
You asshole!

336
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,539
Jo Yi-seo!

337
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,679
-My gosh!
-Oh, no!

338
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,640
-I think she's hurt badly.
-What happened?

339
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,767
Are you all right?

340
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,769
What happened?

341
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,771
My goodness.

342
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,649
That was a lie.

343
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,115
You're...

344
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,159
Are you okay?

345
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,078
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

346
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,373
Hold on a moment. Yi-seo!

347
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:55,999
Are you okay?

348
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,419
I almost died.

349
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,635
-Are you all right?
-She's that girl, isn't she?

350
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,347
-Oh...
-You're...

351
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,061
Hey, be careful!

352
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,688
Hey.

353
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,608
Call an ambulance.

354
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,952
JANGGA CO. NAMED BEST FRANCHISE

355
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,912
We've known each other for ten years.

356
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,499
I remember the day when I brewed tea
for you for the first time.

357
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,002
-Pardon me?
-At my place.

358
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,087
You don't remember?

359
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,844
I do. That was the day when we first met.
I remember, of course.

360
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,011
Yes, that day.

361
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,305
My son

362
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,100
killed Mr. Park in that hit-and-run.

363
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,025
Why are you so surprised?
You knew about it.

364
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,323
-That--
-Yes, that day.

365
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,577
You doubted my intentions
for sponsoring you,

366
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,037
thinking that I might ask you
to testify for my son.

367
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,958
Sir.

368
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,796
Ten years.

369
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,716
It's a long time.

370
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,769
Apparently Park Saeroyi

371
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,106
opened a store in Itaewon.

372
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,946
Did you know?

373
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,367
Yes.

374
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,828
It's near Jangga Pub.
Why didn't you tell me?

375
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,541
It's just a small pub
that's not even profitable.

376
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,586
You don't need to worry about it, sir.

377
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,547
What would you do if you were once again

378
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,676
put in the same situation
as ten years ago?

379
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,680
-Pardon?
-Park Saeroyi

380
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,891
and me.

381
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,435
Whom would you choose?

382
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,776
Why so serious?

383
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,569
I'm just wondering, so tell me.

384
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,281
I'm...

385
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,119
I'll always be loyal to Jangga Co.

386
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,579
Yes, good.

387
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,378
I'm old, but I'm still good
at figuring out who to invest in.

388
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,047
This is why I like you.

389
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,424
Thank you, sir.

390
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,053
If you're bothered by DanBam--

391
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,555
No, don't worry.

392
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,765
That punk means nothing to me.

393
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,559
And he's your friend.

394
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,520
Do as you please.

395
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,547
SAEROYI

396
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,138
TIPSY NIGHT
DANBAM

397
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,854
Thankfully,
there are no injuries or brain damage.

398
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,856
Then why did he faint?

399
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,232
He's overworked.

400
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,575
Psycho.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,959
Are you all right?

402
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,211
Am I at the hospital now?

403
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,382
Did I faint?

404
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,345
Yes, the doctor said it probably happened
because you're overworked.

405
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,144
The mask.

406
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,105
Where did the mask go?

407
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,483
Oh, that...

408
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,986
It got ripped,
and they also had to cut it open.

409
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,781
They rushed you into the ambulance,
so we just threw it out.

410
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,618
But I bought it today.

411
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,122
It's expensive because it's custom-made.

412
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,461
I'm sorry. I'll compensate you for it.

413
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,214
Okay.

414
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
DANBAM

415
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,427
You brought the flyers at least.

416
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,686
I guess you run a pub.

417
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,690
I have a small pub in Itaewon,
but it's in dire need of some advertising.

418
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,819
Who gives out flyers wearing a mask
to advertise these days?

419
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,862
Hey, stop it.

420
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,824
Then?

421
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,619
I'm sorry. She's socially inept.

422
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,830
Please understand.

423
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,790
That I already know.

424
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,170
I'm curious. What do people do
these days to advertise their businesses?

425
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,840
Online advertising is much more effective.

426
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,968
Through social media or blogs,
for example.

427
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,680
How do you do that?
Do you have to hire an agency?

428
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,598
You can just look it up online.

429
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,184
But the place needs to be decent,
to begin with.

430
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,232
I only just started, so I don't know much.
I'll take that into account.

431
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,900
-Thank you.
-Wait.

432
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,863
The doctor told us
that you need to get some rest.

433
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,699
I'm too busy.
You can pay for the hospital bills.

434
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,202
Yes, of course.
I'm really sorry about what happened.

435
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,705
Are you really that sorry?

436
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,540
What?

437
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,709
Yes, of course.

438
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,881
If you're really sorry,
you should visit my pub.

439
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,632
DANBAM PUB

440
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,693
He seems like

441
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,696
a very honest guy.

442
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,990
Honest, my ass.

443
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,660
If I were him, I would've asked
for an extra 5,000,000 won.

444
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,166
Just a second.

445
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,753
-Hey, Seong-hyeon.
-What's wrong with you?

446
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,963
At least call me
that you're going to be late.

447
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm sorry.

448
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,426
Something happened on my way there.

449
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,261
I'm nearby. I'll go right away.

450
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,596
I'm freezing. Hurry.

451
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,057
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

452
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,892
Okay, bye.

453
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,689
I bet you were startled as well.
Do you want to go clubbing next time?

454
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,441
No, I still want to go.

455
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,027
Okay, then let's get going.

456
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,071
He's really angry.

457
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,201
DANBAM PUB

458
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,454
I only just started, so I don't know much.
I'll take that into account.

459
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,872
Thank you.

460
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,708
What's wrong?

461
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,596
-Let's go.
-You're crazy.

462
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,186
TEN YEARS AGO

463
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,188
You're doing great!

464
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,691
-Stay calm! You can do it!
-Run!

465
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,276
-Go!
-You can do it!

466
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,570
Run!

467
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,072
There you go! You can do it!

468
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,408
-Run!
-Run!

469
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,119
-Run!
-Run!

470
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,670
-Run!
-Run!

471
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,839
-Run!
-Run!

472
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,049
-Run!
-Run!

473
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,635
-Did she push her?
-It was her.

474
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,971
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

475
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,933
-Yes!
-What's wrong with her?

476
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,643
What a cheater.

477
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,313
-That's the girl that pushed her.
-It was her.

478
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,275
She seems nice on the outside.
You can't cheat like that!

479
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,568
That's wrong!

480
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,325
She's too obsessed with winning.

481
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,453
She also shows traits
of a sociopath sometimes.

482
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,916
Why don't you take her to a counselor
just in case?

483
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,424
Did you want to win that badly?

484
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,097
Sweetheart, you're unbelievably

485
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,184
versatile.

486
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,395
You're even good at sports.
What aren't you good at?

487
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,732
Are you complimenting me
for having won the race?

488
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,776
Right.

489
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,363
This is so wrong, Mom.

490
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,989
I bet it comes from your trauma.

491
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:33,368
You're using me to make up
for your average life.

492
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,286
My goodness, look at you talk.

493
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,498
You're so smart.

494
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,041
Seriously?

495
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,837
I'm not going to scold you
for something so petty.

496
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,384
I don't want you to end up
living an average life like me.

497
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:56,391
People have their own ways
of making judgments.

498
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,186
So the line between good and bad
can be very vague.

499
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:06,150
But when you're exceptional,
people know it for sure.

500
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,319
Because it's marked with a number.

501
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,881
I know what she meant.

502
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,802
And I know how much my mom loves me.

503
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,055
I understood it all.

504
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,975
I'm an ordinary person.

505
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,811
But I was born smart and pretty.

506
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,649
A prestigious university,
a job at big firm, and a successful life.

507
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,071
People try hard,
but not everyone gets to achieve them.

508
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,073
But I know I will.

509
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,618
I'm hungry to succeed,
and I work hard to get what I want.

510
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,413
I work so damn hard.

511
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,752
I bet I'll be exhausted my entire life.

512
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,932
So why can't the earth

513
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,355
just explode so this can all end?

514
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,292
Is she really a high school student?
She's unbelievable.

515
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,045
I know, right?
She plays so hard.

516
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,797
How do you know her?

517
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,882
She's just a friend.

518
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,884
Really? There's nothing
between you guys?

519
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,637
She's not interested in dating
or falling in love.

520
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,847
That's nonsense. Who doesn't like dating?

521
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,725
Anyway, if you're just friends,
I'll make a move on her.

522
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,185
What?

523
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,605
She's actually my type. See you later.

524
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:09,816
Wait.

525
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,069
Well...

526
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,532
There's nothing going on between us.
We're not dating.

527
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,409
We really are just friends.

528
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,957
But I like her.

529
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,376
Oh, really?

530
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,505
You should've told me earlier.

531
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,174
I almost made a fool of myself.
I mean, come on.

532
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,309
I only just found out myself.

533
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,117
Here. Have a bite.

534
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,787
Are you sure you cooked it properly?

535
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,499
-I followed the recipe on the web.
-Then why isn't it eating it?

536
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,210
Wait a second.

537
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,087
What are you doing?

538
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,590
Here. Try a bite.

539
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,759
It still won't eat.
I thought it was your ugly face.

540
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,179
Maybe your cooking sucks.

541
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,473
What are you doing?

542
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,851
Hey, you're here.

543
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,146
This kitty comes by so often.

544
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,946
Where's the bear suit?
Weren't you wearing it earlier?

545
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,657
Something happened.

546
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,243
But why are you both outside?

547
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,120
Well...

548
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,289
-There aren't any customers.
-My gosh.

549
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,082
None?

550
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,876
-No.
-No.

551
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,466
JANGGA PUB

552
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,635
This is the place you wanted to bring us?

553
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,429
Yes. It's your first time here, right?
This place is famous.

554
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,890
The braised spicy chicken
tastes amazing.

555
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,352
I heard this place sucks.
Let's go somewhere else.

556
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,520
Really? Do you want to go somewhere else?

557
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,023
Let's go inside.

558
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,404
Yi-seo, that brat.

559
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,867
Welcome.

560
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,078
-Three people?
-Yes.

561
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,290
I'm sorry,
but I need to check the lady's ID.

562
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,843
-You look nothing like the photo.
-Really?

563
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,721
It's because I took the photo
before I got my nose filler.

564
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,432
Can you tell me your ID number?

565
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,893
-It's 890731-29...
-Just a second.

566
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,730
Okay, let me take you to your seats.

567
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,778
Wait. Let me check one more thing.

568
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,656
My gosh, you look very young.

569
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,157
I hear that often.

570
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,285
Are you guys all close?

571
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,453
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

572
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,871
Then what's her name?

573
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,914
What?

574
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,457
Jo Yi-seo.

575
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,458
Wrong.

576
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,254
You're out.

577
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,923
KIM SO-HUI

578
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,592
Come back after you graduate.

579
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,516
Come back after you graduate.

580
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,059
Go on.

581
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,479
You fool.

582
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,857
This is so embarrassing.

583
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,152
I'm sorry, Seong-hyeon.

584
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,862
Let's eat next time.

585
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,282
I know a nice dumpling place.
Let's go there.

586
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,828
Instead of having dumplings,
why don't we go there?

587
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,334
DANBAM

588
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,881
We did really bad this month.

589
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,885
Yes. Maybe it's because
he looks too intimidating.

590
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,388
Will you cut it out?
It's because your food isn't good enough.

591
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,973
I can't hear you.

592
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,061
Online advertising is much more effective.

593
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,230
Through social media or blogs,
for example.

594
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,149
Are you guys on social media?

595
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,984
You mean like Myhompy?

596
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,030
Are you kidding me? When were you born?

597
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,742
But why do you ask? I have an account.

598
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,037
I'm thinking about advertising our pub
on social media.

599
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,915
That might be better
than handing out flyers.

600
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
We have customers.

601
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,919
Welcome to DanBam.

602
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,129
-Welcome to DanBam.
-Welcome to DanBam.

603
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,425
You want to eat here?

604
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,094
What...

605
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,767
Here you go.

606
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,729
Do you know them?

607
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,356
I saw them a few times.

608
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,899
I'll be right back.

609
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,150
Where are you going?

610
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,985
I want to see
how the others are doing.

611
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,737
Make sure you check their IDs.

612
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,863
Okay.

613
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,037
Do you mind

614
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,498
if I check your IDs first?

615
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,499
-Sure.
-Okay.

616
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,295
KIM SO-HUI

617
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,634
I look different, don't I?

618
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,511
I took it
before I got plastic surgery.

619
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,597
There aren't any customers.

620
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,974
None?

621
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,267
-No.
-No.

622
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,228
-Hello?
-Yes?

623
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,606
What would you like?

624
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,776
-One soft tofu stew and...
-Soft tofu stew.

625
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,962
Welcome.

626
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,525
Marketing is important.

627
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,904
But the most important thing
is to stick to the basics.

628
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,033
When you stick to the basics,
your business will never run at a loss.

629
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,829
There's always a reason
behind a successful

630
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,539
and a unsuccessful business.

631
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,916
And that reason

632
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,169
always lies in your business.

633
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,256
Why aren't you taking photos?

634
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,257
Why would she?

635
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,760
She's a huge star on social media.

636
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,012
-She has over 700,000 followers.
-Really?

637
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,682
When I visit a nice place, I take photos
and upload them on social media.

638
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,934
I'm not taking any photos

639
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,019
because this place is lousy.

640
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,771
Yes, I'm not that impressed.

641
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,442
I have a social media account as well.
What's your ID? Let's follow each other.

642
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,829
Stick to the basics.

643
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,081
The basics.

644
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,168
But the place needs to be decent,
to begin with.

645
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,837
A decent pub.

646
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,090
Hey.

647
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,009
What?

648
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,972
What are you doing here on a weekday?

649
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,224
I came to see you
and also for some other stuff.

650
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,477
I'm in charge of our pub in Itaewon now.

651
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,937
I came to take a look.

652
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,400
-We'll see each other often.
-Yes.

653
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,652
Aren't you excited?

654
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,113
Yes.

655
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,328
By the way, you seemed a little dazed.

656
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,746
Is something bothering you?

657
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,331
Oh, that?

658
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,293
I was thinking of what I could do
to improve my pub.

659
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,169
DanBam?

660
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,006
Why?
I think your pub is nice and pleasant.

661
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,465
You have no customers?

662
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,927
We just got our first set of customers.

663
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,472
Apart from the opening month,
we've been running on a deficit.

664
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,396
If you don't mind, can I take a look
at your statement of account?

665
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,566
You might be spending money
on things you don't need.

666
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,194
That's what I learned in school,
so I can take a look at it.

667
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,071
No, that's not what it is.

668
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,283
We have few employees,

669
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,827
and our spending is only
25 percent of our sales.

670
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,871
I'm able to buy good quality ingredients

671
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,165
at a low price
because I know the distributor.

672
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,500
The problem is the rent.

673
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,045
It's only supposed be
ten percent of the sales.

674
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,588
But our pub...

675
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,761
Gosh.

676
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,765
I'm sorry. I know you only wanted to help.

677
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,683
I sounded arrogant, didn't I?

678
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,477
What?

679
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,729
No.

680
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,065
You know a lot of stuff.

681
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,025
Where did you learn that?

682
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,279
I've been dreaming of opening my own pub
for seven years.

683
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,782
I did some research
and studied a few things.

684
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,161
And I constantly read
Chairman Jang's autobiography.

685
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,581
The book made me realize
how incredible he is.

686
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,503
It helped me out a lot.

687
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,010
Should we go now?

688
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,849
Itaewon is a difficult place to succeed.

689
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,769
Why don't you

690
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,605
try opening your pub somewhere else?

691
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,148
No.

692
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,943
I don't know if I told you,

693
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,863
but you haven't changed at all
even after seven years.

694
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,242
The same goes for you.
You haven't changed at all either.

695
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,662
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

696
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,667
I meant you're still pretty.

697
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,380
I was out of style back then.

698
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,049
Don't I look better now?

699
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:24,888
Hey.

700
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,600
They're...

701
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,314
Do you know them?

702
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,861
Actually, no.

703
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,029
I thought I did, but I was mistaken.

704
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,033
I should go back to work now.

705
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,122
Well...

706
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,166
Soo-ah.

707
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,625
Yes?

708
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,297
If you have time after work,

709
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,300
would you like to grab a beer with me?

710
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,013
Okay, sure.

711
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,724
I'll call you later.

712
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,659
We're out of soju now.

713
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,287
Let's get going.
We need to go to school tomorrow.

714
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,749
My gosh, okay. What's the rush?

715
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,835
You came back really quickly.
How are other pubs?

716
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,588
They're all packed.

717
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,677
Park Saeroyi and me.

718
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,680
Whom would you choose?

719
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,572
The same goes for you.
You haven't changed at all either.

720
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,659
Actually,

721
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,662
I've changed quite a lot.

722
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,043
-I'll be in the kitchen.
-Okay.

723
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,838
Hey part-timer, get me some soju.

724
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,218
Did you not hear me?
I want a bottle of soju.

725
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,641
Okay. I'll get you one right away.

726
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,523
-Here.
-Thank you.

727
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,440
Seung-kwon.

728
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,569
Is your name part-timer?

729
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,704
Press the bell. Don't call him like that.

730
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:59,126
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
I guess he's a little drunk.

731
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,754
Please have fun.

732
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,922
I'm sorry.

733
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,843
Are you upset?

734
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,344
It's no big deal.

735
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,305
Hey part-timer, stop right there.

736
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,184
Do you have a problem
with the way I called you?

737
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,646
You're just a part-timer here.
How am I supposed to call you?

738
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,065
Gosh, stop it.
You've been drinking too much.

739
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:26,236
Let go of me. Do you not see
that he's being disrespectful?

740
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,405
Hey.

741
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,616
Is that how your boss taught you?

742
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,369
Wait over there.

743
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,049
I haven't taught him yet.

744
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,801
But I'm the boss here.

745
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,890
And we can treat
nasty customers like that.

746
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:57,976
What?

747
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,270
Don't...

748
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,692
Hey, what did you just say?

749
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,069
Nasty customer?

750
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,821
You have a death wish?

751
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:10,906
Say that again.

752
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,366
-Stop.
-Damn it!

753
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,998
Excuse me. Please don't be like this here.

754
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:20,916
What?

755
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,843
If you want to punch me,

756
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,346
go ahead and do it here, you loser.

757
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,522
My gosh. Hey.

758
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,357
Do you think I can't punch you?

759
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,535
What are you? Why are you breaking in?

760
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,414
I can put up with the whole thing.

761
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,542
But I can't let him get a blow.

762
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,799
I'm really sorry.

763
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,759
We're leaving now.
So--

764
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,344
The jerk punched me first.

765
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,804
What? Jerk?

766
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,348
-Move over.
-I don't need settlement money.

767
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,934
Seong-hyeon!

768
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,604
Seong-hyeon!

769
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,900
Because we punched each other.

770
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,361
Seung-kwon!

771
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,377
Please stop it.

772
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,129
It's over. He passed out.

773
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,672
We will just leave--

774
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,806
Get up.

775
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,487
Lift your head.

776
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:18,617
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

777
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,202
Then you should be punished.

778
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,330
You damn thug!

779
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,753
How dare you make a scene like that?

780
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,633
I told you he would never change.

781
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,761
I'm glad you just found it out.

782
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,596
Just fire him.

783
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,858
I'm sorry.

784
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:57,072
I'll never do it again.
Please let it go this once.

785
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,118
What a psychopath.

786
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:11,711
Hyun-yi,

787
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,839
call 911.

788
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,257
Okay.

789
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:16,925
Excuse me.

790
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,366
I'm sorry.

791
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,952
We can have a date

792
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,706
maybe next time.

793
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,091
We got a report.

794
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,801
But what's all this...

795
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,012
Well...

796
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,016
We had a little spat
with a drunk customer.

797
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,100
I see.

798
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,311
A spat?

799
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,316
Actually, we're here for something else.

800
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:19,196
-Pardon?
-We got a report that a minor is here.

801
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,156
A minor?

802
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:30,373
No. We have only
one group of customers now.

803
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,709
There's no minor in here--

804
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,925
as far as I know.

805
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,933
Excuse me. May I see your ID, please?

806
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,574
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

807
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,620
I know. It's too late. What's the matter?

808
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,956
I got a call from the police
about your brother.

809
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,415
Police?

810
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,417
He went to a pub

811
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,044
and got caught by the police.

812
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:19,506
Chairman wants you to go to your brother.

813
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,508
Damn it.

814
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,927
Wait, Mr. Kim.

815
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,512
Yes?

816
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,348
Do I have a brother?

817
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,231
What a shitty situation.

818
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,400
We did check their ID.

819
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,734
They're the ones who lied.

820
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,653
Why do we have to suffer damage?

821
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,446
Just ask them. Hey.

822
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,156
Didn't we check your ID?

823
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,201
That's enough.
You're here because you hit someone.

824
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,078
Please calm down.

825
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,830
Calm down, my foot.

826
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,541
Do you know how much the rent is?

827
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,043
If we close the place for a week,
we'll go bankrupt.

828
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,005
And what? Two months?
Just because of these shavelings?

829
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,300
He went through a lot to open this pub.

830
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,678
Stop talking to us like that.
I said there would be an investigation.

831
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,805
I'm talking about the usual cases.

832
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,348
We'll deal with it by the law.

833
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,600
What kind of law is that?

834
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,353
My gosh.

835
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,439
Enough.

836
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,568
Don't yell at the officers.

837
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:22,902
But Saeroyi...

838
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,446
You.

839
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,282
Did you really not know?

840
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,664
I left it to you and you took them in
knowingly. What is it then?

841
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,666
It's our fault.

842
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,088
But you didn't do anything wrong.

843
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,096
-I'm sorry.
-Gosh.

844
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,681
So it will be two months?

845
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,309
Yes. I guess that's how it would go.

846
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,310
Wait.

847
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,271
We lied to them.
It shouldn't hurt his business.

848
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,066
What are you raising your voice for?

849
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,776
Stay still until your family comes.

850
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,777
I don't have one.

851
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,446
I'll pay a penalty or take responsibility.

852
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,657
You've got to be kidding me.

853
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,076
You stay quiet too.

854
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,331
-Pardon?
-You can't take responsibility.

855
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,249
That's why you're a minor.

856
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,418
Kiddie.

857
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,551
Let's wrap things up then.

858
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,845
What should we do
to settle the assault case?

859
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,639
Well...
For that...

860
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,849
Hey.

861
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,309
Thank you for your trouble.

862
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,364
Park Saeroyi?

863
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,456
Your brother went to a pub

864
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,999
and got caught by the police.

865
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,553
You're Director Jang.

866
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,888
What brings you here?

867
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,267
Oh, well...

868
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,977
My gosh.

869
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,691
This boy is my family.

870
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,109
What?

871
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,279
Oh, is that so?

872
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,197
And this guy is my friend from school.

873
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,703
Oh, no. He got expelled before graduation.

874
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,371
So we aren't alumni.

875
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:47,088
Gosh, we met again.
What a strange coincidence.

876
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,426
It's nice to see you again, Saeroyi.

877
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,595
What are you doing?

878
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,351
I'm tired. Let's get this over with.

879
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,562
Oh, okay.

880
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,521
Wait.

881
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:05,857
Hang on.

882
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,153
I guess my friend is in trouble
because of my family.

883
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,156
I feel bad about that.

884
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,787
What do you think?

885
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,081
Do you need help?

886
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,670
If he's your friend,

887
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,298
I guess there might be a way.

888
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,885
Please don't worry.

889
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,645
Excuse me?

890
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,276
My dream

891
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,862
was being a cop.

892
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,531
What?

893
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,744
But I lost my temper once
and became an ex-convict.

894
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,455
An ex-convict can't
become a police officer.

895
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,500
I understood it and gave up my dream.

896
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,421
Because the police
are supposed to defend the law.

897
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,426
They must be cleaner
and more righteous than anyone.

898
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,721
That's the police
whom I dreamed of and admired.

899
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,600
But you.

900
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,770
What do you think you're doing?

901
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,607
So what is he?
Is he the president or something?

902
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,654
Why does his word have the power
against police forces?

903
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,741
Well...

904
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,244
Please don't get me wrong.

905
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,579
We're not friends.

906
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,915
-Let's do things by the law.
-Wait.

907
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,210
Saeroyi.

908
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,843
Well...

909
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,358
Excuse me.

910
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,282
Are you out of your mind?

911
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,535
-What?
-Why are you being like this?

912
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,662
What do you mean?

913
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,831
Your business might get suspended.

914
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,416
So what?

915
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,418
I accepted minors.
I should be punished.

916
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,212
But you can avoid it with that guy's help.

917
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,381
He wants to help. What's the problem?

918
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,967
Help?

919
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,178
I'd rather die than get his help.

920
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,974
I see.
So is this about your pride or something?

921
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:49,604
Even if you have to shut down
the business, you want to keep your pride?

922
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,863
What is it?
Why are you getting on my nerves?

923
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,657
I just don't get it.

924
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,285
You need to learn to compromise
when you run a business.

925
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,204
How would you run a business like that?

926
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,750
You told me that I'm nosy
when I don't even know anything.

927
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,503
I don't know anything. I really don't.

928
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,759
-But if you let it slide just this once--
-Just this once?

929
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,807
Just this once? Once and for all?
But there will be another time.

930
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,854
It'll make things easy this once.

931
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,606
But you know what?

932
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,067
That one time

933
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,820
can change your whole life.

934
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,701
What a stuck-up.

935
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,619
What?

936
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,580
Once you're suspended,

937
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,458
there will be no once. It's just over.

938
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,168
Business suspension?

939
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,003
I can just open it again.

940
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,381
It's no big deal.

941
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,346
That's impressive.

942
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,598
It does sound like you, Park Saeroyi.

943
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,434
You haven't changed.

944
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,603
A naive rough-and-tumble amateur.

945
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,774
I understand you though.

946
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,193
You went to prison because of me,

947
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,779
you got expelled from school
because of me,

948
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,161
and you think your dad died
because of me, right?

949
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,498
My gosh.

950
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,836
You know what?

951
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,260
You're right about that.

952
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:54,020
He's a middle school graduate,
an ex-convict, and an orphan.

953
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:57,064
Poor Saeroyi who ruined his life
because of me.

954
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,985
Gosh, I feel so bad for you.

955
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,245
-Jang Geun-won.
-Gosh, you sound scary.

956
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,956
My goodness.

957
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,919
Do you want to punch me?

958
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,420
Like you did before?

959
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,383
Go ahead and do it. You're good at it.

960
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,511
Assault.

961
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,269
Go ahead.

962
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,189
Hit me. Give me a blow.

963
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,191
Punch me. Just do it.

964
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,986
Aren't you going to hit me? Do it.

965
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,280
Go ahead. Hit me.

966
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,412
I guess you've grown up.

967
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,540
Good for you.

968
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,085
You want to make a living
with that tiny store.

969
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,671
You need to be patient, right?

970
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,385
Nine years.

971
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,266
I've been putting up
with it the whole time.

972
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,727
And I'll do it for another six years.

973
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,149
-What are you talking about?
-The statute of limitations.

974
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,492
I have...

975
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,665
a 15-year plan.

976
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,947
He's suffering because of my family again.

977
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,367
I can't wait to see your frowning face
with your business closed down.

978
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,287
You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.

979
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,663
I have to give it a try.

980
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,416
I'll begin with that.
And I'll do everything I want to do.

981
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,126
Ever since I met that guy,

982
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:25,129
I can't seem to find interest
in anything else.

983
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:28,424
Attempted murder? Previous conviction...

984
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,927
If I meddle in here,
does that mean I'm nosy?

985
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,639
Do you like Saeroyi?

986
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,099
His pub is suspended because of you,

987
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,976
but you don't seem sorry at all.

988
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,270
Is it you who called the police?

989
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,278
