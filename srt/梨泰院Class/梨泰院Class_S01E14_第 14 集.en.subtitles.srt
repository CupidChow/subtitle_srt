ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,059
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,603
EPISODE 14

4
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,339
I'm so touched.

5
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,180
-Give it back.
-Why? No.

6
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,765
It's cold.

7
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,112
Why are you sleeping here? Go home.

8
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,743
I fell asleep.

9
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,289
I have a lot of things to prepare for.

10
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,668
-For the buyer in China?
-Yes.

11
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,839
I've taken care of all their requests.

12
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,966
The contract will be renewed
at the next meeting.

13
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,722
You're busy.

14
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,685
What's wrong?

15
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,063
Did something happen?

16
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,069
The old man

17
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,156
is dying?

18
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,327
A shareholder meeting will be held soon
to appoint a new chairman.

19
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,955
He'll want Jang Geun-soo
to be his successor.

20
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,127
So? You want to stop him
from getting appointed?

21
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,671
Our ultimate goal
is Chairman Jang's dismissal.

22
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,590
But how?

23
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:39,052
He's in good terms
with two of the non-executive directors.

24
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,721
Right, Yang Sang-un and Shin U-je.

25
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,516
The board members and the CEO
should never be too close.

26
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,811
As for Mr. Yang, he even manages
Chairman Jang's borrowed-name stocks.

27
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,563
It provides enough grounds.

28
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,524
We'll remove Mr. Yang from the board
and use that

29
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,401
to weaken Chairman Jang.

30
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,987
Will you be all right though?

31
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,991
Didn't you say
Geun-soo used to work at DanBam?

32
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,953
Are you sure
you want to go at him like this?

33
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,291
Mr. Park?

34
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,420
Geun-soo wouldn't expect me to be
that considerate. The same goes for me.

35
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,469
Then who will replace Mr. Yang
after we get him removed?

36
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,556
Saeroyi doesn't qualify
because he's a CEO of a corporation.

37
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,350
Me.

38
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,731
But in most cases,
renowned professors or public officials--

39
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,693
A business management specialist
who can act as an advisor.

40
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,821
And as an inspector who can prevent
the CEO's dogmatic decisions.

41
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,657
Isn't that what the board members do?

42
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,576
That's right.

43
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,954
Named as one of Asia's
power businesswomen by Forbes.

44
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,539
The businesswoman who turned

45
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,874
a tiny pub into the company
that is known as IC Co. today.

46
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,460
That's me.

47
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,715
-That's true.
-Definitely.

48
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,175
It's just that you're too young.

49
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,178
Right, but she'd be perfect for the role.

50
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,389
She's extremely competent.

51
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,017
We've seen what she can do.

52
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,228
Let's go for it.

53
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,608
It'll go well, right?

54
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,945
Yes, there won't be any problems.

55
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,098
I said I support it,

56
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,683
but with the thing in China too...

57
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,018
Can you handle everything?

58
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,022
Do you have time to worry about that?

59
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,817
Well...

60
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,071
If you feel that bad,

61
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,323
grant me a wish.

62
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,825
What's your wish?

63
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,787
Please go on a date with me.

64
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,168
I told you not to cross the line.

65
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,591
It's my wish.

66
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,056
So is Chairman Jang

67
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,017
in the hospital now?

68
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,228
I'm not sure.

69
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,856
There hasn't been anything about it
on the media yet,

70
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,067
but they can't keep it
from the media forever.

71
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,364
People will start talking about it
if he continues to miss work.

72
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,648
There's been an article about
corruption allegations against Mr. Yang.

73
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,108
I read it.

74
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,194
I bet it was Park Saeroyi's doing.

75
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,196
What should we do?

76
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,073
We can't bury this.

77
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,118
I must oust Mr. Yang myself.

78
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,244
The important thing is,

79
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,872
who will take his seat?

80
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,915
As the new non-executive director.

81
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,336
I'll come up with a list of candidates
who are in support of us.

82
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,716
Forget it.

83
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,801
Pardon?

84
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,887
I bet Park Saeroyi

85
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,182
is also thinking of someone
who's in support of him,

86
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,391
so we will

87
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,353
vouch for someone
who meets all the qualifications.

88
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,898
We'll fight fair and square.

89
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,608
Right.

90
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,111
Just one non-executive director
can't affect the voting rights that much.

91
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,949
It'd be better for us to focus
on protecting your public image.

92
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,203
Then proceed accordingly.

93
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,956
You seem to be

94
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,667
doing a little better.

95
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,008
-I'm not sure about that.
-Punished by Heaven?

96
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,885
Who said you can do that?

97
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,095
You should be punished by me.

98
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,556
Don't die just yet.

99
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,396
I feel relieved

100
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,857
for a change.

101
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,075
I've seen this man before.

102
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,493
He and Ms. Kang are close.

103
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,370
I'll set up a meeting.

104
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,248
Him and this man too.

105
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,294
You should take a break.
I'll go over the rest.

106
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:12,677
OH SOO-AH

107
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,603
Hello?

108
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,066
Today?

109
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,532
I'm pretty busy today.
Can we meet another day?

110
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,953
Gosh,
it's practically impossible to see you.

111
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,290
It's all right. I'll see you another time.

112
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,125
But call me, okay?

113
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
All right.

114
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,171
Was that Soo-ah?

115
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,925
Yes.

116
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,720
She wants to meet now?

117
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,187
Someone can't even go on a date
because she has to work all night,

118
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,275
but look at you flirting with a girl
on the phone.

119
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,030
Don't...

120
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,659
do that to me.

121
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,494
What?

122
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,665
Stop doing and saying things
to show that you like me.

123
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,340
I clearly told you
that I don't have any feelings for you.

124
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,471
I know.

125
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,808
Go ahead and meet her.
I was going to do this alone anyway.

126
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,537
Why do I have to feel sorry for you?

127
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,502
What's with you all of a sudden?
I'm fine, so just--

128
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,588
Why do you have to make me feel so uneasy?

129
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,895
Never mind.

130
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,650
Sorry. Just ignore what I just said.
Don't go home too late.

131
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,652
Do you know why you feel that way?

132
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,113
What?

133
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,795
I guess you are starting

134
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,673
to have feelings for me.

135
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,722
-What are you--
-I know you better than anyone.

136
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,520
You finally

137
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,106
think of me as a woman.

138
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,213
We've settled things with the press.

139
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,134
How are we going to retrieve the stocks
that are under Mr. Yang's name?

140
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,761
There's not that much.

141
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,139
Just let him have it.

142
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,933
He can use that to support us.

143
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,562
Yes, sir.

144
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,571
Chairman Jang fired Mr. Yang
without hesitation.

145
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,032
What is he thinking?

146
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,120
Is Yi-seo getting ready?

147
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,789
Ms. Kang is helping her meet people.

148
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,126
To be honest, I'm a little worried.

149
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,586
About what?

150
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,255
We both know how competent she is.

151
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,216
But others will think of her as a kid.

152
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,551
Plus, Jangga Co. tends to be
very conservative.

153
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,097
She'll do well.

154
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,350
How can you be so sure?

155
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,311
It's Yi-seo.

156
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,818
Welcome.

157
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,905
It's nice to meet you all.

158
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,115
You all know her, right?
She's Jo Yi-seo, CFO of IC Co.

159
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,409
-This is--
-President of Sungyoon University.

160
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,579
Business professor at Gwangjin University.
Former bureau chief of TJBC.

161
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,915
Former president of Mingu Bank.
Did I get that right?

162
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,209
It's an honor to meet you all.

163
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,335
Nice to meet you.

164
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,379
She really is clever.

165
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,881
Thank you. Take your seats.

166
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,143
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm Jo Yi-seo.

167
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,521
Hello, I'm President Jo.
It's nice to meet you.

168
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,982
-I'm glad we got to meet today.
-Same here.

169
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,324
Number one. Chicken vegetable tacos.

170
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,870
Number two. Broccoli and chicken wraps.

171
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,955
I look forward to working with you.

172
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,000
-See you at the stockholders' meeting.
-Okay.

173
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,470
How many tables?

174
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,307
I think 14 will do.

175
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,434
Did you make sure to leave some space?

176
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,394
Gosh, of course.

177
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,189
Toni, you're a professional now.

178
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,900
It's been years already.

179
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,069
Yi-seo, your nose is bleeding.

180
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,871
You'll fall ill at this rate.
You should get some rest today.

181
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,460
It's okay. I need to meet
the stockholders soon.

182
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,548
Hey.

183
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,135
Are you ready? Shall we get going?

184
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,471
I just got a call from Mr. Kim.

185
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,474
And he asked for a raincheck
because his wife went into labor.

186
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,143
Really?

187
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,897
It's actually for the better.
You should get some rest today.

188
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,583
Geun-soo?

189
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,003
What are you doing here?

190
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,756
Are you here to meet the stockholders?

191
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,758
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,760
But I beat you to it.

193
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,724
I haven't seen that face in so long.

194
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,476
Have you been well?

195
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,728
Whatever.

196
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,524
The meeting agenda really surprised me.

197
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,443
I didn't know
you would try to take that place.

198
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,363
I heard you worked overseas.

199
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,990
Are you back for the chairman position?

200
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,201
-What?
-Your dad's going to...

201
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,040
I heard he's going to pass away.

202
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,382
Was I too straightforward?

203
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,137
No, I'm just surprised you know already.

204
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,556
Why aren't you using that card?

205
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,019
Well, it's always nice to have
as many cards as I can.

206
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,898
Right.

207
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,776
Are you free?

208
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,278
Why don't we go to Itaewon

209
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,739
and grab a drink?

210
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,743
Why would I drink with you?

211
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,454
Who knows?

212
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,832
I might get drunk
and tell you some company secrets.

213
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,212
It's always nice to have
as many cards as you can.

214
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,103
What's gotten into you?
I'm surprised you called me.

215
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,272
You're busy these days.

216
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,067
I had some free time.

217
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,569
How are you? Is everything the same?

218
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,739
No.

219
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,450
I bought a house.

220
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,161
Really?

221
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,871
That's amazing.

222
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,873
I don't own my own place yet.

223
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,417
Whatever. You're the CEO of IC Co.

224
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,961
It's only because
you spend all your money on stocks.

225
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,176
A nice car, a nice house,

226
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,471
and an independent and relaxed life...

227
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,224
They were my dreams
ever since I was young.

228
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,894
Your dream came true.

229
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
Yes.

230
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,525
I lived really diligently.

231
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,569
But something bothers me.

232
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,824
I feel a bit weird these days.

233
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,910
This is the kind of life
I've always wanted.

234
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,747
But I feel a little empty.

235
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,669
I feel so lethargic.

236
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,761
What about you?

237
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,763
What?

238
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,477
If the stockholders' meeting goes well,

239
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,982
does that mean I'll soon be able
to quit my job?

240
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,744
I guess?

241
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,999
I feel like the end is near.

242
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,422
You're rich, and you're very close
to achieving your goal.

243
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,300
What's next?

244
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,641
Do you still like me?

245
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,109
Why the sudden question?
I've already said it so many times.

246
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,240
Tell me you like me.

247
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,745
What?

248
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,153
Don't go.

249
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,329
Do you like

250
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,999
Yi-seo?

251
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,466
-Soo-ah--
-It's been 15 years.

252
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,762
You...

253
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,391
You promised to make me quit my job.

254
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,729
You of all people

255
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,733
should still like me.

256
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,533
-You--
-You're right.

257
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,414
Everything you said is right, but...

258
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:19,921
I'm sorry.

259
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,929
I was kidding.

260
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,727
Tomorrow's the stockholders' meeting.
You should go talk to her.

261
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,021
Go on.

262
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,027
I'll call you again.

263
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,492
Why are you here?

264
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,498
When are you going to stop

265
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,542
using Yi-seo like that?

266
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,588
What do you mean I'm using her?

267
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,216
You know how she feels.

268
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,718
Are you going to accept it?

269
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,810
You can't accept her feelings,

270
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,479
but you can't push her away.

271
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,023
I understand.

272
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,317
Yi-seo is a very important talent

273
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,695
to IC Co.

274
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,324
-Geun-soo--
-If IC Co. disappears,

275
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,121
will you let go of Yi-seo?

276
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,379
I'll see you at the meeting.

277
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,234
Soo-ah.

278
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,237
Soo-ah.

279
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,077
Geun-won.

280
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,468
I didn't know you got discharged.

281
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,596
Don't you still have
some time left in prison?

282
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,349
I escaped because I missed you.

283
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,643
What?

284
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,311
I'm kidding.

285
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,813
I was a model prisoner.

286
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,024
They let me out early.

287
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,693
It must've been tough.

288
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,203
What's your plan now?

289
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,372
Do you plan

290
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,499
to return to Jangga Co.?

291
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,752
No.

292
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,630
I need to do something else.

293
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,174
Something else?

294
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,180
Come to think of it,
this is our first time drinking together.

295
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,058
We've known each other for years.

296
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,644
I guess today is a special day.

297
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,021
Thanks, Soo-ah.

298
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,232
You made my dream come true.

299
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,901
-Geun-won.
-I know.

300
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,195
I'm not hitting on you.

301
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,450
I know I'm a jerk.

302
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,496
But I don't want to ruin the life
of the woman I like.

303
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,003
What's that supposed to mean?

304
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,174
Nothing.

305
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,678
Do you

306
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,307
still like Saeroyi?

307
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,275
You haven't changed at all.

308
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,946
No.

309
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,160
I guess I'll always be

310
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,122
a horrible jerk to you.

311
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,001
What?

312
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,092
This looks nice. Try a bite.

313
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,480
You're home.

314
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,940
When did you come?

315
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,360
About five days ago.

316
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,030
I was just about to leave.

317
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,534
I'm going on a trip to Europe tomorrow.

318
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,620
I thought I'd drop by before I left.

319
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,041
I'm jealous.

320
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,168
Europe sounds nice.

321
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,005
Why didn't you come home?

322
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,590
Where have you been sleeping?

323
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,224
I was busy.

324
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,353
I went on business trips,

325
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,730
and I sometimes slept in the office.

326
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,983
That's it?

327
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,071
I was hoping things might be
going well with your boss.

328
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,490
I thought you didn't like him.

329
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,283
Well...

330
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,246
Back then, he used to own a small pub.

331
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,997
You're so materialistic.

332
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,167
But I have to say,

333
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,421
nothing happened
between you two for years.

334
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,215
Are you sure you really have a chance?

335
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,009
Yi-seo?

336
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,868
Boss, what are we going to do?

337
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,703
What's the matter?

338
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,706
I think she has a cold or something.
She has a fever.

339
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,335
I'm okay.
Today's the stockholders' meeting.

340
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,588
I don't care if I have a cold. Let's go.

341
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,424
-Will you be okay?
-Yes.

342
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,935
Okay.

343
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,107
Ms. Kang and Ho-jin
will head straight to Jangga Co.

344
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,653
Did they receive a lot of voting rights?

345
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:23,988
-Gosh.
-Yi-seo!

346
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,532
Yi-seo.

347
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,076
I knew this would happen
when she kept overworking herself.

348
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,037
Call an ambulance. Hurry. Yi-seo.

349
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,372
Yi-seo, are you okay?

350
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,759
Yi-seo collapsed.
We're on our way to the hospital.

351
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,802
I'll call you later.

352
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:48,930
What's the matter?

353
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,767
Yi-seo apparently collapsed.

354
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,394
What?

355
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,062
What are we going to do?

356
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,940
She doesn't necessarily need to be there
since she won't be voting.

357
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,527
But what about Saeroyi?
He needs to be there.

358
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,862
Yes.

359
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,155
He's a major shareholder,
so his vote matters.

360
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,991
He needs to be there.

361
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,368
As you already know, he's...

362
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,589
There's an hour left
until the meeting, sir.

363
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,549
Do you feel okay?

364
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,803
Let's go.

365
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,849
JANGGA CO. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ELECTION
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

366
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,113
Long time no see, sir.

367
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,535
Yes.

368
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,788
I didn't know you were involved.

369
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,874
But then again,

370
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,793
you were never the obedient type

371
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,296
ever since you were young.

372
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,549
I heard about

373
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,718
your severe condition.

374
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,351
I'm sure it would've been a nice card.

375
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,770
But you didn't use it against me.

376
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,399
Because what matters to me is Jangga Co.

377
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,904
Yes, you're trying to invite an executive
from outside the company

378
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,573
instead of going public about my health.

379
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,869
And I'm sure you're doing all that
for the company.

380
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,329
I have no doubt about that.

381
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,914
-Sir--
-But the problem is,

382
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,751
you always make the wrong choice.

383
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,548
That punk is motivated by revenge,
so you should've discarded him by now.

384
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,969
You don't keep that kind of person on top.

385
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,351
Where is Saeroyi?

386
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,939
There he is.

387
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,736
What about Yi-seo?
Didn't she come with you?

388
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,657
She's not coming today.

389
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,911
How do you think it'll go today?

390
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,247
You heard what the chairman said.

391
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,040
You always

392
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,043
make the wrong choice, Ms. Kang.

393
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,295
What?

394
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,842
I'll see you later.

395
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,596
That rude little punk.

396
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,310
How is Yi-seo? Is she okay?

397
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,138
We will begin the stockholders’ meeting
regarding the appointment

398
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,766
of Ms. Jo Yi-seo as
a non-executive director.

399
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,024
-Yi-seo!
-Yi-seo.

400
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,821
How do you think it'll go?

401
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,032
How would I know?

402
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,367
I don't know how things work
with this kind of stuff.

403
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,163
So you don't care if we win or not?

404
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,332
Don't take it so negatively.

405
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,250
She worked so hard,
so it'd be great if we win.

406
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,586
But I just want her

407
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,506
to take a break once in a while.

408
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,021
The stockholders' meeting.

409
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,691
How did it go?

410
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,029
The proposal to appoint Ms. Jo Yi-seo
as a non-executive director

411
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,249
has been rejected.

412
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,795
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ELECTION
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

413
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,605
Our foreign branches?

414
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,568
If we gather the stockholders in the US,
that already exceeds ten percent.

415
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,696
But no one really has authority over them.
We should be more attentive.

416
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,074
So you're going to bring them to our side?

417
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,201
VOICE RECORDING

418
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,621
Don't worry, Director Jang.

419
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,375
They know we're going to partner up
with All Food Market in LA.

420
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:13,129
So over 70 percent of the US stockholders
will give you their support.

421
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,403
Like I said,

422
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,907
I can't wait for too long.

423
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,889
Today, let's focus
on calming the stockholders.

424
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,099
Saeroyi, cheer up.

425
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,313
Ms. Kang, I need to go to the hospital.

426
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,106
What? Oh, yes.

427
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,608
What do you mean? We--

428
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,859
Don't worry. You should go.

429
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,995
LIA NATIONAL HOSPITAL

430
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,707
Hey, over here.

431
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,750
-Is she in here?
-Yes.

432
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,672
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

433
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,216
I was busy running.

434
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,010
-How did it go?
-What about you? Are you okay?

435
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,929
She overworked herself.

436
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,723
Don't worry too much.
She'll be fine after she gets some rest.

437
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
Tell me how it went.

438
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,230
It got rejected.

439
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,318
Are you really okay?

440
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,697
I bet it was Geun-soo's doing.

441
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,116
He recently went to the overseas branches.

442
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,368
I guess he convinced
the stockholders there.

443
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,912
That cunning fox.

444
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,541
Don't worry.

445
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,460
-I have plan B.
-For now, you should--

446
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,630
I've been meeting
with the stockholders and directors.

447
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,299
What are you doing now?

448
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,011
A lot of them had complaints
even though they didn't speak out.

449
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,180
I will stir them all
with Chairman Jang's cancer.

450
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,975
Stop it.

451
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,813
Get some rest.

452
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,066
What are you talking about? I can't rest.

453
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,609
If you keep moving,

454
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,864
you'll be fired.

455
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,369
You guys watch Yi-seo.

456
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,413
If she moves, tell me immediately.

457
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,833
I'll just fire her.

458
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,836
Okay.

459
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,049
-Boss--
-Please.

460
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,884
Get some rest.

461
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,802
I'm begging you.

462
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,484
Boss.

463
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,238
Why are you here?
I told you to watch Yi-seo.

464
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,990
Hyun-yi is there.

465
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,117
I will look around the stores
instead of Yi-seo.

466
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,162
Okay.

467
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,751
Why do you look so down?

468
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,087
Is it because of the meeting?

469
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,380
Or is it about

470
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,006
Yi-seo?

471
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,592
What?

472
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,554
Things will go better
at the next stockholders' meeting.

473
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,639
And about Yi-seo,

474
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,225
you can just go after your heart.

475
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,063
What are you trying to say?

476
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,273
You know what I mean.

477
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,526
Yi-seo has feelings for you.

478
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,445
And you like Soo-ah.

479
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,035
Are you confused?

480
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,790
You're being silly.

481
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,334
The age gap between Yi-seo and I...

482
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,463
Work, age gap, and all that.

483
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,841
They are just excuses.

484
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,676
If you don't like me,

485
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,512
that's just what it is.

486
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,518
Do you really need

487
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,478
excuses like that?

488
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,773
What about age?

489
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,526
It doesn't matter
even if people point fingers at you.

490
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,194
Your first love from ten years ago?

491
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,530
It's okay to hurt her feelings.

492
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,909
Why are you being so talkative?

493
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,036
I'm just saying.

494
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,331
This is really not like you.

495
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,418
I should get going then.

496
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,920
-See you.
-Bye.

497
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,212
Look at this necklace.

498
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,546
Isn't it so pretty?

499
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,105
I don't think he really meant it.

500
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,108
He just said
that because he cares about you.

501
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,111
No, I know that look on his face.

502
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,073
If I moved there,
I would've been fired right away.

503
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,202
It's all about timing.

504
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,248
This is not the time
for me to lie in bed like this.

505
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,459
Hyun-yi.

506
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,962
Will you cover up for me?

507
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,506
Gosh, no. I'd end up getting fired too.

508
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,174
What? Whose side are you on?

509
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,718
Don't be silly.
Of course, I'm on your side.

510
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,184
Saeroyi will take
care of the business in China.

511
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,020
And Seung-kwon will
take care of the stores.

512
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,773
Can't you trust them?

513
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,275
It's not like that.

514
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,986
Seung-kwon is better than me

515
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,905
when it comes to the stores.

516
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,491
Then why are you trying
to overwork yourself?

517
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,827
These days,

518
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,871
I keep telling Boss

519
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,332
that I love him.

520
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,129
That's not surprising.

521
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,716
If he thinks my feelings for him
are a reason for dismissal,

522
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,511
he should fire me, I said.

523
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,388
What's that?

524
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,473
The company can't run without you.

525
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,142
That's it.

526
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,645
The reason

527
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,565
I can show my affection like that

528
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,069
is because I am a competent employee

529
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,697
who's needed in the company.

530
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,493
Whatever I say,

531
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,455
he needs to have me around him.

532
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,709
I have to be someone who he needs.

533
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,220
You fool.

534
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,514
Do you think he will fire you
if you are not good?

535
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,974
Would Saeroyi do that?

536
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,187
You've worked with him for years.
Do you still not know him?

537
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,480
I know.

538
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,609
I just need to justify my actions.

539
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,530
I need the right to say

540
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,408
that I love him.

541
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:02,074
I will be too busy to take care
of Jangmun Market Street for a while.

542
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,245
You are the only person
whom I can ask for a favor.

543
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,248
I should do as I'm told by the director.

544
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,416
Thank you.

545
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:15,379
By the way, things are a little
uneasy in the company these days.

546
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,758
The next chairman will be announced soon.

547
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,052
The next chairman?

548
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,262
Well...

549
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,765
I guess you should know that.

550
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,393
What's the matter?

551
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,313
Chairman Jang

552
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,527
has only a few months to live.

553
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,166
Geun-soo, that fool.

554
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,626
He didn't have to tell you.

555
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,797
I was going to tell you anyway.

556
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,635
Besides Mr. Kim,

557
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,764
you're the one who stayed with me
for the longest time.

558
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,270
But you had a different motive.

559
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:22,738
I know how you've felt
around me the whole time.

560
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,784
You resented me

561
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,704
for what happened to Mr. Park.

562
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,791
But you were afraid of me
at the same time.

563
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,046
Yes.

564
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,715
That's true.

565
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,386
Someone you hate is dying.

566
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,224
Isn't it a good thing?

567
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,769
Why

568
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,813
are you crying?

569
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,110
I don't know.

570
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,324
You fool.

571
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,953
I know

572
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,123
I've given you hard times with my orders.

573
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,210
You're a competent woman,

574
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,754
but you didn't leave your boss
whom you hate.

575
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,465
Do you know why?

576
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,302
I don't know.

577
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,390
It's servility.

578
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,935
You've been tamed

579
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,397
to my taste.

580
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,443
I pressured everyone around me

581
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,573
with power to tame them like that.

582
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,411
It's easy

583
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,289
to control them.

584
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,834
And I despise them.

585
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,883
Is that how you want me to feel about you

586
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,471
at the last moment of my life?

587
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,518
Why are you

588
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,356
telling me all that?

589
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,404
I don't know.

590
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,871
I'm literally close to death.

591
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,250
So I guess I'm being strange.

592
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,146
He's waiting.

593
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,526
Sir, your customer is here.

594
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,577
Gosh, welcome.

595
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,415
It's been a long time.

596
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,126
What we talked about before.

597
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,296
I'd like to start it.

598
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,849
When do we start?

599
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,567
Mr. Park, it's been a while.

600
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,737
Toni, why did you bring them?

601
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,573
Yi-seo is sick, so Seung-kwon called me.

602
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,827
That's a lot.

603
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,453
This is about half of it.

604
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,664
Yi-seo's drawer is locked,

605
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,499
so I didn't bring the files for China.

606
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,127
I don't know the password.
Shall I call her?

607
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,296
No. I know it. I'll take care of it.

608
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,261
Why are you lying down here?

609
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,929
I need to sign the proposals.

610
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,472
I'm doing this for Yi-seo.

611
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,101
It's locked.

612
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,352
I know the password.

613
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,271
Good. All the important
documents are in there.

614
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,272
What's the password?

615
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,525
What?

616
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,860
The password.

617
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,448
My birthday.

618
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,661
Gosh, she's so devoted.

619
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,167
What's the proposal for?

620
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,127
It's no big deal. It's about an event.

621
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,336
An event?

622
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,964
All right.

623
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,009
"With the person at DanBam".

624
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,720
"Whom do you hate the most this winter?"

625
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,347
"Come to DanBam with the person."

626
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,475
"You'll get free Ugly Duck Bulgogi."

627
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,769
What's that?

628
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,438
We will hear their stories
and give out free dishes.

629
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:10,066
"Who's the first person
you want to thank?"

630
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,443
A person I want to thank?

631
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,944
For me,

632
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,404
of course, it's you.

633
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,039
Someone I'm grateful to?

634
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:26,917
Boss.

635
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,461
Boss, I recorded everything.

636
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:33,715
I recorded that bastard confessing
the murder of your father.

637
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,636
If we use this and involve the media,
the police may reinvestigate the case.

638
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,561
"Who's the first person
you want to apologize to?"

639
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,481
Don't like me.

640
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,374
"When was the scariest moment
that comes to your mind now?"

641
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,627
Yi-seo!

642
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,045
Yi-seo.

643
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,508
"What's the best luck in your life?"

644
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,387
I want to

645
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,514
work here.

646
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,476
I will

647
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,020
help you achieve your dream, Boss.

648
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,443
"Are you

649
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,905
in love with someone?"

650
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,464
It's

651
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,843
all you.

652
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:02,322
The reason
I can show my affection like that

653
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,616
is because I am a competent employee

654
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,494
who's needed in the company.

655
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,332
Whatever I say,

656
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,626
he needs to have me around him.

657
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,381
I have to be someone who he needs.

658
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,320
Jo Yi-seo. Where is she?

659
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,780
What's your relationship with her?

660
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,323
Her friend.

661
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,283
Jo Yi-seo...

662
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,872
She refused to see anyone
other than family and authorized people.

663
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,416
What?

664
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,377
If you're a friend,
you should give her a call.

665
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,670
Well...

666
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,839
Geun-soo.

667
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,713
GET BETTER, FROM SAEROYI

668
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,881
Get better.

669
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,393
-Ms. Jo Yi-seo.
-Yes?

670
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,604
I'll get you an IV injection.

671
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,521
Okay.

672
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,195
About the non-executive director issue.

673
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,156
Is it okay if I don't feel bad about it?

674
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,491
Sure.

675
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,578
You totally got us.

676
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:14,788
I guess

677
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,123
you just did your job.

678
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,046
I knew you would say that.

679
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,839
Did you read articles about Yi-seo?

680
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,384
Yes.

681
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,596
And the next thing I know,

682
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:32,764
I'm here.

683
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,810
Do you

684
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,063
still like Yi-seo a lot?

685
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,487
It's been four years.

686
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,365
I've thought about her every single day.

687
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,325
You know it.

688
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,705
The reason I left DanBam.

689
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,960
The reason I want to take over Jangga Co.

690
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,505
The reason

691
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,551
I want to destroy IC Co.

692
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,387
It's all

693
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,893
because of Yi-seo.

694
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,275
I understand.

695
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,822
She's someone
whom you can bet your life on.

696
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:32,991
Yi-seo.

697
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,539
What?

698
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,211
She's a woman my friend loves.

699
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,591
I should give up
even if I have feelings for her.

700
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,553
A woman?

701
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,222
It's a betrayal.

702
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,977
It's an awful thing to do.

703
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,901
Saeroyi.

704
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,710
I'm doing it now.

705
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,090
The betrayal.

706
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,468
The awful thing.

707
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,766
-What are you--
-You can curse at me if you want.

708
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,186
-If you punch me, I'll let you do it.
-What are you talking about?

709
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,778
I

710
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,574
like Yi-seo.

711
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,624
I won't apologize though.

712
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,352
PATIENT JO Y SEO

713
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,645
Yi-seo.

714
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,506
Damn it!

715
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,515
You said you never had feelings for her.

716
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,267
Why did you change your mind?

717
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,560
What about Ms. Oh?

718
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,937
EUNMA-RO 29GIL PAJIN CITY
DON'T CALL ANYONE AND COME ALONE

719
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,063
Yi-seo.

720
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,148
What is going on?

721
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,888
Gosh, that was quick.

722
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,849
Where's Yi-seo?

723
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,353
What's going on?

724
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,106
Where's Yi-seo? Why isn't she in her room?

725
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,691
You...

726
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,824
I feel so bad for my dad.

727
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,185
Jang Geun-won.

728
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,692
The two guys I hate are here together.

729
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,070
Where's Yi-seo?

730
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,239
I don't know.

731
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,409
Why do you even care
when you're about to die?

732
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,788
Where's Yi-seo, you idiot?

733
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,076
Saeroyi!

734
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,919
Saeroyi!

735
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,965
Follow my heart

736
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,760
and be myself.

737
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,890
A life without regrets

738
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,267
regardless of consequences.

739
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,440
That's how I wanted to live.

740
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,330
Have I been committed?

741
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,222
Now

742
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,183
I regret

743
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,485
that day a lot.

744
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,668
Right now, I...

745
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,423
I love you.

746
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,137
I love you, Boss.

747
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,182
I love you.

748
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,728
I really love you.

749
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,618
I miss you like crazy.

750
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,420
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE?
BRING THEM TO DANBAM

751
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,030
