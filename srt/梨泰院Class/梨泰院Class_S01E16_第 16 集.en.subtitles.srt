1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,848
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,349
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,649
Saeroyi.

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,751
You

5
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,797
brought me to my knees.

6
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,022
Why are you being like this?

7
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,859
Your beliefs and ambition.
Where did they all go?

8
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,616
This was enough
to bring you to your knees?

9
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,915
After all, you're surrendering
to my power.

10
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,340
Where is Jang Geun-won?

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,226
I was looking forward to this last bit
of entertainment.

12
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,982
How disappointing.

13
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,237
You're truly pathetic.

14
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,161
But because you got down
on those pathetic knees,

15
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,833
I have no choice
but to desert my son once again.

16
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,289
You're kneeling before me, your enemy.

17
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,791
Tell me.

18
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,669
How does it feel?

19
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,677
I feel pathetic.

20
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,388
You do?

21
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,436
-You may leave.
-How do you feel now, sir?

22
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,444
You brought me to my knees.

23
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,696
Are you happy?

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,416
Is this gratifying for you?

25
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,170
-Are you--
-Wanting

26
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,299
to get back at you
kept me going until now.

27
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,473
Jang Dae-hee, the chairman of Jangga Co.

28
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,433
My enemy.

29
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,230
You made my life hell.
But at the same time,

30
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,275
you were an inspiring man.

31
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,198
I had to admit that
despite our different values.

32
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:44,993
I devoted

33
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,039
my whole life

34
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,542
to follow in your footsteps.

35
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,089
I thought

36
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,844
this fight was worth it.

37
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,222
-Hold on--
-But that man

38
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,183
threatened me

39
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,021
to kneel before him
by holding my close ones hostage.

40
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,320
I wasted over a decade of my life
following in the footsteps

41
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,738
of a disgusting old grouch?

42
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,285
I deeply regret

43
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,415
wasting my life.

44
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,378
Look at the outcome.

45
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,131
You kneeled down before me.

46
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,633
To get what you want--

47
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,305
Let's go, Seung-kwon.

48
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,681
Okay.

49
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,415
After over a decade,

50
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,834
I got to know you.

51
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,272
THE FINAL EPISODE

52
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
All right.

53
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,984
Forget about Park Saeroyi.

54
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,071
I want you to die, Jo Yi-seo.

55
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,761
Don't waste your energy and stay still.

56
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,474
Pick it up.

57
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,778
Gosh, I'm terrified.

58
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,696
Why?

59
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,866
Do you want to fight against us?

60
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,910
You guys are funny.

61
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,372
Attack them as I count to three.

62
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,876
Come on.

63
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,085
One.

64
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,421
Two, three.

65
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,632
Good luck, Jang Geun-soo! Hang in there!

66
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,642
-Go get her.
-Yes, Boss.

67
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,603
Damn it!

68
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,605
Don't you dare come close to me.

69
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,111
What are you doing?

70
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,739
She told me

71
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,617
to hang on.

72
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,593
You know it will be dangerous.

73
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,264
I will

74
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,267
save Yi-seo.

75
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,812
I know. That's why we're going there.

76
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,733
You should also choose your priority.

77
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,319
What?

78
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,321
Things will go haywire

79
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,698
if you fail to make a decision.

80
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,450
Even if

81
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,329
we both get hurt

82
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,291
or die, my priority is to save Yi-seo.

83
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,295
Is that so?

84
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,800
But I can't force you to do the same.

85
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,638
My gosh, then why did you ask me
to come with you?

86
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,934
Yi-seo

87
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,770
may be a rude brat.

88
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,565
But she's family now.

89
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,109
I also care about her.

90
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,570
We should have the same goal

91
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,822
for better teamwork.

92
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,451
Thank you.

93
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,995
No problem.

94
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,332
By the way,
I'm going to save Yi-seo even if you die.

95
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,148
Are you okay?

96
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,234
I bet you've never been stabbed.

97
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,656
It's useless to act brave
like those guys you see in movies.

98
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,408
This is the reality.

99
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,210
You really are tough.

100
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,838
Hold on tight.

101
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,138
That's enough.

102
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,808
What about Yi-seo?

103
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,019
You'll lose her.

104
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,149
You're right.

105
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,028
Start the car.

106
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,002
You got everything you want
including Jangga Co.

107
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,588
Just stay out of this.

108
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:17,968
Everything I want?

109
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,559
Throughout my entire life, I never got

110
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,521
what I wanted.

111
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:36,654
But I have to say,

112
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,367
I guess we really are brothers.

113
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,330
What?

114
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,458
We always used

115
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,170
the wrong method.

116
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,761
What is he doing? Aren't you coming?

117
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,307
Keep him here.

118
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,303
Hey!

119
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,221
Give up already!

120
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,557
You can't run away!

121
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,310
You give up, you fucking loser!

122
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,191
-Go get her.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,283
My gosh.

124
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,577
She's unbelievable.

125
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,235
My gosh.

126
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,921
Run into it.

127
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,709
The airbags work nicely.

128
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,419
This car is amazing.

129
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,256
My gosh.

130
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,841
What is all this?

131
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,594
My gosh.

132
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,599
Boss?

133
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,686
Yi-seo.

134
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,649
Boss...

135
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,943
Boss!

136
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,294
Are you okay?

137
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,839
I heard you got hurt.

138
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,261
What in the world are you doing here?
Have you lost your mind?

139
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,181
Saeroyi!

140
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,190
You saved me some time.

141
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,277
You came here to die, right?

142
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,280
Saeroyi.

143
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,117
Hee-hoon.

144
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,204
You should've stayed at the hospital.

145
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,625
I called the cops before I came here.

146
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,296
Can you please just leave?

147
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,549
-You fucking coward.
-Gosh, it hurts.

148
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,929
You asshole.

149
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,641
Seung-kwon, are you okay?

150
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,187
Ms. Jo, it's nice to hear you
call me by my name.

151
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,897
Seung-kwon.

152
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,775
Yes, I know my priorities.

153
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,448
Hurry up and get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

154
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,246
Let's go.

155
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,501
That little...

156
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,007
Choi Seung-kwon.

157
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,727
Finish him.

158
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,779
My gosh, you used to be one of us.

159
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,573
But you're ruthless.

160
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,117
"Don't hesitate."

161
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,037
That's what you always used to say.

162
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,956
I have to say,

163
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,126
-you're better off with us.
-No.

164
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,839
I'm better at serving tables.

165
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,831
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

166
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,250
Why did you come here?

167
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,710
Come here.

168
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,050
This reminds me of that day

169
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,511
when we ran like crazy in Itaewon.

170
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,847
Why are you suddenly talking about that?

171
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,434
I missed you so much.

172
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,531
You always

173
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,409
worked so hard for me

174
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,121
and got hurt.

175
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,793
What's going on?

176
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,630
Are you sure you're okay?

177
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,594
I can't believe this.

178
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,062
My mind

179
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,733
and heart

180
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,868
are filled with you.

181
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,919
Is this how you felt?

182
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,715
This is very nerve racking.

183
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,552
Boss.

184
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,469
I love you.

185
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,102
I love you, Yi-seo.

186
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,777
I love you so much.

187
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,344
Those crazy psychos.

188
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,870
Go. Run.

189
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,289
I can't leave without you.

190
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,083
Are you trying to die alone?

191
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,337
The cops will call you.

192
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,756
Answer the phone
and tell them where we are.

193
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,180
You guys are having fun, aren't you?

194
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,476
Trust me and just go.

195
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,771
Yi-seo.

196
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,776
What a fucking joke.

197
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,861
If you die,

198
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,114
I'll die too.

199
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,616
Go on. Hurry.

200
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,202
Hey!

201
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,172
Damn it.

202
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,804
You want to die, right?

203
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,349
Both Seung-kwon and I put our lives
on the line.

204
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,979
Your life means nothing to me.

205
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,857
Crazy bastard.

206
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,782
Boss! You fucking asshole!

207
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,663
What now, you bastard?

208
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,681
Today,

209
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,144
it all ends.

210
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,281
You fucking bastard.

211
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,496
Die!

212
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,874
Die just like your father!

213
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,508
How can you still call yourself human?

214
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,984
Yi-seo, Geun-soo, Ho-jin,

215
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,028
and my dad.

216
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,117
Do you feel no guilt at all?

217
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,871
Do you feel guilty

218
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,998
when you eat livestock?

219
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,792
What?

220
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,211
Because of you livestock,

221
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,922
I lost everything.

222
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,882
"Guilt"?

223
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,926
Cut the bullshit.

224
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,929
-You fucking asshole!
-Shut up, you jerk!

225
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,691
Die, you piece of shit!

226
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,609
Just die already!

227
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,694
Stop. Wait.

228
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,490
I can't beat you.

229
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,534
I lost.

230
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,249
Saeroyi offered me a way out,

231
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,334
so let me just leave quietly.

232
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,634
What about your guys?

233
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,846
What about them?

234
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,140
Look at me.

235
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,059
I can't even take care of myself.

236
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,937
I'll leave them here for now--

237
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,855
Stop.

238
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,110
Don't say another word.

239
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,367
You're starting to make me regret

240
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,913
having worked for you.

241
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,084
A true boss

242
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,254
is someone who takes responsibility.

243
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,720
Die!

244
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,347
Go to hell!

245
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,132
Wait. Over there. Please pull over.

246
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,215
Just die, you zombie.

247
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,973
I'm no longer the man I used to be.

248
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,270
Just remember one thing.

249
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,398
If you die,

250
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,567
I'll die too.

251
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,322
I can't let it happen.

252
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,074
I can feel it.

253
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,119
What crap are you saying?

254
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,789
I think

255
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,834
I will be happy.

256
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,379
That's not going to happen.

257
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,094
Damn it!

258
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,265
Damn, what was that?

259
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,061
It's okay.

260
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,678
I sometimes wonder

261
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,681
if there's really any point in living.

262
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,017
Life is just so pointless

263
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,602
and obvious.

264
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,854
What do you mean?

265
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,402
We all grow old and die one day
before we even turn 100.

266
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,781
But we all try so hard
to live a decent life.

267
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,703
It would've been nice
if I was never born in the first place.

268
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,414
It feels like a chore.

269
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,167
If it feels like such a chore,

270
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,379
just die.

271
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,090
What?

272
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,633
I guess you're not that clever.

273
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,511
You talk as if you're some kind of a god.

274
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,143
Every night after work,
I go for a run in the neighborhood.

275
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,021
And when I wake up tomorrow,
I'll open the restaurant

276
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,691
and spend the day working there again.

277
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,820
Your life might seem repetitive.

278
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,032
But no one really knows
what could happen tomorrow.

279
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,288
Seung-kwon once tried
to start a fight with me,

280
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,166
but now he's a waiter at DanBam.

281
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,961
You made my pub get suspended,
but now you're the manager.

282
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,381
Not a single day was predictable for me.

283
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:24,637
Some days were tough,
and some days were sad.

284
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:30,185
But something fun always came along
every once in a while.

285
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,065
It's been happening more often
ever since you came.

286
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,653
Every day is full of excitement.

287
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,535
Who knows?

288
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,287
One day,

289
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,917
your boring life might turn
into an exciting one.

290
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,465
It's cold. Let's go.

291
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,302
Me too.

292
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,643
When I'm with you,

293
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,270
my heart beats

294
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,648
and it's fun.

295
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,494
I did it.

296
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,748
It's all done now.

297
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,229
Boss!

298
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,361
You are okay...

299
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:07,991
Let's be...

300
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,418
Let's be happy.

301
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,608
PROSECUTION

302
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,620
The prosecution carried out
a thorough search of Jangga Co.

303
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,997
for bribery, embezzlement,
and slush fund creation.

304
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,543
Chairman Jang Dae-hee is forbidden
from leaving the country.

305
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,964
And he will be summoned
for investigation within this week.

306
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:51,094
Based on the seized data
from the offices of Jangga Co.,

307
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,180
the prosecution will focus
on grasping the size and flow

308
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,058
of the embezzlement and slush fund.

309
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,478
A connection with gangsters.

310
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,856
Incitement to commit murder. Kidnapping.

311
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,735
Also, Ms. Oh blew the whistle

312
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:54,240
and disclosed the embezzlement,
bribery, and other irregularities.

313
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,662
There's going to be a search and seizure.
There's no way out of this.

314
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,208
I think

315
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,336
you'll also have to attend.

316
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,050
I'll take the blame for everything.

317
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,054
Anything else?

318
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,559
Mr. Kim.

319
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,440
The pub owners

320
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,612
wish to cancel the contract
and receive compensation--

321
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,946
The Olympics will be soon.

322
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,909
We just need to wait until then.

323
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,036
We are on the brink of bankruptcy.

324
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,792
And the board is considering the option
of selling the company.

325
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,628
What?

326
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,006
What are you talking about?
If we sell now,

327
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,014
we'll gain absolutely nothing.
Have they lost their minds?

328
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,185
There's one firm that offered to take over

329
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,063
at a reasonable price.

330
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,280
CHUNGCHEONG PRISON

331
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:24,664
LET'S BUILD MORALITY
AND LIVE HEALTHY LIVES

332
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,004
You seem familiar.

333
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,799
I'm Lee Ho-jin.

334
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,385
"Lee Ho-jin"?

335
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,264
I'm a financial manager for IC Co.

336
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,893
I used to be the financial manager
for Director Kang.

337
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,187
And before that,

338
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,441
a senior in class one at Gwangjin High.

339
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,111
You bullied me.

340
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,160
What...

341
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,787
That nerd?

342
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,248
How could you forget me?

343
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,835
The whole thing with you and Saeroyi
started with me.

344
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,421
You...

345
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,505
Did you--

346
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,215
And I get to wrap things up too.

347
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,302
What are you talking about?

348
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,347
There will be a takeover bid
for Jangga Co.

349
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,310
Takeover?

350
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,314
Those days you don't even remember...

351
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,775
"Jang Geun-won is the law."

352
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,321
You could say that
as Jangga Co. had your back.

353
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,283
I wanted to see you
without your background.

354
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,494
All of Chairman Jang's corruption
is revealed.

355
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,954
He will soon be arrested.

356
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,666
How dare you...

357
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,387
Stop whining.

358
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,933
You...

359
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,934
It's done.

360
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,481
I forgive you.

361
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,486
Hey, Lee Ho-jin.

362
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,905
You moron.

363
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,698
Lee Ho-jin!

364
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,325
You idiot!

365
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,618
Damn it!

366
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,661
Hey!

367
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:30,039
Let go of me. Lee Ho-jin!

368
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,585
Min-jung.

369
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,213
Hey.

370
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,926
Where are you going?

371
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,094
Seoul.

372
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,845
To take care of something...

373
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,723
I'm going back to the head office.

374
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,351
I see. That's a bummer.

375
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,560
Right?

376
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,273
I won't

377
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,983
get to see you often then.

378
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,194
That depends on you.

379
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,822
You can visit me when you come to Seoul.

380
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,746
How could I do that?

381
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,625
You can't?

382
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,836
Then you won't get to see me.

383
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,755
You are so lame.

384
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,759
I'll see you later, Hye-won. Bye.

385
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,927
Bye!

386
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,222
Well...

387
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,016
Director Kang.

388
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,853
You're not my employee.
Why do you call me like that?

389
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,063
You can call me by my name.

390
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,940
Okay.

391
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,567
Ms. Min-jung.

392
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,943
My goodness.

393
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,948
What was that? It's funny, isn't it?

394
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,784
Can I

395
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,454
give you a ride?

396
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,873
She'll be a lot more comfortable
in that car.

397
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,166
Stay quiet.

398
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,376
The truck is too small for three people.

399
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,170
Well...

400
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,347
I will just squeeze in.

401
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,101
You go on ahead. I'll go with that truck.

402
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,061
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:17,813
Let's go.

404
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,190
Please get in.

405
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,789
JANGGA PUB, JANGGA NOODLES,
JANGGA RESTAURANT

406
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,082
A whistleblower.

407
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,543
No one would want to hire you.

408
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,047
Why did you do that?

409
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,842
What about you?

410
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,221
Why do you try so hard

411
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,890
for Jangga Co. and Chairman Jang?

412
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,684
You don't know why?

413
00:39:58,854 --> 00:39:59,688
I'm

414
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,608
a salaryman.

415
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,574
I've learned a lot from you.

416
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,219
There's no way

417
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,638
that little brat can run Jangga Co.

418
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,516
Please help me this once.

419
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,394
Mr. Hwang.

420
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,859
What about the Mayor?

421
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,695
I can't reach him.

422
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,031
These old bats.

423
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,035
Only six months ago,
they were intimidated by me.

424
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,495
Damn it.

425
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,873
There is

426
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,500
nothing we can do now.

427
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,171
-Are you saying--
-Chairman Jang.

428
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:06,839
I mean,

429
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,092
Dad.

430
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,265
You know your favorite saying.

431
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,060
"The strong prey on the weak."

432
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,230
It's just like that.

433
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,941
We got weak,

434
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,153
so we are now prey.

435
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:39,955
Get out.

436
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,107
That's ridiculous.

437
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,152
I'm Jang Dae-hee.

438
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,321
This is Jangga Co.

439
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,156
No.

440
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,367
It can never happen.

441
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,953
Does this make sense to you?

442
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,205
An ex-convict
who barely finished middle school?

443
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,040
I tried to put up with all that.

444
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,458
Mom, please.

445
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,711
And now what? Kidnap? She got kidnapped?

446
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,298
I'm really sorry.

447
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,804
I knew it all along when he stopped you
from going to college.

448
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,516
How would I trust you with my daughter
when you're like this?

449
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:45,437
I'm really sorry. I'll make sure
it will never happen again.

450
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,147
You have to.

451
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,442
I will watch you closely.

452
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,361
Make sure to take good care of her.

453
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,196
Sure. I will take...

454
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:58,951
Yes, ma'am.

455
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,416
Mom. We have to go. You should go.

456
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,252
Okay.

457
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,213
All right then. I hope you'll get better.

458
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,381
See you.

459
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,925
Thank you, Mother. Take care.

460
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,432
"Mother"?

461
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:25,936
Yes.

462
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,776
It's nice to hear.

463
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,903
Go, Mom.

464
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:36,989
Bye.

465
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,663
Wait, my legs.

466
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,210
I clearly heard you say
you'd take care of me.

467
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,128
What?

468
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,595
You know I'm not just a talker.

469
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,349
What?

470
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,437
Do you like me?

471
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,734
No, I love you.

472
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,826
Let's go.

473
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,456
What? I didn't hear you. Say it again.

474
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,666
Say what?

475
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,918
What you just said.

476
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,798
I love you. Let's go.

477
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,716
I love you too.

478
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,600
Didn't I tell you I'm upset with you?

479
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,726
I know.

480
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,814
I did get on your nerves

481
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,983
because of Park Saeroyi.

482
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,487
Like you asked, I promise

483
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,615
I won't mess with him again.

484
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,161
Let me get this straight.

485
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,123
It's not that you won't mess with him.

486
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,750
You just can't do it anymore.

487
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,880
We've known each other

488
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,216
for over 40 years.

489
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,759
Why did you call me?

490
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,763
I don't know if you're aware of it,

491
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,893
but I don't have long to live.

492
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,862
I could build Jangga Co.
into a major company thanks to you.

493
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,406
I can't ruin it just like this.

494
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,533
If you give me one more chance--

495
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,201
You built Jangga Co. thanks to me?

496
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,121
You told me this before.

497
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:53,333
You started your business
to feed your family.

498
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,296
Do you still feel the same way?

499
00:45:58,964 --> 00:45:59,798
Sure.

500
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,383
I really do.

501
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,676
Then let me ask you.

502
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,721
If Park Saeroyi leads Jangga Co.,

503
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,307
will your family starve to death?

504
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,727
Why do you

505
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,021
run your business now?

506
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,197
I've never made you suffer a loss.

507
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,408
If you help me this once--

508
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,367
For you,

509
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,080
we've been together for mutual advantages.

510
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,250
It just goes away

511
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,836
once you lose your value.

512
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,633
Please don't be like this.

513
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,052
What should I do now?

514
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,346
It can't be helped.

515
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,309
I'm not the one
you should be clinging on to.

516
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,812
-Ms. Kim.
-There's someone else

517
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,314
who can take care of things.

518
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,160
DANBAM

519
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,268
Welcome to DanBam.

520
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:49,491
Who is he that Mr. Park would come
all the way here to serve him food?

521
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,410
I know. Ms. Jo is here too.

522
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,495
He looks really familiar.

523
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,618
Soft tofu stew?

524
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,537
Please try it.

525
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,060
I'm pursuing the takeover of Jangga Co.

526
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,822
I'm planning to let Director Kang
run the company.

527
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,367
Since its reputation is tarnished,

528
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,496
and I have hard feelings toward its name,

529
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,249
I'm going to change it.

530
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,718
This stew.

531
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:15,512
Where did you learn it?

532
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,517
From my father.

533
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,603
Mr. Park?

534
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,154
I thought it tasted similar.

535
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,365
But this one has a unique aftertaste.

536
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,869
We have our own recipe for the sauce.

537
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,245
I give

538
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,665
a lot of care to fermented soybean powder.

539
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,001
A lot of care?

540
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,379
On a cold day,

541
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,591
the warmth spreads throughout the body.

542
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,468
Isn't it good?

543
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,484
I agree.

544
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:22,788
I got treated with a nice meal like this.

545
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,540
But I'm sorry

546
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,794
I didn't bring any money.

547
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,177
This is embarrassing.

548
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,100
Can I pay in another way?

549
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,059
What are you doing?

550
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,775
Jangga Co. is collapsing already.

551
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,279
There would be no advantage

552
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,032
in taking over the company.

553
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,828
This is all my fault.

554
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,249
This isn't just about resentment.

555
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,795
Jangga Co. is a good company.

556
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,138
I don't have many days to live.

557
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,725
I'm not doing this for my own good.

558
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,272
I apologize with all my heart.

559
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,362
I've done terrible things

560
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,075
to Mr. Park and you.

561
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,327
I'm deeply sorry.

562
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,681
Please forgive me.

563
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,326
I've always wanted this to happen,

564
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,162
but it doesn't feel great.

565
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,637
I feel bad for Geun-soo.

566
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,016
Please get up.

567
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,275
Saeroyi.

568
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,828
Do you think

569
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,212
I'm a pushover?

570
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,258
What?

571
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,805
I'm

572
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,599
a businessman.

573
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,358
What value would your apology have
after losing everything,

574
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,319
when a business takeover is on the line?

575
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,624
Let's do business,

576
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,001
Chairman Jang.

577
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,651
The IC Co. will take over

578
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,362
Jangga Co.

579
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,365
Then, Mr. Park,
please say something for us.

580
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:25,668
THE 32ND SHAREHOLDERS MEETING
OF JANGGA CO.

581
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,214
JANGGA CO.

582
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,563
Hello, I'm Park Saeroyi, CEO of IC Co.

583
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,611
Jangga Co. is a restaurant company
representing Korea.

584
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,365
There is a menu that represents Jangga Co.

585
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,536
Gochujang seasoned pork bulgogi
and its seasoning.

586
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,457
A country in crisis,
the time when everyone was in trouble,

587
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:08,169
this comforted the people
with its low price and delicious taste.

588
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,174
The recent events
have cracked the corporate image

589
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,593
because of one individual.

590
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,846
But Jangga Co. is still a good restaurant.

591
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,850
At that time,
it was not only money and gain

592
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,145
that Jangga Co. sought after.

593
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,482
The most important things in business.

594
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:30,942
People.

595
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,569
Trust.

596
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,072
I will value people more than money.

597
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,534
I will value trust over gains.

598
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,912
With all of you,

599
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:47,542
we will renew and prosper again.

600
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:48,793
Thank you.

601
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,785
Congratulations on your accomplishment.

602
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,995
Thank you.

603
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,246
Congratulations.

604
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,456
Congratulations.

605
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:29,959
Geun-soo.

606
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,596
I heard you resigned.

607
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,558
A defeated soldier must retreat.

608
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,605
It might have been uncomfortable today
but you voted for me.

609
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:52,857
Why did you do that?

610
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,277
Does my vote even matter?

611
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,738
I just...

612
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,366
I wanted to see it.

613
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,912
You achieving your goal.

614
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,376
I will not harm you
for your father's deeds.

615
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,046
-One day with your abilities--
-It was me.

616
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,510
I told the reporters

617
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,430
about Hyun-yi.

618
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,443
In addition to that,

619
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,073
I approached Seung-kwon

620
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,659
to figure out IC's movements.

621
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,789
It didn't suit me.

622
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,171
I did everything I could to win.

623
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,592
I knew from the beginning

624
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,763
that I wouldn't be able to get Yi-seo

625
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,850
even if I took over Jangga Co.

626
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,065
I knew everything but I couldn't stop.

627
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,112
I didn't know how to stop.

628
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,247
My heart...

629
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,249
It's okay.

630
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,881
Because you are a kiddie.

631
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,802
Come to eat sometime.

632
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,704
OH SOO-AH

633
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,333
Hello.

634
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,921
I heard. I wanted to congratulate you.

635
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,132
A whistleblower.

636
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:25,343
Why did you do it?

637
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,387
It's not because of you.

638
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,349
What?

639
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:33,935
When I borrowed money

640
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,480
for college from your dad,

641
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,900
I told him I would pay him threefold.

642
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,196
Do you think

643
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,241
this was enough?

644
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,454
Yes.

645
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:55,581
Thank you.

646
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,881
Now I can comfortably

647
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,759
live my life.

648
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:12,890
As a friend,

649
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,142
can you cheer for me?

650
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,442
I always cheer for you.

651
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,204
Now that your revenge is over,

652
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,749
can I ask you a favor?

653
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:41,752
What is it?

654
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,884
Live

655
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,344
happily.

656
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:58,603
I will.

657
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,358
DANBAM

658
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:54,408
Do you want me to come with you?

659
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,038
What?

660
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,415
What are you doing here?

661
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,042
Geun-soo called me here.

662
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,210
-You too?
-Yes.

663
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:05,878
Hello.

664
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,422
Why is he so depressed?

665
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,926
He got dumped by his girlfriend.

666
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,596
Hey, it's no big deal.

667
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,723
Do you know how I feel?

668
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,225
You don't have a girlfriend.

669
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,187
He's right. You don't.

670
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,400
What is this?

671
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,484
Movie tickets?

672
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,779
You can take it.

673
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,739
I don't need it anymore.

674
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,950
Gosh, Toni.

675
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,412
What?

676
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:58,472
Hey.

677
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,474
Did he just speak English?

678
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,226
Yes, he learned it.

679
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:04,145
That was his homework from our boss.

680
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,522
What? It's Geun-soo.

681
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,744
Please forgive me.

682
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,206
Raise your head.

683
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,635
You stabbed us in the back,
so we're paying you back.

684
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,932
Did you hit him hard?

685
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,809
Did I?

686
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,021
Hey, are you...

687
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,486
I guess I didn't hit him right.

688
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,197
Why did you do such a thing

689
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,074
when you would feel bad about it?

690
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,410
I'm sorry.

691
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,332
Yi-seo is coming today.
Make sure to see her before you leave.

692
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:11,712
Maybe next time.

693
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,923
I'll see her later.

694
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,133
Why don't you stay here and see her?

695
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:19,220
I'm

696
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,722
still a kiddie.

697
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,379
What are you doing here?

698
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:55,256
Well...

699
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,718
I'm going to the States.

700
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,182
I wanted to apologize
to Seung-kwon and Hyun-yi before I leave.

701
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,564
Do you feel better this way?

702
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,818
Saying sorry won't just cut it.

703
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:21,407
I know.

704
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:24,285
Bye.

705
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:25,870
Take care.

706
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:31,667
Yi-seo.

707
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,636
What about a handshake?

708
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,642
Is it something like an ending

709
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,811
of your long crush?

710
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,397
Well...

711
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:57,610
I know.

712
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,987
I don't deserve it.

713
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,037
Of course,

714
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,206
you do.

715
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,045
You didn't even care
about right and wrong.

716
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,298
You were faithful to me.

717
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,468
I couldn't accept it,

718
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,429
but I could feel it all.

719
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,351
I'm sorry I took advantage of it.

720
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:33,854
And thank you.

721
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,332
Take care.

722
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:43,924
-Is this it?
-Yes.

723
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,885
This place is popular these days.
I'm here to spy on it.

724
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,891
You don't have to spy on me.
Just ask me if you have questions.

725
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,479
-The owner is pretty.
-Oh...

726
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,148
Is this yours?

727
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,110
I recently opened it
with Seok-cheon's investment.

728
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:05,446
Go ahead and spy.

729
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,823
Come on in. I'll buy you some tea.

730
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,285
You know what?

731
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,707
Boss and I are dating.

732
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,054
I'm relieved if it's you.

733
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,017
Take good care of Saeroyi.

734
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,522
What? How nosy.

735
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,232
Why do you even care?

736
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,068
-Let's just go, Hyun-yi.
-Hey.

737
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,240
I'll come again next time.

738
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,493
Hey, wait for me.

739
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,374
I mean it.

740
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,627
Take good care of him.

741
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,132
-That's so...
-Seok-cheon.

742
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,093
Soo-ah.

743
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,346
A chef is here for an interview.

744
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,223
Oh, right. Where is he?

745
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,140
He's there.

746
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,070
Hello.

747
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,579
Amazing.

748
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,082
Sorry?

749
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,250
You have to hire him.

750
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,544
He's stunning.

751
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,005
Wow.

752
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,007
How could a chef look like that?

753
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,801
He should be serving in the hall.

754
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,469
You'll hire him, right?

755
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,014
I'll hire him only if he cooks well.

756
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:10,612
Please say you like it.
You have to hire him.

757
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,161
Do you like it?

758
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:28,714
Can you start tomorrow?

759
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,556
Yes, Boss.

760
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,852
I'll come here starting from tomorrow.

761
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,354
I love it.

762
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:46,273
It's delicious.

763
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,193
Wow, this is amazing.

764
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,117
What was that?

765
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,495
You startled me.

766
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,788
Why did you call me? I'm busy.

767
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,624
No reason.

768
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,918
I got free tickets.

769
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,337
I didn't want to watch it alone.

770
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,967
I guess Director Choi has
a lot of free time these days.

771
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,512
It's not like I can sell these tickets.

772
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,684
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

773
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:25,812
I'm coming.

774
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:27,147
Gosh.

775
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,027
Gosh.

776
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,445
Hello.

777
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,715
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

778
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,100
What are you doing here?

779
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:09,773
Are you busy?

780
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,401
Why? Is something wrong?

781
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:18,740
Not really.

782
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,951
A cool breeze is blowing outside.

783
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,829
It's a nice day for a walk.

784
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,790
If you're not busy, can we go out?

785
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,212
I'm not busy.

786
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:36,091
MR. PARK'S SCHEDULE

787
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,304
I haven't been in Itaewon with you
in such a long time.

788
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,098
I know. We've been busy.

789
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:48,812
-Boss.
-Yes?

790
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:49,813
Come here.

791
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:51,857
-Okay.
-This is nice.

792
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,241
One, two, three.

793
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,125
-Should I take one?
-No.

794
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,043
No?

795
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,753
Take a picture of me.

796
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:20,552
-You said you love me, right?
-What? Yes.

797
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,222
I did.

798
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,854
But why do you not hold my hand?

799
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,652
Oh, well...

800
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,571
It's just...

801
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,575
It feels a little awkward.

802
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:48,747
I feel the same way.

803
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,656
I'll try my best.

804
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:33,500
You and I are different from A to Z.

805
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,211
But we have one thing in common.

806
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,215
One thing in common?

807
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:42,676
Yes.

808
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,265
We don't know the warmth of people.

809
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:55,981
When I heard

810
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,860
about your past the other day,

811
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,907
I wanted to embrace

812
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,661
all your painful past.

813
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,708
I didn't want you to suffer

814
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:18,920
and to be lonely.

815
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,304
I wanted to make

816
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,475
your bitter night sweet.

817
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,487
When I think of you,

818
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,699
my empty life

819
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,163
fills up with you.

820
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:02,214
Thank you.

821
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,514
I love you.

822
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,311
I will make you happy.

823
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,797
I wanted to be happy.

824
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,343
Without losing myself,

825
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,180
I wanted to achieve everything I want.

826
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,645
There were difficult days.

827
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:04,734
Sometimes,

828
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,947
I was nervous and afraid.

829
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,749
How did I get through all that?

830
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:21,877
We can...

831
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,253
-Do it!
-Do it!

832
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,255
With my loved ones,

833
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:29,217
I've led a hectic life
doing what I want to do.

834
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,261
-We got this!
-We got this!

835
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:33,930
Staying with them.

836
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,057
Sharing my life

837
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:38,727
with them.

838
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,608
In search of happiness.

839
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,917
I love you,

840
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,420
Yi-seo.

841
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,536
Happiness.

842
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,384
The warmth I share with you.

843
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:27,669
I'm already

844
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,808
happier than I ever imagined

845
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:47,188
I could be.

846
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:15,717
Boss,

847
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:17,969
I love you.

848
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,265
Let's drink.

849
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,310
Cheers!

850
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,030
Who wants to go clubbing?

851
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,198
How does it taste?

852
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,922
AN END-CREDIT SCENE WILL FOLLOW

853
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,500
I work as usual.

854
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,172
And I date

855
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:20,258
as usual.

856
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:28,766
What was that?

857
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:32,896
I just like you.

858
01:26:35,398 --> 01:26:37,233
I guess you like me just a little.

859
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,354
That's not true.

860
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,044
A usual day.

861
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:47,387
DANBAM
