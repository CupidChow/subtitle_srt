1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,640
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,934
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,237
Is this working?

4
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,908
Hi, everyone. Let me introduce DanBam
on Gyeongridan-gil Road.

5
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,952
Ta-da. Hyun-yi, say hi.

6
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,288
-Are we on live again? Hi!
-Hi!

7
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,499
SHE ALREADY LOOKS SO PRETTY

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,793
YI-SEO, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR JACKET?

9
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,295
Let me introduce my boss. Boss!

10
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,549
-Hi! Say hi. I'm live-streaming.
-Oh!

11
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,926
YOU TWO SHOULD DATE

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,761
Yes, hello.

13
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,181
Boss, how do you feel now
that DanBam is on Gyeongridan-gil Road?

14
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,349
NEED A PART-TIMER?

15
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,059
How do I feel? What do I say?

16
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,227
Just say anything.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,728
YOU'RE CUTE

18
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,439
-We'll work hard.
-Gosh. "We'll work hard."

19
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,817
My boss is so boring.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,068
THAT WAS CUTE

21
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,904
Then what are your goals as the boss?
Share with us.

22
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,489
-My goals?
-Yes.

23
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,324
GOSH, HE'S NO FUN

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,493
I GUESS HE'S NEVER DONE
LIVE STREAMING BEFORE

25
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,370
WE'LL FORGIVE HIM BECAUSE HE'S HANDSOME

26
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,412
-Come on.
-Okay.

27
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,706
DANBAM? DO THEY HAVE GOOD FOOD?

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,083
My staff and I...

29
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,835
THEY REOPENED ON GYEONGRIDAN ROAD

30
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,378
...will work hard

31
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,257
to make DanBam
the number one pub in the country.

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,174
Wow.

33
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,968
-Number one.
-Number one.

34
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,970
-Shall we shout together?
-Okay.

35
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,805
One, two, three.

36
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,390
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,563
EPISODE 9

38
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,605
Last but not least...

39
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,152
There are more than five million
business owners in the country.

40
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,445
And out of those,

41
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,657
a million businesses shut down every year.

42
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,993
Why do they go out of business?

43
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,037
Because the economy is bad?
No.

44
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,959
It's because customers don't have a reason
to choose it over the other ones.

45
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,087
Your foods, decor, and system
must set you apart.

46
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,630
If you open one without a plan

47
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,466
or putting much thought into it,
you'll fail.

48
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,511
Outdo your neighboring businesses.

49
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,097
Have something unique that sets you apart.

50
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,517
Figure out how you can win the competition

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,144
and keep trying things.

52
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,980
I was able to grow Jangga Co.
from the tiny pub

53
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,316
forty years ago to what it is today

54
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,111
because I ceaselessly pondered solutions,
and I'll never stop.

55
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,531
All these concerns and attempts

56
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,409
are what got me to where I am today.

57
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,495
You can

58
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
do it, too.

59
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,963
Thank you for listening
to this businessman, Jang Dae-hee.

60
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,341
SEMINAR BY CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

61
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,729
I'm sorry.
We're not accepting any questions--

62
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,358
BUSINESS

63
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,442
Give her a microphone.

64
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,160
Hello, sir. I enjoyed the seminar.

65
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,330
We've met before.
It's good to see you again.

66
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm curious to hear your question.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,003
Well, my boss always says

68
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,797
that business is all about people.

69
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,134
This has nothing to do with the seminar.
I'm purely asking as a fan of yours.

70
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,473
Do you also have such a motto
about running a business?

71
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,851
"Business is all about people"?

72
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,562
He's quite a hopeless romantic.

73
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,068
Let me think.
What does running a business mean to me?

74
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,739
No matter what word you use
to sugarcoat it,

75
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,658
you can't change its definition.

76
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,495
The ultimate goal of a business
is to obtain profits.

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,417
You said you grew a tiny pub
under a bridge

78
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,752
into what Jangga Co. is today.

79
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,630
I truly admire you.

80
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,925
And I loved that you used the word,
"competition."

81
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,761
Then I want to ask you
about competition.

82
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,014
Do you think it's possible

83
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,976
for a small pub
to beat what Jangga Co. is today?

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,327
I love seeing ambitious young people
like yourself,

85
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,122
but I'm still full of ambition as well,

86
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,796
so such a thing will never happen
until the day I die.

87
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,596
With that bold statement,
I'd like to end this seminar.

88
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,852
Thank you for attending our seminar
hosted by Chairman Jang Dae-hee.

89
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,251
I didn't think
I'd see you at this seminar.

90
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,545
Was it helpful?

91
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,548
Yes. I learned a lot, sir.

92
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,511
I heard you moved to Gyeongridan-gil Road.
How's business?

93
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,139
We're working hard, but it's not easy.

94
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,476
I see. Keep up the good work.

95
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,396
Goodbye, sir.

96
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,949
In my opinion, power comes from people.

97
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,537
Because their trust gives me strength.

98
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,205
If your business fails,

99
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,791
you'll lose your people.

100
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,169
They're the reason why I can continue
to run my business.

101
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,714
Right.

102
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,218
Mr. Kim.

103
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,512
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,519
Ms. Jo.

105
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,486
Chairman Jang would like to see you.

106
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,080
Chairman Jang,
the guest you're expecting is here.

107
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,748
Okay, let her in.

108
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,042
You were expecting someone?

109
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,065
You're...

110
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,611
Thanks for coming.

111
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,113
Have you eaten yet?

112
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,074
No, not yet.

113
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,409
Shall we eat first?

114
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,553
This was so good.

115
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,680
Thank you, sir.

116
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,598
My pleasure.

117
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,273
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

118
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,110
Why don't you join Jangga Co.?

119
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,988
I'll treat you well.

120
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,830
Thank you for the offer,

121
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,416
but I'm afraid I must decline.

122
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,711
May I ask why?

123
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,589
Because of my boss.

124
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,391
I know young people these days
value friendship a great deal,

125
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,643
but it hasn't even been a year.

126
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,979
It's only a shallow friendship.

127
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,649
Like you said,

128
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,819
I shouldn't decline your offer
merely because of friendship.

129
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,698
But aren't you making this offer
because of my boss?

130
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,204
You're immensely interested
in my boss as well as in DanBam.

131
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,206
So?

132
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,588
I'm confident that I can grow DanBam.

133
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,716
If you come to notice me,

134
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,385
not my boss, in that process,

135
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,347
you can give me
this offer again then, sir.

136
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,457
Jo Yi-seo.

137
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,127
The manager of Park Saeroyi's pub.

138
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,881
Park Saeroyi, that prick.

139
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,716
Because of Mr. Park.

140
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,594
He was like a father to me.

141
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,284
Damn it.

142
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,999
Jeez, you need to look ahead
when you're driving.

143
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,756
Hey, you can't drive at full speed here.

144
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,262
Goddamnit.

145
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,769
Shall I call my insurer
or just give you money?

146
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,481
-What?
-Just answer my question. I'm busy.

147
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,774
Jeez, what the...

148
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,652
First, you need to apologize to me
for hitting my car.

149
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,404
Are you that rich?

150
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,325
Will you say no to money
if I apologize to you?

151
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,412
I am rich.

152
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm offering you money!

153
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,331
What the hell.

154
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,171
Here.

155
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,094
How's the pub going?

156
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,473
Not bad. Yi-seo has done some marketing.

157
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,978
"Not bad" is an understatement.
We should get ready for the tax season.

158
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,524
How much will I be taxed?

159
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,695
Well, I can't really figure out
the exact amount yet.

160
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,530
But at this rate, a lot.

161
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,658
What should I do?

162
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,829
You don't need to worry.
It's my specialty, you know.

163
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,707
I've got an idea.

164
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,584
I'm going to incorporate DanBam.

165
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,919
PARK SAEROYI

166
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,671
You'll incorporate DanBam?
So it'll become a company?

167
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,174
Wow, that means you'll be a CEO.

168
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,260
CEO? What does it mean
to incorporate the business?

169
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,678
Incorporate DanBam...

170
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,681
With all the money we're pulling in,
we should. For tax purposes.

171
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,309
So we need to come up with a name.

172
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,395
A company name. Throw some ideas.

173
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,815
"Parkga."

174
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,525
What do you think?

175
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,404
No, it sounds like knockoff of Jangga Co.

176
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,198
What about "ILL"?

177
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,034
I think it sounds cool.

178
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,411
Yi-seo, Royi, love.

179
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,707
Not sure. I don't love it.

180
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,293
What about you, Seung-kwon? Got any ideas?

181
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,670
Well...

182
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,047
"Itaewon...

183
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,757
Class"?

184
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,343
Gosh, what is that?

185
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
It sounds so lame.

186
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,388
It sounds so uncool, just like him.

187
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,682
I actually like it.

188
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,767
Right? I like it too.

189
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,894
"Itaewon Class."

190
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,648
It's catchy. It's a good name.
You guys don't like it?

191
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,234
No, I don't.

192
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,445
"Class," seriously? It sounds so childish.

193
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,906
It sounds like something
a teenage bluffer would say.

194
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,033
DANBAM PUB GROUP CHAT

195
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,337
SEOMSEOM PUB

196
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,050
ITAEWON

197
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,278
The first word that came to my mind
when I heard "Itaewon Class"

198
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,655
was "freedom."

199
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,535
A place where different cultures
can mingle freely.

200
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,662
Being free from restraints.

201
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,124
Itaewon symbolizes freedom.

202
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,878
That's what you were going for, right?

203
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,131
Yes.

204
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,133
Bullshit.

205
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,135
It sounds a little forced,

206
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,304
but it's not bad.

207
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,389
It's got that old-school vibe.

208
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,559
What can we do?

209
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,311
You already love the name.

210
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,146
You'll go with it anyway.

211
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,565
No.

212
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,901
I won't if you don't like it.

213
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,239
Well...

214
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,368
I'm fine with it if you like it.

215
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,203
It's fine,

216
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,164
but limiting ourselves to Itaewon only
won't help us

217
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,999
when dealing with other businesses.

218
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,250
It makes us look small.

219
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,547
Then "Itaewon Class" can be a name
that we use amongst ourselves.

220
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,675
How about we use the initials?

221
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,889
"IC"?

222
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,766
"IC"?

223
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,269
-"IC."
-What?

224
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,732
Wow, using English.

225
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,777
Nice. It's a memorable name.

226
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,113
"IC."

227
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,158
I like it.

228
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,787
Then since the manager likes it too,

229
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,249
we're now the founding members of IC Inc.,

230
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,587
Itaewon Class.

231
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,466
DANBAM

232
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,304
DANBAM

233
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,852
Saeroyi!

234
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,646
Hey, Hye-won.

235
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,606
Hello.

236
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,775
It's her school anniversary,
so I brought her.

237
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,152
It's good to see you.

238
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,196
Guys, help him with his stuff.

239
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
-Sure.
-Sure.

240
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,200
-It's your first time here, right?
-Yes.

241
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,120
Hi, Yi-seo.

242
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,582
I'm hungry.

243
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,624
Give me some food.

244
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,542
You're hungry?

245
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,920
-Hyun-yi, can you make some food for her?
-Oh, sure.

246
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,465
-Hey, take this.
-You bring it.

247
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,382
That little...

248
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,427
Have a seat here.
It'll be ready soon.

249
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,344
Okay.

250
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,972
Boss, I'm going to go check the order.

251
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,682
All right.

252
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,895
Saeroyi, spare me a moment.

253
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,981
Wait here.

254
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,279
DANBAM

255
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,448
How's business?

256
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,533
It's going pretty well.

257
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,495
But not as well as when we were
in Itaewon.

258
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,371
It's hard to run a pub in an alley.

259
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,124
I was very surprised.

260
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,002
You were able to relocate
and buy this building.

261
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,463
How did you save so much money?

262
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,883
I have a friend
who's a great fund manager.

263
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,594
-I'll introduce you to him next time.
-All right.

264
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,973
Well, you see...

265
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,686
What's the matter?

266
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,733
Well, about the thing we talked about
last time...

267
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,821
Hold on.

268
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,281
Where did Hye-won go?

269
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,201
Hye-won.

270
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,078
Hye-won.

271
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,663
Hye-won?

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,835
Hye-won!

273
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,421
Hye-won!

274
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,006
Did you guys see Hye-won?

275
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,342
No, we were busy checking this.
Did she leave?

276
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,179
-Geun-soo, go this way with Toni.
-Okay. Hey, Toni.

277
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,807
Yi-seo, you stay here. Let's go this way.

278
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,393
Hye-won!

279
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,687
Hye-won!

280
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,110
Why isn't Saeroyi picking up?

281
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,236
Ma'am.

282
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,408
Me?

283
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,035
I got lost while following a cat.

284
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,288
I didn't bring my phone.

285
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,373
May I please borrow your phone?

286
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,419
Don't call me "Ma'am."

287
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,130
You seem to be
around the same age as my dad.

288
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,382
But I'm not married.

289
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
Really?

290
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,511
But you're pretty.

291
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,930
Why aren't you married?

292
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,641
Just make your phone call.

293
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,687
Dad, I'm sorry.

294
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,149
I got lost,
so I'm using someone else's phone now.

295
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,109
Here?

296
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,528
I don't agree with that.

297
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,783
Come on. Tell me their names.

298
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,244
-Kim Ji-eun and--
-Hye-won!

299
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:09,917
My gosh.

300
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,044
Dad, I can't breathe.

301
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,546
-Ms. Kang.
-Hey.

302
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,882
Why did you leave without even telling me?

303
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,426
Sorry, Dad. You must've been worried.

304
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,385
Yes, of course!

305
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,512
This lady here helped me.

306
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,518
-Thank you.
-No problem.

307
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,479
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

308
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,731
She's adorable.
I had a fun chat with her.

309
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,859
He's our supplier,
and this is his daughter.

310
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,194
I see.

311
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,072
Were you on your way to meet me?

312
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,449
-Yes, I'd love to check out your pub.
-Okay.

313
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,701
Let's talk there.

314
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,955
Sorry again, Dad.

315
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,086
-Hye-won.
-Yes?

316
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,629
Go with Saeroyi.

317
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,966
I have to make an important phone call.
I'll meet you at the pub.

318
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,763
ITAEWON CHILDREN'S PARK

319
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,932
Who are you?

320
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,980
-Let go, you bastard!
-You punk!

321
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,939
Hey!

322
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,331
Did your dad learn martial arts?

323
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,376
My dad used to be a cop. He's very strong.

324
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,213
He's so dependable.

325
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,385
He's single too.

326
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,762
What?

327
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,438
What's going on?

328
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,780
I only see photos from today.

329
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,284
He probably deletes them daily.

330
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,121
He's keeping track of where you go,

331
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,582
who you meet, and what you do.

332
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,334
Everything you do...

333
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,090
What's wrong? Did you find anything?

334
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,176
No, it's not that.

335
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,096
Anyway, I wonder
who ordered him to do this.

336
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,681
Chairman Jang.

337
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,142
Yes.

338
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,770
He's the only one
who'd do something like this.

339
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,356
This means that he may know
about our partnership.

340
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,283
Right, I should thank you
for all your help earlier.

341
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,702
Gosh, no problem at all.

342
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,288
Your daughter is so smart.
You raised her well.

343
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,751
Thankfully, she doesn't take after me.

344
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,462
But you raised her.

345
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,259
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

346
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
She kept bragging about you.

347
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,848
It sounded like you're a great dad.

348
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,607
Hye-won,

349
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,692
we should go home.
Say bye to everyone.

350
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,614
See you soon, Ms. Kang and Saeroyi.

351
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,283
-Be a good girl.
-I will.

352
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,744
-Well, take care.
-You too.

353
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,663
Detective Oh.

354
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,459
Weren't you going
to say something earlier?

355
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,586
Oh, that...

356
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,925
I'll tell you later. Another time.

357
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,178
I'll be waiting.

358
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,362
It's doing pretty well.

359
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,656
There are a few interesting things.

360
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,491
They took care of the renovation

361
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,577
and inspected the entire process
themselves.

362
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,079
The space is over 40 pyeong,

363
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,499
yet they only spent 25 million won,
including the demolition cost.

364
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,711
It sounds like you've seen the space.

365
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,255
Yes, I have.

366
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,758
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

367
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,428
They opened a live channel
and posted the entire process,

368
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,180
from looking for a store space

369
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,807
to the renovations and the inspections.

370
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,268
It's very popular
among small business owners

371
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,646
and young customers who are foodies.

372
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,817
Let me introduce
the part-timers at DanBam.

373
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,361
The face of DanBam.

374
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,404
Jang Geun-soo!

375
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,406
HANDSOME

376
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,909
I'm Jang Geun-soo, a server.

377
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,202
Hi, Geun-soo.

378
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,745
What's your hobby?

379
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,871
-My hobby?
-Yes.

380
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,291
I'm good at spinning soju bottles.

381
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,128
-I see. That's his hobby.
-I'll show you.

382
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,963
-Like this.
-Gosh.

383
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,550
What about--

384
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,638
Mr. Kim is waiting, sir.

385
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:15,889
Let him in.

386
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,565
I'll come back another time.

387
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,567
It's okay. What is it?

388
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,490
I make great soju bombs.

389
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,618
Then do you make soju bombs for customers?

390
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,412
Yes, of course. That's a given.

391
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,457
Everyone, visit DanBam
for the awesome soju bombs--

392
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,424
Ms. Kang found out
that we've been tailing her.

393
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,932
-I'll be off, then.
-No, stay.

394
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,730
-But she doesn't know that you--
-I'm sure she knows.

395
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,359
Who else would be that interested
in Min-jung?

396
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,360
It doesn't matter.

397
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,656
More importantly, that girl, Yi-seo...

398
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,909
We're reviewing the position
and pay scale.

399
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,412
I'll approach her with an offer
when it's finalized.

400
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,664
Good. You must bring her on board.

401
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,710
-Sir.
-She must've won him over.

402
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,264
If you come to notice me, not my boss,
in that process,

403
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,891
you can give me
this offer again then, sir.

404
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,689
She's interesting.

405
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,108
Pardon me?

406
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,486
She doesn't suit that punk, Park Saeroyi.

407
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,655
She's like me.

408
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,662
-What about other stuff?
-Well,

409
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,125
all their ingredients are supplied
by Hyewon Foods.

410
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,337
They use good ingredients.
I've never heard of it though.

411
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,881
The owner is an ex-cop. Maybe that's why.

412
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,507
Everyone says that he's thorough.

413
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,134
He's an ex-cop?

414
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,595
He left the police about ten years ago

415
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,889
and started a produce supply business.

416
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,183
The thing is though,
it is based in Pajin

417
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,226
and he mostly does business in the area.

418
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,729
But he supplies produce to DanBam
that's an hour away,

419
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,856
so I think they have
a personal relationship.

420
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,068
Pajin?

421
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,615
Maybe he knew Mr. Park.

422
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,121
Set up a meeting with him.
I'd like to meet him myself.

423
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,085
What on earth is going on?

424
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,380
Tailing Ms. Kang? And what's
with Yi-seo and the supplier?

425
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,464
You heard everything.

426
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,425
Why would we go to such lengths
to take down that small--

427
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,343
Ms. Oh.

428
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,430
Is your opinion necessary?

429
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,725
-Sorry?
-We're mere employees,

430
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,976
so we just need to do

431
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,145
as the chairman says.

432
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,653
What's going on?

433
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,490
Are you two fighting?

434
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,034
I'm off.

435
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,331
What's with her?

436
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,458
It's nothing, sir.

437
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,629
How's Dad? Is he doing all right?

438
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,880
Yes, sir.

439
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,592
Take good care of him.
He's been a little sensitive lately.

440
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,054
If my dad needs something,

441
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,432
you should also let me know.

442
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,688
Sir.

443
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,992
He seems to like Jo Yi-seo,
the young lady who works at DanBam.

444
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,745
This could be your chance
to win his trust.

445
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,957
Why don't you take charge
and convince her to work with us?

446
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,550
What did I tell you?

447
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,343
Business in the alley is tough.

448
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,387
It's even harder when it's a pub.

449
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,806
The borough office parking lot
closes at 11:00 p.m.

450
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,268
You have no idea how many times
I asked them to always keep it open.

451
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,353
It sounds like a good idea.
Why won't they?

452
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,646
That's not all.

453
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,649
You know that footbridge at Noksapyeong
where you can see Namsan?

454
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,818
As you know, it has an amazing view.

455
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,362
I suggested that we should turn it
into a tourist spot

456
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,239
and decorate it nicely with an artist,

457
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,325
but they never listened to me.

458
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,869
That sounds nice.

459
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,537
Why didn't they do it?

460
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,830
Apparently,

461
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,958
no one's ever done anything
like that before.

462
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,588
I can give them all sorts of ideas,
but they always just ignore me.

463
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,506
It's useless.

464
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,057
DANBAM

465
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,268
It's important to have regulars
when your business is in the alley.

466
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,897
I'm sure it'll get better,
so just hang in there.

467
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,774
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

468
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,236
Baldy.

469
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,113
You've matured enough
to give advice now.

470
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,074
Long time no see.

471
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,700
Do you know her?

472
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes. Did you borrow money from her?

473
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,373
No, she's our regular.

474
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,708
I'm relieved to hear that.

475
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,586
Always borrow money from the bank,
or you'll get in trouble.

476
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,296
What are you saying?

477
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,382
Have you forgotten the past?

478
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,218
My gosh, you still have a temper.

479
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,220
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

480
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,223
-Okay. Stay healthy, ma'am.
-Okay, bye.

481
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,101
I'm here to eat.

482
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,772
What's going on? Have you closed already?

483
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,400
No. Toni, please take her to a table.

484
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,193
Hello.

485
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,444
My gosh, you startled me.

486
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,030
I guess there aren't any customers.

487
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,490
No.

488
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,159
What did I tell you?
It's a bad place to do business.

489
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,454
You're practically cursing us.

490
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,123
Yi-seo.

491
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,500
What's wrong with this neighborhood?

492
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,256
That rude little brat.

493
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,509
Do you think I'm wrong?

494
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,219
Look around you.

495
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,306
All the other places are closed already.

496
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,267
I'll try to revive it.

497
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,604
That's absurd.
How are you going to do that?

498
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,647
The entire neighborhood is dead.

499
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,026
I'll get you some food.

500
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,487
Just sell the place and get out of here.
It's the best you can do.

501
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,990
PARK SAEROYI

502
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,184
MARUDANG RESTAURANT

503
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,481
Thank you.

504
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,233
-Have some juice.
-Thank you.

505
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,534
JOJO'S PLACE

506
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,791
What is he doing?

507
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,585
How would I know?

508
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,464
Why are you here?

509
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,592
As you can see, our boss is really busy

510
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,220
doing a bunch of useless stuff.

511
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,554
I'm here to see you.

512
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,391
What?

513
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,643
You met with the chairman.

514
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,480
He thinks you're just like him.

515
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,401
He thinks I'm just like him?
What a horrible thing to say.

516
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,445
But I'm not that offended.

517
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,867
Did you say you're working here
because of Saeroyi?

518
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,413
-Yes.
-You say he's the only reason.

519
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,874
But what if he rejects you?

520
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,668
Because of you?

521
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,086
Yes.

522
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,171
Then what would happen?

523
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,048
Would that make you quit?

524
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,385
That won't happen.

525
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,764
I've never lost before.

526
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,856
Soo-ah.

527
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,405
What are you doing?

528
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,408
What?

529
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,831
Oh, the Vietnamese restaurant
seems to have

530
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,877
an inefficient menu and table arrangement,
so I wanted to help.

531
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,920
Why do you want to help?

532
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,215
-What?
-What's with the sudden charity work?

533
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,967
Hey, what's your problem this time?

534
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,261
I just don't get it.

535
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,472
I want an explanation so I can understand.

536
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,483
I'm doing it to survive.

537
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,444
What are you talking about?

538
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,696
Our pub isn't even doing that well.

539
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,531
You should focus on our pub first--

540
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,699
What more do we need?

541
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,621
What more can we do to improve DanBam?

542
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,709
Thanks to you,
our marketing strategy is doing well.

543
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,961
And the interior came out great.

544
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,839
What more do we need to improve? The food?

545
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,384
You said the food tastes good.

546
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,595
So what?

547
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,890
Are you trying to befriend the neighbors
to make them our regulars?

548
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,892
All the businesses
in this alley are dying.

549
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,186
Nothing will improve
just by focusing on our pub.

550
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,148
We need to revitalize the alley.

551
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,367
I really can't believe this.

552
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,994
What?

553
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,081
You're a dreamer, an idealist...

554
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,545
We really aren't a great match.

555
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,305
Don't mind her.

556
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,474
She's supposed to do what she's told.

557
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,978
Didn't you tell us we're a team

558
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,480
when you incorporated the business?

559
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,320
-What?
-It's easy to do as we're told.

560
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,114
But...

561
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,576
is that the kind of team you wanted?

562
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,292
We're mere employees,
so we just need to do

563
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,419
as the chairman says.

564
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,505
Well...

565
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,176
We might be nothing
but ordinary employees.

566
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,511
-Geun-soo--
-But

567
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,348
Yi-seo is different.

568
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,726
She's the manager.

569
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,687
It's a small corporation,
but she's a stockholder.

570
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,938
On top of that,

571
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,110
she bet her life on you.

572
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,032
The least you can do
is try to convince her.

573
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:42,950
Geun-soo,

574
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,535
what's with you today?

575
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,040
Yi-seo just seems
a little different these days.

576
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,086
She's different with Saeroyi.

577
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,271
Everything Geun-soo said was right.

578
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,107
I didn't know what to say.

579
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,069
By the way,

580
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,862
about Geun-soo--

581
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,780
I know.

582
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,199
He's Chairman Jang's second son.

583
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,332
I understand that you don't really care.

584
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,501
But what about him?

585
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,296
I wonder why he's working at DanBam.

586
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm not sure.

587
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,137
Maybe he wants to make money.

588
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,184
What about Yi-seo?

589
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,647
Why do you think Yi-seo is working there?

590
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,691
What?

591
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,989
I'm sure you need her to succeed.

592
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,618
Why? What are you curious about?

593
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,581
Now, I feel like there are so many reasons

594
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,043
why we can't be together.

595
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,049
What's the matter? Did something happen?

596
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,803
What kind of relationship is this?

597
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,805
What?

598
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,476
What do you think would've happened to us

599
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,895
if I didn't work at Jangga Co.?

600
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,944
Whether or not you work there,

601
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,865
you're the one who gets to decide
what our relationship is.

602
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,664
You always make me the responsible one.
But you never once confessed how you feel.

603
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,209
I like you.

604
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,384
I told you that when I was in prison.

605
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,306
That was ten years ago.

606
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,932
And the bus stop?

607
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,977
That was pretty recent.

608
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,813
Are you kidding me?

609
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:19,899
You told me

610
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,651
you're going to make me quit.
You call that a confession?

611
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,907
What more do I need to say
to get my point across?

612
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,161
My gosh.

613
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,123
I bet my life on it when I told you that.

614
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,837
No pressure. But just keep it in mind.

615
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:43,964
You can define

616
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,593
our relationship whenever you want.

617
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,806
That's who Saeroyi is.

618
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,141
He won't change.

619
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,314
I once said that myself.

620
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,483
What?

621
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,784
You're the biggest fool on earth.

622
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,955
Remember what I told you?

623
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,165
I like rich people.

624
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,965
I own a building.

625
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,849
That's not easy, you know.

626
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,645
My gosh.

627
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,866
My gosh, you startled me.

628
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,993
What? What do you want?

629
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,787
I heard you left last night
with that girl.

630
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,205
-Soo-ah?
-Yes.

631
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,791
-Yes.
-What did you guys do?

632
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,044
-We drank.
-Did something happen?

633
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,423
-Like what?
-Are you guys dating?

634
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,803
Stop talking nonsense
and get ready for business.

635
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,055
I'm not talking nonsense.

636
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,767
Don't go out with her.

637
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,437
What?

638
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,772
Why do you care?

639
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,940
I just do.

640
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,359
If you go out with her,

641
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,863
I'm going to quit.

642
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,533
What are you talking about?

643
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,369
Why do you hate her so much?

644
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,537
Do you really not know?

645
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,373
Do you really not know why?

646
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,501
No, I don't.

647
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,047
Just keep it in mind.

648
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,347
What's wrong with her?

649
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:10,194
One, two three, four, and five.

650
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,612
That's ten...

651
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,571
Let's see.

652
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,741
It's the right amount. Thank you.

653
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,452
Next month,
I'll make sure I pay you on time.

654
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,623
What's going on?

655
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,458
You have customers.

656
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,252
Of course.

657
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,295
The young man who runs DanBam

658
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,464
helped us with our marketing
and other stuff.

659
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,175
-Saeroyi?
-Yes.

660
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,636
He also helped us fix our menu
and table arrangement.

661
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,179
It's not just us.

662
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:41,100
He's been helping
a lot of people these days.

663
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,731
The restaurant looks better than before.

664
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,818
That young man is very polite,
and he knows a lot of things.

665
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,319
He's very admirable.

666
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,906
How interesting.

667
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,326
He reminds me of someone.

668
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,622
Welcome, Mr. Oh.

669
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,170
I came across a dish
that was made with your ingredients.

670
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,382
The ingredients were high in quality
and fresh.

671
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,884
It made me want to buy from you as well.

672
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,345
Thank you.

673
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,225
You signed an exclusive distribution deal

674
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,687
with DanBam in Itaewon, right?

675
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,397
Yes, that's right.

676
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,401
How would you like

677
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,404
to sign a deal with us?

678
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,705
I'm very grateful to receive
a business offer

679
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,625
from the number one food company in Korea.

680
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,794
But will there be a condition?

681
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,422
A condition?

682
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,762
I like that you're straightforward.

683
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,515
As you already know,
our company is very large in size.

684
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,686
If you sign a deal with us, you'll be
too busy to work with anyone else.

685
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,399
How about you break all the other deals
you've made

686
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,362
and sign an exclusive contract
with Jangga Co.?

687
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,866
You mean to break my contract with DanBam?

688
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,911
Yes, that's what you'll have to do.

689
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,330
But it won't be a bad deal.

690
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,017
Heading to Itaewon?

691
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,561
I'm on my way there, too.

692
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,313
Do you want a ride?

693
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,148
Why are you going to Itaewon?

694
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,734
Jo Yi-seo, was it?

695
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,237
The manager at DanBam.

696
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,697
I'm going to snag her.

697
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,324
Anyway, get in. I'll drop you off.

698
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,703
Didn't you get my message?

699
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,581
I clearly told you that I don't like you.

700
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,045
My gosh.

701
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,765
Do you know what my dream is?

702
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,645
It's to have you sit next to me in my car.

703
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,647
Isn't it a simple dream?

704
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,403
Where does your confidence come from?

705
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,073
The fact that you're the heir?
Or is it because you're rich?

706
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,118
Am I supposed to thank you
for your attention?

707
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,413
I never...

708
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,084
I never treated you like that.

709
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,461
I clearly told you

710
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,463
why I don't like you.

711
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:00,841
Yes, you did.

712
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,177
Because of the accident.

713
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,096
But it was literally an accident.

714
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,640
Do you think I hit him with my car
on purpose?

715
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,602
It's true that I hate Saeroyi,
but I would never--

716
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,811
What about after that?

717
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,192
What about after the accident?

718
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,281
You didn't call an ambulance.

719
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,451
And you let someone else take the blame.

720
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,287
Was that all an accident?

721
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,501
You have no idea

722
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,589
how much I hate you.

723
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,551
Soo-ah.

724
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,304
Oh, right.

725
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,811
Remember when you asked me
if I like Saeroyi?

726
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:56,772
What?

727
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:58,857
I like him.

728
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,362
So let me tell you once again.

729
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,322
Please do me a favor

730
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,742
and stop hitting on me.

731
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,707
Well then, Mr. Jang. I'll be off now.

732
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,261
Fuck!

733
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,807
PRODUCT SUPPLY AGREEMENT

734
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,565
This is a contract with good terms.

735
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,153
But

736
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,531
I'm afraid I have to turn it down.

737
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,412
Oh, gosh.

738
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,084
I heard you have a connection
with Saeroyi.

739
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,088
Are you being like this because of him?

740
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,884
Yes. I owe him something.

741
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,302
How much is it?

742
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,679
It's not something
I can pay back with money.

743
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,017
Let me give you a piece of advice.

744
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,063
Business isn't something
you should do emotionally.

745
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,441
You just said that yourself.

746
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,861
Jangga Co. is the best food company
in Korea.

747
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,321
I think it is for now.

748
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,948
-Then you should take it.
-But in ten years,

749
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,993
how much do you think

750
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,412
Saeroyi and DanBam

751
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,333
would grow?

752
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,503
This isn't about loyalty.

753
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,382
It's an investment for the future

754
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,093
to make a profit.

755
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:54,932
You're young.

756
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,560
Do you have children?

757
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,273
Yes. I have a daughter.

758
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,449
You sound like a reckless man
who has nothing to lose.

759
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,828
No good can come from going
against me in this industry.

760
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,832
You should think about your child.

761
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,796
You may leave now.

762
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,298
Call me if you change your mind.

763
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,558
I will get going then.

764
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,154
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

765
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,156
She kept bragging about you.

766
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,367
It sounded like you're a great dad.

767
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,288
Think about my child?

768
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,633
You know what, Chairman Jang?

769
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,431
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

770
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,850
Looking at you,

771
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,395
I can tell why Jang Geun-won
turned out like that.

772
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,983
You better not to provoke me.

773
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,070
I said I owe Saeroyi something.

774
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,072
The debt

775
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,075
has something to do with you too.

776
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,244
What?

777
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:42,205
The hit-and-run accident
of Jang Geun-won from ten years ago.

778
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,333
Unfortunately,

779
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,336
I was the cop in charge of the case.

780
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,800
He left the police about ten years ago

781
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,136
and started a produce supply business.

782
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,193
Is it you who--

783
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,821
Back then,
I conducted a shameful investigation.

784
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,617
My daughter will grow up
looking at my pathetic footstep.

785
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,621
One pathetic footstep is enough.

786
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,376
Because of my daughter,

787
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,922
I can't be any more pathetic than this.

788
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,208
Gosh.

789
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,132
You look like an old lady sometimes.

790
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,343
I want to be alone.

791
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,721
What are you thinking about?

792
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,351
I'm not sure what I'm doing now.

793
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,563
I know how you feel.

794
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,731
But what Saeroyi said.

795
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,568
Don't you think it's all correct?

796
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,072
Did his idealism rub off on you?

797
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,245
I didn't do enough research.

798
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,080
I'm sorry, sir.

799
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,875
What about Jo Yi-seo?

800
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,460
How long do I have to wait?

801
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,338
Mr. Jang is going to give her

802
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,132
a job offer today.

803
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,678
Geun-won?

804
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:02,888
Yes.

805
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,437
-I'm back.
-Geun-soo.

806
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:14,900
Hey.

807
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:17,903
You're here on time.

808
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,989
Hi.

809
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,162
What are you doing here?

810
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,956
I'm not here to see you.

811
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,418
You know me, right?

812
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,172
I'm Jang Geun-won.

813
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,382
JANGGA CO. JANG GEUN-WON

814
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,509
Can I talk to you for a moment?

815
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,765
Boss.

816
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,392
I'll go talk to him for a bit.

817
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,687
Sure.

818
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,983
There's a cafe down the hill.
Let's go there.

819
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,946
Look at her. She's so cool.

820
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,241
I like that.

821
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:05,700
Wait.

822
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,455
Why do you want to talk to her?

823
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,459
I guess you've lost your touch.

824
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,630
Whatever it is,

825
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,508
don't mess with Yi-seo.

826
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,636
Have you lost your mind?

827
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,809
Look at you.

828
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:32,936
Let go of me.

829
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,107
Hey.

830
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:42,737
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

831
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,951
you should take over Jangga Co.

832
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,752
You better not provoke me.

833
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,216
I might

834
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,886
take over your position.

835
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:13,768
You rascal.

836
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,564
Oh, right.

837
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,692
Was her name Jo Yi-seo?

838
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,611
I'm not messing with her.

839
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,780
I'm here to offer her a job.

840
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,660
Between this tiny pub and Jangga Co.?

841
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,871
She has no reason to hesitate.

842
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,752
Damn it.

843
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,172
What the hell is he talking about?
A job offer?

844
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,674
Does that mean he will take Yi-seo?

845
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,717
Boss.

846
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,177
Don't make a fuss.

847
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,221
What are you going to do?

848
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,182
It's Yi-seo's life.

849
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,558
It's her decision.

850
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,894
We should just wait and see.

851
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,530
MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL

852
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,743
You are just a 20-year-old kid
who didn't even go to college.

853
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,537
You can't get a great offer
like this elsewhere.

854
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,831
There's nothing to think about.

855
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,000
When will you join us?

856
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,717
JANGGA CO. JANG GEUN-WON

857
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,305
I'm sure.

858
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,766
If he offers a better salary,

859
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,643
she will definitely go there.

860
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,019
I don't know.

861
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:41,898
If it was about money, she wouldn't
have joined DanBam in the first place.

862
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,859
Exactly. Koreans are loyal and faithful.

863
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,364
She hasn't even worked here for long.

864
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,616
Loyal and faithful, my foot.

865
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,830
I'm going to quit.

866
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,874
Are you nervous?

867
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,629
We really aren't a great match.

868
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:10,969
Yes.

869
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,179
Do you need Yi-seo

870
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,057
because she's competent?

871
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,272
I'm just wondering how you feel.

872
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,194
What Yi-seo means to you.

873
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,281
Is she just an employee?

874
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,491
Or

875
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,036
do you have feelings for her?

876
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,164
What is he talking about?

877
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:40,915
What?

878
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,480
That is quite an offer.

879
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,190
Gosh.

880
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,026
It's not just good.

881
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,989
You may be too young to see it.
But this is a great opportunity.

882
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,032
Director Jang.

883
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,535
I invested some money in the pub,

884
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,079
so I'm making quite a lot for my age.

885
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,542
I guess I make more
than the salary you just offered.

886
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,503
It's Jangga Co. we're talking about.

887
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,088
If you can't offer me more money
than this tiny pub,

888
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,217
I will have to think about it.

889
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,181
I see. How much do you make?

890
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,185
Considering the sales,
I guess I make about 100 million won.

891
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,270
Is it 100 million won?

892
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,898
It's just based on current sales.

893
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,652
I'm confident I can make DanBam bigger.

894
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,404
I might be tempted

895
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,782
-if you offer 200 million won.
-200 million?

896
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,576
Oh, right. I guess

897
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:03,748
it's not something you can decide.

898
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,084
Is it 200 million?

899
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,965
Let's add 50 million won.

900
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,509
I'll make it 250 million.

901
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,972
What? 250 million...

902
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,183
Jangga Co. is unbelievable.

903
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,646
Saeroyi's pub will go down after all.

904
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,439
Hey.

905
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,276
Your life's path may change

906
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,153
according to the connection you choose.
Don't hesitate.

907
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:38,992
Actually I was fed up with Saeroyi
being so stubborn and inflexible.

908
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,370
Without my shares in the pub,
I would've quit already.

909
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,539
Now we are talking.

910
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,999
He's just an immature kid.

911
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,500
I know.

912
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,170
He just tries to mess with you
and Chairman Jang, forgetting who he is.

913
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,424
You must have your authority.

914
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,012
You're planning to smash DanBam, right?

915
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,182
You're quite quick-witted.

916
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,018
You're worth the money.

917
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,352
Thank you.

918
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,938
Let me save your number.

919
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,320
So when should I start working?

920
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,947
You can do it tomorrow or a week later.

921
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,741
Whatever works for you.

922
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:24,912
Oh, right.

923
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,040
I have a question.

924
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,250
About Park Saeroyi.

925
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,753
Why is that punk trying to mess with you?

926
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,422
What?

927
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,009
Something happened before.

928
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,720
What happened?

929
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,641
It's no big deal. You don't have to know.

930
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,894
Oh, right.

931
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,606
I guess it's because of the thing
you said at a police station.

932
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,484
I heard Park Saeroyi's dad died

933
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,903
because of you.

934
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,413
If that's true,

935
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,793
you are unbelievable.

936
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,714
What?

937
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,842
It means you're above the law.

938
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,807
That's amazing.

939
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,935
Oh, well...

940
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,437
Gosh,

941
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,481
I'm sorry.

942
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,943
I can't really discern right from wrong.

943
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,655
Did I offend you?

944
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,200
No.

945
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,786
That's just how people live.

946
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,499
The law is
all about disciplining the poor.

947
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:54,544
The law doesn't apply to those who rule.

948
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:59,132
So? Would you please tell me
about it in detail?

949
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,554
It's nothing. It was an accident.

950
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,057
I hit his dad with a car,

951
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,643
and he died instantly.

952
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,855
But someone else ended up in jail.

953
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,361
I wonder how Saeroyi found it out though.

954
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,490
I guess he hasn't learned his lesson.
He's still trying to get back at me.

955
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,535
But what can livestock do?

956
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,787
Don't you think so? There's nothing.

957
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,416
What can he do?

958
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,922
What is this scar?

959
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:44,719
I got hurt when I worked
on the deep-sea fishing vessel.

960
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,973
And what about this one?

961
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,267
When I did manual labor.

962
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,403
You must've had a hard time all alone.

963
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,912
I decided to kill

964
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,790
those who mess with this guy.

965
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,126
This is so sweet.

966
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,383
Enough.

967
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,973
I want you to stop now.

968
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,226
What?

969
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,353
Stop what?

970
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,400
RECORDING

971
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,110
Let me see.

972
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,072
Was it around here?

973
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,372
The law is
all about disciplining the poor.

974
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,458
The law doesn't apply to those who rule.

975
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,962
So? Would you please tell me
about it in detail?

976
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,549
It's nothing. It was an accident.

977
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,052
I hit his dad with a car,

978
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,638
and he died instantly.

979
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,850
But someone else ended up in jail.

980
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,437
What the hell are you doing?

981
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,067
I've never seen

982
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,279
a dumbhead like you my whole life.

983
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,196
Damn it.

984
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:36,956
I...

985
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,668
love my boss like crazy.

986
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,672
But the problem is

987
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:51,345
that his head is full of the bastards
from that damn Jangga Co.

988
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,351
I'm so jealous.

989
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,526
You damn sons of bitches.

990
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,041
So

991
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,295
I'm going to crush you all.

992
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,911
Your dad is my enemy.

993
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,122
To make him pay for his sins,
I'll do anything.

994
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,958
I'm Jo Yi-seo, the manager of DanBam.

995
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,167
This is important.

996
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,794
I'm afraid we should give up.

997
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:07,797
That's ridiculous. This fight will be ours
to win. Why give up?

998
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,424
-You can prove his innocence?
-I think we have a chance.

999
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,802
But I think
you need to have your son dismissed.

1000
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:16,639
Don't you dare tell me
to abandon my family ever again.

1001
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,808
Now is the right time
to dismiss the chairman.

1002
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,810
A proposal of dismissal?
Are you crazy?

1003
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,979
I will make you regret this.

1004
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:26,065
I'll offer my life
to make the same promise.

1005
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:28,818
It's still...

1006
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,070
bitter.
