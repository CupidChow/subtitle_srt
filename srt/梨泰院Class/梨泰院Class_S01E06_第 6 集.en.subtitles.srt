ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,105
EPISODE 6

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,816
Why are you having a hard time?

5
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,947
Don't be like that.

6
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,368
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

7
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,088
Be

8
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,048
a good girl.

9
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,600
Even as we were parting,

10
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,687
she didn't say

11
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,982
she'd come back for me.

12
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,903
-Did you hear about Soo-ah?
-What?

13
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:55,573
She lives at Gaenari Orphanage.
It's close to my place, you know.

14
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,325
I saw her walking out of the orphanage.

15
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,618
What does that mean?

16
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,870
Is she really an orphan?

17
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,289
My gosh. Her parents abandoned her?

18
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,667
I pity her.

19
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,339
Soo-ah, do you want this?

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,718
OH SOO-AH

21
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,889
You're really giving this to me?
I'm hungry, so this is perfect.

22
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,350
I have milk too.

23
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,523
You're the best.

24
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,484
CHOI GYEONG-HUI

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,876
Why did you do that?

26
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,296
-It wasn't me.
-During the PE class,

27
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,423
everyone was on the schoolyard
except for you.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,592
I was feeling sick,
so I went to the infirmary.

29
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,762
The other kids told me

30
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,932
that Gyeong-hui
was always very good to you.

31
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,853
She was good to me?

32
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,063
Like giving change to homeless people?

33
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,483
-What?
-Why even you won't believe me?

34
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,611
Because I'm an orphan?

35
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,156
Forget it.

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,741
You may leave.

37
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,620
I'll be off, then.

38
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,081
You've lost your chance.

39
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,918
A chance to reflect and repent.

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,963
I don't need

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,174
such a chance.

42
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,859
Seventeen is a young age.

43
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,614
A pitiful girl
whom even her own parents abandoned.

44
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,116
I thought,

45
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,830
"At least I should cherish myself."

46
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,629
A poor little girl
who was never loved by anyone.

47
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,049
I thought,

48
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,260
"At least I should love myself."

49
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,931
Our company runs a foundation.

50
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,519
We'd like to pay for your admission fee
and living expenses.

51
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,771
What do you think?

52
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,483
After that day, I keep justifying myself.

53
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,694
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,862
It would've been much better

55
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,366
to get bashed

56
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,537
for betraying someone I'm indebted to

57
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,706
or for turning against a friend.

58
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,876
You just tried your best for your life.

59
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,379
You didn't do anything wrong.

60
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,007
The thing is...

61
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,510
Saeroyi.

62
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,596
Go ahead.

63
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,146
To me...

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,481
you are...

65
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,950
shining

66
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,872
too much.

67
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,692
Defense.

68
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,445
Criminal Law Article 32.

69
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,615
Yi-seo.

70
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,700
A kiss without consent of the opposition

71
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,535
is an indecent assault.

72
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,839
Yi-seo, what are you doing?

73
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,049
Gosh.

74
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,176
Am I interrupting?

75
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,763
Do you give her consent to kiss you?

76
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,561
You punk.

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,980
That totally sobered me up.

78
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,109
Everyone's waiting.

79
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,027
It's our first team dinner
after we reopened.

80
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,695
You need to be there as our boss.

81
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,575
Go on in.
I'll call her a taxi and head inside.

82
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,328
It's okay. Don't worry.

83
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,080
I'll call a taxi for her.

84
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,792
Where do you live?

85
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,175
I asked you where you live.

86
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,055
I said, it's fine.

87
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,101
You have a team dinner?

88
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,186
Yes.

89
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,314
I drank on an empty stomach,
so I could use some food now.

90
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:21,983
Can I join you guys?

91
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,279
What?

92
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,615
What's she talking about?
It's our team dinner.

93
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,369
I asked your boss, not you.

94
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,958
Can I?

95
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,047
No?

96
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,612
All right. This needs to be shaken first.

97
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,697
Like this.

98
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,578
-Saeroyi, let me pour you one.
-Sure.

99
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,164
You worked so hard today.

100
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,049
I'm not sure if it's okay for me
to join you guys like this.

101
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,720
You insisted on joining us.
Why wonder that now?

102
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,100
You're our boss' friend,
so you're more than welcome to join us.

103
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,227
Let's give her a big hand.

104
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,774
-Jeez.
-Thank you.

105
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,528
I think I saw you in the area
a little while ago.

106
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,864
Right. I work at Jangga Pub.

107
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,620
You look familiar too.

108
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,705
Oh, yes.

109
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,500
Last year, at the entrance...

110
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,002
Right, that minor!

111
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,340
You little punks. You tried
getting into a bunch of bars, I see.

112
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,925
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,094
Didn't we meet before that?

114
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,596
Even back then,
I thought you looked familiar.

115
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,058
I'm not sure.

116
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,650
This meat dish is so good.

117
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,402
Yes, it's delicious. What is this?

118
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,862
Fried pork belly.
Eat the meat with chives.

119
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,281
It'll taste even better.

120
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,326
-What do you think, Hyun-yi?
-It's good.

121
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,121
This restaurant is good.
I posted about it on my blog.

122
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,456
I gave it four stars.

123
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,792
Four stars from you?
That means it's really good.

124
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,838
What about DanBam?

125
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
How many stars do we get?

126
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,510
DanBam?

127
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,479
-Three.
-Three stars?

128
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,814
Seriously? That's it?

129
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:11,152
Three stars means
itâ€™s a pretty decent pub.

130
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,279
Interesting.

131
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,658
Then is there a place in Itaewon
that deserves five stars?

132
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,787
Yes, there is.

133
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,589
Jangga Pub.

134
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,218
Location, service, and interior.

135
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,430
Everything about it is perfect.
But the best thing of all

136
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,974
is the taste.

137
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,394
I heard the chairman
made the recipes himself.

138
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,400
He really is amazing.

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,614
Hyun-yi will become just as good.

140
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
-What?
-Don't get me wrong.

141
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,079
Hyun-yi's already a good cook.

142
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,957
But Jangga Co. is a huge corporation
with over ten successful brands.

143
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,835
Their business is so much bigger,
and we have different goals.

144
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,964
No, we don't.

145
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,968
My goal is to franchise DanBam.

146
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,562
You don't become a franchise
just by expanding your business.

147
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,564
I never expected it to be easy.

148
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,275
I don't mind the hurdles.

149
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,070
It might not be easy on my own,

150
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,447
but I have you guys.

151
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,992
We can do it. I know it for sure.

152
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,002
You don't think you have a chance because
you're a poor, undereducated ex-con?

153
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,047
You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.

154
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,966
Why not decide after trying?

155
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,346
He's right. If he thinks we can do it,
then we can do it.

156
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,892
Yes, we can franchise the pub
and do anything we want.

157
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,352
I'll work five times...

158
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,146
No, I'll work ten times harder.

159
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,274
Then I guess we should trust him
and give it a go.

160
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,370
We can...

161
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,746
-Do it!
-Do it!

162
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,141
You never say what I don't want to hear.

163
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,476
It is time for action,

164
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,314
not words.

165
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,697
Why did you lie?

166
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,407
What are you talking about?

167
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,659
I heard you weren't the one

168
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,621
who reported to the police.

169
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,589
And I can't believe
you tried to kiss him earlier.

170
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,931
Yes, you were impudent enough
to get in the way.

171
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,895
Why do you care?
I thought you didn't like Saeroyi.

172
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,694
I like him a lot.

173
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,076
Really? Good luck.

174
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,913
I'm a little twisted,

175
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,625
so I even received counseling
back when I was in middle school.

176
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,004
-What?
-The doctor told me

177
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,883
there's a 79 percent probability
that I might be a sociopath.

178
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,471
So what?

179
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,140
Are you trying to tell me

180
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,268
that you're a psycho?

181
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,147
Here's my point.

182
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,360
There are people who must get
what they want no matter what.

183
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,655
If anyone gets in the way,

184
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,199
they do everything they can
to destroy that person.

185
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,493
I'm like that.

186
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,246
-So what--
-Let me...

187
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,915
Let me

188
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,210
paraphrase it for you.

189
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,132
I like my boss.

190
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,554
Okay.

191
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,267
But that's too bad.

192
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,394
Like I told you before,

193
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,731
Saeroyi likes me.

194
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,485
You know that, right?

195
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,032
Then that leaves me with no choice.

196
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,329
I'll just have to

197
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,664
destroy you.

198
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,425
Good luck.

199
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,802
Cutie.

200
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,780
Are you Seo Jeong-in from Jea Foods?

201
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,824
Yes, you must be Jang Geun-won.

202
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,285
Yes, I'm sorry I'm late.
There was traffic.

203
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,912
It's okay.

204
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,500
I already ordered before you came.
Is that okay?

205
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,417
Yes.

206
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,923
Is this your first time?

207
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,260
-Sorry?
-You seem uncomfortable.

208
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,055
Either that or you don't like me.

209
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,268
Why wouldn't I like you?
Jea Foods is an amazing company.

210
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,901
Here's your food.

211
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,039
You should try it.
It's French roast chicken.

212
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,541
It's good.

213
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,637
I don't really like chicken.

214
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,392
That's funny.

215
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,854
I can't believe the eldest son
of the biggest food company in Korea

216
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,230
doesn't like chicken.

217
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,986
-Can you give us the menu?
-Sure.

218
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,617
-Sir.
-Give me a minute.

219
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,833
Sir.

220
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,336
-What is it?
-About this family photo...

221
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,091
The guy standing next to you...
Is he your son?

222
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,094
He's my second son.

223
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,389
By any chance,

224
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,518
did you make him work there
because of Saeroyi?

225
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,981
What do you mean?

226
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:48,692
Make him work where?

227
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,778
Your second son.

228
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,031
Why is he working at DanBam?

229
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,493
What?

230
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,669
Are you saying

231
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,923
Geun-soo is working for Park Saeroyi?

232
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,217
Yes.

233
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,054
I'm sorry. I guess you didn't know.

234
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,021
How is his pub doing these days?

235
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,524
It's doing well.

236
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,027
People even wait in line these days.
The business is growing rapidly.

237
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,823
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

238
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,783
Director Jang Geun-won is here, sir.

239
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,743
Tell him to come in. Bring us some tea.

240
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,290
His business is doing well?

241
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,543
Why?

242
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,676
-I'll come back.
-Don't bother.

243
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,178
How did the blind date go?

244
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,685
Nothing happened.

245
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,189
Sit down. I want you to hear this too.

246
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,695
Seriously. Nothing happened.

247
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,418
JO YI-SEO

248
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,170
Her name is Jo Yi-seo.

249
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,922
Jo Yi-seo? What is this about?

250
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,009
DanBam.

251
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:38,760
She's 20 years old?

252
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,262
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,557
What would a 20-year-old know?

254
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,559
You think his pub is doing well

255
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,728
because of her?

256
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,646
Yes, sir.

257
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,982
She's an Internet celebrity
and a famous power blogger.

258
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,109
Her marketing is very effective.

259
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,778
She may be young,
but she knows the market trend,

260
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,322
and she has great judgment.

261
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,699
She's quick-witted and sharp judgment?

262
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,868
Interesting.

263
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,578
Pardon?

264
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,914
That's what I think of you.

265
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,252
Thank you, sir.

266
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,505
Then what's your opinion

267
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,592
on Park Saeroyi?

268
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,188
In my opinion, Saeroyi

269
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,983
is rash and foolish.

270
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,279
He was always like that.

271
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,323
People rarely change.

272
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,243
He's soft

273
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,662
yet sturdy.

274
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,211
A normal person wouldn't hire
a 20-year-old as a manager.

275
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,005
But the results are great,

276
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,966
and he has good insight.

277
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,802
Once he sets a goal,

278
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,847
he makes it happen
although it may take some time.

279
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,560
And his employees trust him a lot
because of his honesty and tolerance.

280
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,731
You're overestimating him.

281
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,610
How many employees does he have?
Four? Five?

282
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,862
If he can't manage that many people,
he'd be a fool.

283
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,369
Why do you even care about that tiny pub?

284
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,746
Our company also started out
as a small street pub.

285
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,501
A person with a clear goal
can achieve many things.

286
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,295
Go on.

287
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,799
Saeroyi's goal right now

288
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,183
is to franchise his current pub, DanBam.

289
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,771
"Franchise"?

290
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,984
He must be crazy.

291
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,490
Let's stop here.

292
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,909
Continue to keep an eye on his pub.

293
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,703
Yes, sir.

294
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,046
The chairman asked Ms. Oh
to keep an eye on DanBam,

295
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,257
a pub that's owned by a guy
named Park Saeroyi.

296
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,051
"Park Saeroyi."

297
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,558
"DanBam."

298
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,312
MANAGER, JO JEONG-MIN

299
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,734
Ms. Jo, didn't you say your daughter
got accepted to Sungyoon University?

300
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,861
Yes, she got in with the highest grades.

301
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,156
Then I guess she's just working part-time.

302
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,657
What do you mean?

303
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,951
Look. This is Yi-seo.

304
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,084
THANK YOU FOR VISITING DANBAM

305
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,961
TOMORROW, WE'LL COME BACK
WITH EVEN BETTER FOOD AND SERVICE

306
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,009
Thank you.

307
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,888
What? You want my number?

308
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,683
Yes, your number. Can I have your number?

309
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,186
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,611
Please?

311
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,824
I'm sorry. I like some already.

312
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,035
How much did we make in total?

313
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,662
36,200,000 won.

314
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,289
That's not too bad.

315
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,375
It's all thanks to you.

316
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,378
I want to do better.

317
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,839
What do you think about the idea
I suggested last time?

318
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,632
-Appearing on TV?
-Yes.

319
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,510
But we might not get picked
just because we apply.

320
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,180
You said it'll be the most effective
marketing strategy, so let's do it.

321
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,140
Okay.

322
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,352
Don't go back on your word
once we start doing well.

323
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,356
-What are you talking about?
-The terms of my employment.

324
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:05,443
You promised me 20 percent of net sales
instead of a monthly paycheck.

325
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,157
We were running on a loss before you came.

326
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,410
I was going to pay you
even if we didn't make any profit.

327
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,452
So it's for the better.

328
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,167
We're running short on manpower
with all the customers we've been getting.

329
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,212
We need an extra kitchen assistant
and a server during the weekends.

330
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,757
-Okay.
-I'll post the job opening online.

331
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,735
What? Why are you still up?

332
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,448
Have you been up all along,
or did you just wake up?

333
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,950
I called the admissions office.

334
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,873
They told me you didn't complete
your enrollment.

335
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,585
Why are you working part-time
instead of completing your enrollment?

336
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,214
-Mom.
-What are you thinking?

337
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,091
Are you trying to apply for Harvard again?

338
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
I'm a manager there.

339
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,180
-What?
-I got hired as a manager.

340
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,431
That's what I don't get!

341
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,188
Why would you work there
instead of going to university?

342
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,648
Why?

343
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,359
By any chance,

344
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,570
is this regarding
what you mentioned last time?

345
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,115
Do you like someone? Does he work there?

346
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,533
Yes.

347
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,618
He's the owner.

348
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,964
-What's that?
-I know.

349
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,966
You already made a choice,

350
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,511
so I know I can't make you
change your mind.

351
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,265
I packed your stuff.

352
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,558
I want you out of here.

353
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,813
Mom.

354
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,400
I only wanted you to hear

355
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,487
and see good things.

356
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,781
But

357
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,660
I was born poor,
and I have nothing to give you.

358
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,246
So I did everything I could
to raise you well.

359
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,668
Mom.

360
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,420
But

361
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,715
you were so clever

362
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,553
and extremely smart,
so I figured you'd never end up like me.

363
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,724
Of all the traits you could take after,
why does it have to be this one?

364
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,311
-Don't you know what I had to go through?
-I'm not like you.

365
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,690
-What?
-I'm smart and clever.

366
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,693
-What?
-I can achieve

367
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,613
both love and success.

368
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,284
So your goal

369
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,829
is to help that owner with his business?

370
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,913
Then what?

371
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,790
Will you become a pub owner's wife?

372
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,334
That's not how I was raised.

373
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,129
I'm not depending on someone else's dream.

374
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,882
And I'm not going to live
your dream either.

375
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,842
I'm going to live for myself.

376
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,178
It's my life.

377
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,016
-Yi-seo.
-Thank you

378
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,351
for raising me so well.

379
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,145
I won't take too long.

380
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,939
I'm a lot more competent than you think.

381
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,239
I'll be off now.

382
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,533
Feel sad just for a little while.

383
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,768
Yi-seo.

384
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,732
You got off work a while ago.
What are you doing here?

385
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,944
I was thinking about you.

386
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,862
What?

387
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,368
What about you?
Why are you jogging here all of sudden?

388
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,245
Jogging is my hobby.

389
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,331
This is a great course to jog.

390
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,216
Did something happen?

391
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,802
I made my mom cry.

392
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,723
Why?

393
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,685
Because I refused to live
the way she wanted me to live.

394
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,273
She wanted me to go to a good university,
get a job at a big firm,

395
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,400
and marry a guy from a decent family.

396
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,653
I guess she didn't like what I was doing.

397
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,492
Geun-soo did tell me

398
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,872
that you're working at the pub
instead of going to university.

399
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,375
Why didn't you stop me?

400
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,050
Let me guess.

401
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,386
You wanted to respect my choice
because it's my life?

402
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,558
No.

403
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,313
Because I need you.

404
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,617
If your mother wants you to get a job

405
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,286
at a big firm,

406
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:55,084
maybe DanBam could
eventually grow into one.

407
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,218
Am I being too selfish?

408
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,678
I haven't

409
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,891
really consoled anyone before.

410
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,898
That just consoled me

411
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,192
more than anything.

412
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,197
But I'm a little surprised.

413
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,158
I didn't know you'd be brazen enough
to say something like that.

414
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,453
Well,

415
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,580
I have you.

416
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,256
During our team dinner,
you said you want DanBam

417
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,718
to grow into a bigger franchise
than Jangga Co.

418
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,930
-Yes.
-That means

419
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,016
you want to be the best
in the food business.

420
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,771
I'll make it happen.

421
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:06,072
They say, "The bigger you dream,
the bigger you'll grow."

422
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,033
You're a man of your word, right?

423
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,455
You're not full of bullshit, right?

424
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,083
Bull...

425
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,168
Bull... What?

426
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,090
Let's make it happen together.

427
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,594
Okay.

428
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,965
You look prettier with black hair.

429
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,717
Sis.

430
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,763
DANBAM NATIONAL GYMNASTICS

431
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,101
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Ready...

432
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,896
-What?
-You did your hair?

433
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,565
Oh, my hair...

434
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,151
Gosh, I almost didn't recognize you.

435
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,488
I told you that you look better
with black hair.

436
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,114
It's pretty.

437
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,660
It really is pretty. Don't you agree?

438
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,746
What? Yes, I guess.

439
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,249
It looks good on you.

440
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,428
By any chance,

441
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,682
did you make him work there
because of Saeroyi?

442
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,642
Park Saeroyi.

443
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,562
How peculiar.

444
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm so bothered by him for some reason.

445
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,199
GUBGOO

446
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,034
APPLICANTS

447
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,786
We have so many applicants.

448
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,832
-This is going to take longer than a day.
-Why?

449
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,546
You applied for the part-time job?

450
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,589
Yes, sir.

451
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,719
I'm a huge fan, Ms. Jo.

452
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,763
Out. Okay.

453
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,349
Okay.

454
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,393
I don't like any of the applicants.

455
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,746
I saw a job opening online.

456
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,498
-Are you still hiring?
-My gosh, you pass.

457
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,625
-What?
-What?

458
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,918
I mean...

459
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,212
Yes, you're hired.

460
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,756
I mean, we're hiring. Saeroyi.

461
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,633
End of interview.

462
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,803
Hey, you're...

463
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,805
Hello.

464
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,731
She used to work at Seok-cheon's pub.

465
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,317
Why did you quit?

466
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,444
I'll be going back to school soon.

467
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,822
I don't have time to work full-time,
so I'm searching for a part-time job.

468
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,495
I promise I'll work really hard.
Please hire me, Saeroyi.

469
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,166
We'd love to--

470
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,919
You'll hear the results via text.

471
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,670
What?

472
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,091
Oh, okay. You can text me.

473
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,384
I'll be waiting, Saeroyi.

474
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,844
Okay, I'll see you again.

475
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,063
-Not hired.
-What?

476
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,192
-What?
-Why? Why not?

477
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,069
My gut tells me so.

478
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,196
What kind of gut is that?

479
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,698
Saeroyi, no one else is prettier...

480
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,370
I mean, no one's better than her.

481
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,622
Yi-seo, what's wrong with you?

482
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,458
What kind of person do you want?

483
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,845
Just hire her. She's nice.

484
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,098
-Sixty-seven...
-Will you please just hire her?

485
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,058
What do you know about her?

486
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,610
We're not open yet,
but I don't speak English.

487
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,366
What?

488
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,660
Are you the owner?

489
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,039
May I help you?

490
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:12,378
I'm here for an interview
for the server position.

491
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,636
Your name is Toni?

492
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,680
Yes, it's Kim Toni.

493
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,557
How long have you been in Korea?

494
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,933
I've been here for a year.

495
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,977
Your Korean is very good.

496
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,230
I'm Korean. My dad is Korean.

497
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,278
Have you ever worked as a server at a pub?

498
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,946
No, I haven't.

499
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,287
-What do you think?
-Him?

500
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,790
I never even thought
of hiring a foreigner.

501
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,085
-Do you think Saeroyi will hire him?
-Yi-seo won't hire him.

502
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,670
I'm not sure.

503
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,173
She actually might...

504
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,758
Let's hire him.

505
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,554
-What?
-We need to work with him

506
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,556
to see if heâ€™s a hard worker or not.

507
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,143
But we're in Itaewon, and I'm the only one
who can speak English.

508
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,978
It's a good thing.

509
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,272
It'll be nice to have a foreigner around.

510
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,441
But I'm Korean.

511
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,527
Right. Okay.

512
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,364
Can you start tomorrow?

513
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,491
Yes, cool.

514
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,827
-What?
-I can start tomorrow.

515
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,996
Oh, cool.

516
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,085
We'll be working together,
so is it okay if I talk more comfortably?

517
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,045
Sure, cool.

518
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,880
Cool.

519
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,638
-Hello.
-Hi.

520
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,640
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

521
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,433
-Hello.
-Hello.

522
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,231
Hello, sir.

523
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,858
There are a lot of customers.
Your sales increased.

524
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,569
Yes, Ms. Oh is helping us out a lot.

525
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,073
Don't lie to me. I can already imagine
how difficult she must be.

526
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,661
You should've done well
while I was in charge.

527
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,371
My goodness.

528
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,748
But what brings you here all of a sudden?

529
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,752
Shouldn't Ms. Oh be here by now?

530
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,882
-We checked everything, and it's fine.
-Okay.

531
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,843
Put that box inside.

532
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,138
-We'll be off now.
-Thank you.

533
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,222
Bye.

534
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,060
Don't you think
I should get paid for this?

535
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,438
Here.

536
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,525
Why did you move out all of a sudden?

537
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,902
I got caught working
instead of going to university.

538
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,406
What?

539
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,241
Did you get kicked out?

540
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,369
Hang on.

541
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,956
Hello?

542
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,207
How have you been, sir?

543
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,501
I've been doing well.

544
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,712
Did you check my proposal?

545
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,173
Oh, really?

546
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,468
Thank you so much.

547
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,303
That's great.

548
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,472
Sure.

549
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,474
Our pub is really popular in Itaewon.

550
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,893
I wouldn't work here for no reason.

551
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,562
All right. Okay.

552
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,231
Thank you, Director.

553
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,360
It's done.

554
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,153
Director?
Was it from a broadcasting company?

555
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,446
Hang on.

556
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,742
Boss.

557
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,413
I finally got our pub
introduced in a TV show.

558
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:42,046
Did you see my proposal?
It sounds great, doesn't it?

559
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,800
Where are you?

560
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,762
Oh, okay. They want to see you
at the company tomorrow.

561
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,016
Really?

562
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,395
That's great. Okay. I'll be right there.

563
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,148
Hey.

564
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,026
Hey, Soo-ah.

565
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,694
Something good must be happening.

566
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,782
Our pub will be introduced
in a TV show called The Best Pub.

567
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,659
The Best Pub?

568
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,828
The cooking competition show?

569
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,956
Yes. You know it. I heard it's a new show.

570
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,084
I see. So you managed
to clinch the deal somehow.

571
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,461
I heard they are
mostly franchise restaurants.

572
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,047
Yi-seo did a good job.

573
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,347
Did you go home safely that night?

574
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,475
I'm sorry.

575
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,561
I got drunk and made a scene.

576
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,229
What?

577
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,398
It's nothing.

578
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,317
Thanks to you, I feel much better now.

579
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:47,778
What?

580
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,285
You told me.

581
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,038
That I'm just trying my best for my life.

582
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,041
I did.

583
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,712
Saeroyi.

584
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,216
I will keep on

585
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,262
living my life to the fullest.

586
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,350
I've lived as an employee of Jangga.

587
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,769
And I will continue to do so.

588
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,316
Soo-ah.

589
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,365
Thank you for what you've done for me.

590
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,412
You seriously shouldn't

591
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,791
like me anymore.

592
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,323
What will you do about Park Saeroyi?

593
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,075
What do you mean?

594
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,077
He's been annoying lately.

595
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,746
Should I get rid of him?

596
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,043
He's an ex-convict who got expelled
from school and lost his dad.

597
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,379
He could've caved in,

598
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,965
but he's doing just fine.

599
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,093
You said those with determined goals
are hard to deal with.

600
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,511
Right.

601
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,140
He might even start a brand
named DanBam someday.

602
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,725
My point.

603
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,395
-So before he poses a threat--
-And it's just that.

604
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,314
What?

605
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,066
You work to make money.

606
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,403
That's what anyone can do.

607
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,034
But there's the next level.

608
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,037
The next level?

609
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,539
You should let things

610
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,041
make money without working.

611
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,504
You could build such systems or invest.

612
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,299
There are a lot of ways.

613
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,550
And it's your way of thinking

614
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,595
where the difference comes from.

615
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,848
So he worked diligently and constantly.

616
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,475
It's a big deal only to ordinary people.

617
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,520
Ten years is a long time.

618
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,692
What he's achieved with a solid goal
for ten years is just one pub.

619
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,486
There's no way

620
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,740
he will pose a threat to us.

621
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,164
Then why are you so bothered about him?

622
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,796
So you're interested in Ms. Oh.

623
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,639
I think she's well worthwhile.

624
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,225
Are...

625
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,270
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

626
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,982
If you can make her marry into our family,

627
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,984
I won't tell you
to have an arranged marriage.

628
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,659
But what does Park Saeroyi
have to do with Soo-ah?

629
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,788
He's like an assessor.

630
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,706
What?

631
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,335
An assessor that I'm using
to see if Ms. Oh is one of my people.

632
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,921
That's it.

633
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,552
An assessor...

634
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,182
He's just an assessor.

635
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,976
An assessor, right?

636
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,522
I'm sorry.

637
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,999
PROGRAM NAME
THE BEST PUB

638
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,588
-Hello.
-Hello.

639
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,965
Are you the owner of Danbam?

640
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,174
Yes.

641
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,477
You said there'd be another team.

642
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,354
Was it his pub?

643
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,691
Do you two know each other?

644
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,362
There are a lot
of distinguished brands out there.

645
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,698
A small store like his

646
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,492
will only weigh down the show.

647
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,663
It's not like you two are arch enemies.

648
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,665
We are enemies.

649
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,375
Oh, well...

650
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,293
Please have a seat.

651
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,189
Have you been doing well?

652
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,067
Soo-ah and you looked
good together the other day.

653
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,154
What?

654
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,365
You were with her at Itaewon.
So ten years...

655
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,039
You've stayed in touch
with her for ten years, right?

656
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,501
What's the deal between you two?

657
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,633
Did you know I'm interested in Soo-ah?

658
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,679
Considering her background
and my social position,

659
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,474
I didn't plan to marry her.

660
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,854
But unfortunately,
my father likes her too.

661
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,191
He says she's well worthwhile.

662
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:08,325
I guess she talked to you
out of pity a few times.

663
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,202
So did you fall for her?

664
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:16,375
Isn't it obvious?
She just did it out of pity.

665
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:20,837
Think about it. Would she want
to marry the son of Jangga

666
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,050
or date an ex-con
who barely finished middle school?

667
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,430
I don't know.

668
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,934
But I'm sure she wouldn't want a murderer.

669
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,817
Are you intimidated

670
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,987
by an ex-con who barely
finished middle school?

671
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,243
My gosh.

672
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,997
What else did my father say?
He talked about you.

673
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,251
You've worked so hard for ten years,

674
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,336
but all you have achieved
is opening a tiny pub.

675
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,881
He said you'd never be a threat to us.

676
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,467
"Park Saeroyi

677
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,513
is just like an assessor
to check up on Soo-ah's mind."

678
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,850
That's just what you are.

679
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,938
Pull yourself together, Saeroyi.

680
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,024
Know your place.

681
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,157
Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.

682
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,452
Can't you be more considerate?

683
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,287
And don't overrate yourself.

684
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,724
Hello?

685
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,852
What took you so long to answer my call?

686
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,854
I'm busy.

687
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:01,813
Why did you call?

688
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,565
Are you in Itaewon?

689
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,275
Yes. Why?

690
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,485
To see that jerk?

691
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,407
-Hey.
-I met him earlier.

692
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,159
Park Saeroyi.

693
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,203
You know The Best Pub, right?

694
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,664
The TV show I'm working on.

695
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,833
He came to the broadcasting company too.

696
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,544
I want to teach him a lesson.

697
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,258
-Are you...
-Don't like that jerk.

698
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,930
This isn't just about me.
What if my father finds out...

699
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,102
That crazy punk.

700
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,405
Hang on.

701
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,990
We've been working on it
according to your schedule.

702
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,201
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

703
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,744
No, I...

704
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,912
I get that.

705
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,206
You have to at least tell me the reason.

706
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,458
I need to be convinced.

707
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,210
Director?

708
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,294
Hello?

709
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,091
You startled me.

710
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,593
Why? What did they say?

711
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:26,898
The show.

712
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,901
It's canceled.

713
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,823
You're here.

714
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,660
Boss.

715
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,873
Did something happen
at the broadcasting company?

716
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:52,007
DANBAM

717
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,726
Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.

718
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,771
Can't you be more considerate?

719
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,108
The person

720
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,152
who reported your pub to the police.

721
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,906
It's me.

722
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,450
I've lived as an employee of Jangga.

723
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,869
And I will continue to do so.

724
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,635
What's the matter?

725
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,807
The show.

726
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,520
You've worked hard for the project.
I'm sorry.

727
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,439
It's no big deal.

728
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,316
There are a lot of other channels.

729
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,154
What?

730
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,323
Did the director pick a fight?

731
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,910
What happened?
What's that look on your face?

732
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,587
Shall we go take a walk?

733
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,633
Sure.

734
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,474
Aren't you going to tell me what happened?

735
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,102
Nothing happened.

736
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,773
I think you can tell me now.

737
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,734
Saeroyi.

738
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,118
Hey.

739
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,036
Are you on a date?

740
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,957
No way.

741
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,501
I was checking how things
are in other pubs.

742
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,842
You work at the office during the day

743
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,970
and come all the way to Itaewon
for the pub at night.

744
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,263
You must be tired.

745
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,558
I get paid more instead.

746
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,521
-Did you get off work?
-Yes.

747
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,860
Well...

748
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,320
About the TV show--

749
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,362
It's okay.

750
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,948
I can do it some other time.

751
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,117
It's not like there's only one TV show.

752
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:25,994
What?

753
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,624
You might miss the last bus.
Go home safely.

754
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,460
Shall we go back now?

755
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,454
I guess something huge happened.

756
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,581
What do you mean?

757
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,584
This isn't really like you.

758
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,544
I know.

759
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,048
I know I'm being pathetic.

760
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,218
So why did you do that?

761
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,221
I feel like I'm up against a wall.

762
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,145
Do you like her a lot?

763
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,775
What?

764
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,737
You know she reported our pub.

765
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,031
But you don't seem to have changed.

766
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,329
Are you talking about betrayal
or something again?

767
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,503
It's cold. Let's go.

768
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,339
My mom said

769
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,595
studying hard doesn't
really guarantee success these days.

770
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,390
So she let me learn a lot of things

771
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,726
like sports, music, go, and everything.

772
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,980
I liked to play go,
so I learned it for quite long.

773
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,899
But even when I played it
with someone who's a lot better than me,

774
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,152
I never did it with a handicap.

775
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,905
So you were quite daring
even when you were young.

776
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,782
But these days,

777
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,702
I feel like I'm playing go
with a handicap.

778
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,706
-A handicap?
-I mean the business suspension.

779
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,501
It's not her who reported it.

780
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:43,882
What?

781
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,092
It was someone else.

782
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,560
Who is it then?

783
00:55:56,644 --> 00:56:00,815
Someone who holds a grudge
against me called the police.

784
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,867
You go on ahead. I'll be right there.

785
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,964
No matter who my opponent was,

786
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,259
I eventually won.

787
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,638
So I'm not

788
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,599
giving up.

789
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,784
I know

790
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,454
what Jangga Co. means to you.

791
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,250
You can resent me.

792
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:09,384
Soo-ah is in trouble
at work because of you.

793
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,846
Can't you be more considerate?

794
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,618
You seriously shouldn't

795
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,080
like me anymore.

796
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:52,510
What?

797
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:53,928
Is something wrong?

798
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,181
What's the rush?

799
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,398
About today...

800
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,066
It's not you who reported my pub.

801
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:11,863
What do you mean?

802
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,323
Why?

803
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,492
Why did you lie to me?

804
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,078
Saeroyi.

805
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,623
Do you want me to hate you?

806
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,585
I told you.

807
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,921
Chairman Jang has an eye on you.

808
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,256
And I work for Jangga--

809
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,682
Sorry.

810
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,602
I'm sorry.

811
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,191
It's me who's being selfish.

812
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,110
I've only cared about myself.

813
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,075
I told you.

814
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,578
You shouldn't like me.

815
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,290
I'm sorry I made you struggle

816
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,544
between Jangga and me.

817
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,216
-Let go of me.
-Just a little more.

818
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,305
I know it's hard.

819
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,891
But hang in there for me a little more.

820
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,696
I should go.

821
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,865
I don't care whatever you do to me.

822
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,288
I told you.

823
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,415
Don't worry about me.

824
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,959
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

825
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,049
So that you won't suffer,

826
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,301
I'll...

827
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,762
destroy Jangga Co.

828
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,449
I'll make you quit to ease your mind.

829
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,145
You fool.

830
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,448
You've worked so hard for ten years,

831
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,825
but all you have achieved
is opening a tiny pub.

832
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,079
He said you'd never be a threat to us.

833
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,502
LEE HO-JIN

834
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,970
SAEROYI

835
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,141
Why are you calling me this late?

836
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,811
About my money invested in the hedge fund.

837
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:33,815
It's been in a little slump,
but I bet it will rise significantly soon.

838
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,735
How much is it in total
with the money invested in Jangga?

839
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,780
One second. Let me see.

840
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:46,285
With the money invested eight years ago...

841
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,707
It's 1.9 billion won.

842
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,460
Invest it all in Jangga.

843
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,601
-Chairman.
-What's the rush?

844
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,479
I found something in the stockholders'
list you talked about.

845
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,148
You need to see this.

846
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,736
STOCKHOLDERS' LIST

847
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,614
PARK SAEROYI,
HANNAM-DONG, YONGSAN-GU, SEOUL

848
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,369
What?

849
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,079
How much is this?

850
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,126
It's 1.9 billion won.

851
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:38,212
What's the matter?

852
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,714
What's 1.9 million won?

853
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,090
He invested in our company

854
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,218
eight years ago
when the stock price of Jangga plunged.

855
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,220
And this morning
he invested another 600 million--

856
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,430
Eight years ago?

857
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,475
The video of him spread quickly,

858
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,268
and it led to a sharp fall
in Jang's stocks

859
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,479
and a nationwide consumer boycott...

860
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,459
I thought I was hungry.

861
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,086
It's time to eat.

862
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,340
What?

863
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,685
DANBAM

864
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:36,687
Hello. Oh, wait.

865
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,565
We will open in 15 minutes.

866
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,139
Dad.

867
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,397
What? What are you doing here?

868
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,569
Oh, you are Geun-soo's father.

869
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,613
I'm Choi Seung-kwon
who works here with Geun-soo.

870
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,105
Eight years ago,

871
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:04,400
you probably got the death benefit
of your dad's death.

872
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,739
You invested the money in Jangga
right at the moment?

873
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,786
It had to be more meaningful.

874
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,957
I thought you were just a cat,

875
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,959
but you think you're at least a lynx.

876
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,171
It's too soon to tell.

877
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,717
You're an annoying little kid.

878
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:36,223
A SWEET NIGHT

879
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:42,146
I thought I was done trampling on you
as you got expelled and ended up in jail.

880
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,858
But I can tell
just by looking into your eyes.

881
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,905
Once he sets a goal,

882
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,824
he makes it happen
although it may take some time.

883
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,120
So your goal is my doom.

884
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,166
It's funny I'm feeling this way

885
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,502
at my age.

886
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,425
Hello. Welcome to DanBam.

887
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,203
I wanted to see you.

888
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,795
I really wanted to meet you too.

889
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,802
SPECIAL THANKS TO SEO EUN-SOO
AND JUNG YOO-MIN

890
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,818
What's the investment of this morning
supposed to mean?

891
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,486
I guess you're bothered about me.

892
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,197
Even if it's something personal,
you can share a little with me.

893
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,450
I want to be supportive.

894
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,119
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

895
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,495
you should take over Jangga Co.

896
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,414
Enough. You don't belong here.

897
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:24,790
Where do I belong?

898
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,625
Is Jangga where I belong?

899
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,335
A fight is all about the first punch.

900
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,963
And you throw the first punch
behind the back.

901
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,799
Jangga Co. should be led by you.

902
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,260
I can see his back.

903
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,974
