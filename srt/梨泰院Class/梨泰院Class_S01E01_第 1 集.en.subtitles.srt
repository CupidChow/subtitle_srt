PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

PATIENT CHART

4
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,068
What do you usually think about
before you sleep?

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,529
It's going to sound a little weird.

6
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,448
EPISODE 1

7
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,949
You might think I'm crazy.

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,372
I hope the world

9
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,376
comes to an end.

10
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,379
Are you going through something bad?

11
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,301
Well, not really.

12
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,888
Shall I say life feels like such a chore?

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,142
I actually sound crazy.

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,146
You probably think it's ridiculous
that such a young girl is saying this.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,816
Everyone feels that way about life
from time to time.

16
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,985
When do you feel that way the most?

17
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,699
I always feel that way.

18
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,827
Life is repetitive, you know.

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,328
And it's predictable.

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,456
You study hard
to get into a good university.

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,502
Then when you're older, you must work hard
to meet a nice guy and get married.

22
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,089
All the efforts that you have to make...

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,720
Frankly, everyone knows
how to become successful.

24
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,764
"How to become successful"?

25
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,934
-How do you do it?
-You just need to

26
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,229
work hard, like crazy.

27
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,315
But it feels like such a chore.

28
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,987
Is there anything that gives you joy?
Something you like, for example.

29
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,781
I've actually told my boss

30
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,617
what I just told you.

31
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,287
Oh, your boss who you always talk about.

32
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,955
What did your boss say?

33
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,124
If it feels that much like a chore,

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,379
just die.

35
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,435
That made me realize
that I'm acting like a moody teenager.

36
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,688
Your boss sounds a little irresponsible.

37
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,400
That's what you thought
when he told you to just die?

38
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,819
Well...

39
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,238
That's how counseling should be done.

40
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,032
Sorry?

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,036
An open, candid conversation over a drink.

42
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,412
You're leaving already?

43
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,205
I have to work.

44
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,958
You work so hard. I'll come by sometime.

45
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,628
Yes, you have to.
I'll give you lots of freebies.

46
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,712
DISCOUNT COUPON

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,971
The capital of Korea, Seoul.

48
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,558
In the center of it,
there's a district called Yongsan.

49
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,978
And the hottest buzzword,

50
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,438
Itaewon.

51
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
The average rent premium,
over 200 million won.

52
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,318
The third highest in Seoul.

53
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,528
On this small street,

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,698
you can see the world.

55
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,993
The story about those of us

56
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,828
on this street,

57
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,914
living our lives with our own values.

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,385
15 YEARS AGO

59
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,303
One day,
at the beginning of the semester...

60
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,056
JANGSEUNG HIGH SCHOOL

61
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,392
Hey, hold it up. Hold it properly!

62
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,019
I'll smack you guys
for each drop that spills.

63
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,147
You guys always skip
the after-school study hours!

64
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,650
I heard it's not obligatory.

65
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,568
PARK SAEROYI

66
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,987
Give me a break.

67
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,405
You guys don't have such freedom!

68
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,574
You'd all better step up your game.

69
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,160
Our class GPA is the lowest!

70
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,245
What?

71
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,915
You can't focus because of these punks?
Let these guys teach you a lesson.

72
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,167
Do you know what will happen to them?

73
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,254
They'll just mooch off their parents
like leeches.

74
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,131
They'll become useless scumbags, okay?

75
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,261
This boy says that he sometimes hears
a bleep inside his head.

76
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,851
Gosh!

77
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,270
What the heck?

78
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,027
Hey, is this your way
of rebelling against me?

79
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,113
-What a lunatic.
-I'm sorry.

80
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,489
-What's he doing?
-What?

81
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,202
-Shall I go fill it up again?
-What?

82
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,082
What are you looking at? You punks.

83
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,918
Hey, you'd better watch out.

84
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,795
Gosh, this nutjob...

85
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,881
He got scolded every single day

86
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,467
but never attended
any of the after-school study hours.

87
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,304
He acted like a lunatic from time to time,

88
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,222
but he was a disciplined student.

89
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,767
He never had a friend
throughout high school.

90
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,811
But for some strange reason,
he never seemed lonely.

91
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,485
What are you doing? Go.

92
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,951
Without even realizing it,
I had developed a crush on him.

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,163
Hey, I'm hungry.

94
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,709
"The boy is transferring to another school
next week.

95
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,337
I'm sad.

96
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,591
Shall I tell him how I feel or not?
I'm torn."

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,470
It was a cute story from a girl
who has a crush on her classmate.

98
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,932
I'm not sure
what would be the right choice to make,

99
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,560
but your inner compass usually tells you
what it is that you want to do.

100
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,525
Just like the way you think about the boy,

101
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,986
try to focus on what your heart wants.

102
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,036
She'll give it to him now.

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,124
She's had a crush on him for three years.
Will her love come true today?

104
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,416
Let's see!

105
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,212
Saeroyi.

106
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,299
I heard you're transferring
to another school.

107
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,760
Yes.

108
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,731
The exam for the Police University
is tomorrow, right?

109
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,318
Good luck.

110
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,949
TO SAEROYI

111
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,915
Let's go.

112
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,714
What happened? Why did he just walk away?

113
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,549
Why didn't he take the chocolate?

114
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,471
He doesn't like sweets.

115
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,347
LEE JIN-HUI, CHOI GA-YEONG

116
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,392
I've always known it,
but he's actually crazy.

117
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,437
I know. I mean, can't he just accept it?
He's leaving anyway.

118
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,273
He always does whatever the hell he wants.

119
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,650
That's why

120
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,486
I fell for him.

121
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,911
PAJIN CITY

122
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,427
PAJIN STATION

123
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,655
Hey.

124
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,490
Wait.

125
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,284
Spare some change, please?

126
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,162
Gosh!

127
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,540
Are you all right?

128
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,959
I'll help you up.

129
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,129
Excuse me.

130
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,047
Hey!

131
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,425
Wait.

132
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,805
You're nuts. Walking away
after pushing someone like that.

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,266
He grabbed me, so I shook him off.

134
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,394
Go apologize to him.

135
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,853
He could've gotten hurt.

136
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,356
OH SOO-AH

137
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,276
Are you proud to do a good deed?

138
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,194
What?

139
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,530
Does it make you feel like
you're a good person?

140
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,491
So annoying.

141
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,085
-Seventeen.
-One.

142
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,087
NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY
PHYSICAL TEST

143
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,641
What?

144
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,227
Isn't he the guy who got
a perfect score on the strength training?

145
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,146
He can't really run though.

146
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,107
Yes, I see that.
It looks like he has an injury.

147
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,902
Do you know this?

148
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,571
Do you?

149
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,197
Know what?

150
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,326
You won't pass if you get one point
in anything in the physical evaluation.

151
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,620
You hurt your leg, didn't you?

152
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,582
It doesn't look like either of us
will pass, so why don't you take it easy?

153
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,335
I'll be fine.

154
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,297
Hey, wait! Jeez!

155
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,009
Look at him.

156
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,179
Gosh, he's fierce.

157
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,277
Mr. Park, congratulations
on transferring to the HQ.

158
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,780
My gosh, Ms. Kang.

159
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,700
-It's been a while.
-Gosh, you're at it again.

160
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,203
You're hurting my feelings here.

161
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,205
Just treat me like you used to.

162
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,457
All right. It's good to see you.

163
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,127
I heard you're transferring to Pajin City.
Did the move go well?

164
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,630
I haven't moved yet.
I'll do it on the weekend.

165
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,340
What about Saeroyi?

166
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,759
He'll transfer to Gwangjin High.

167
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,304
Gwangjin High? Geun-won goes there, too.

168
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,391
-The chairman's son?
-Yes.

169
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,310
-What year is Saeroyi in?
-He's a senior.

170
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,563
-Then they're the same age.
-Really?

171
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,359
That little boy is already
a high school senior?

172
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,571
He's actually taking the physical test
for the National Police University today.

173
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,782
Even I'm nervous.

174
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,704
You know, the orphanage.
The one that the company sponsors.

175
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,415
Gaenari Orphanage? What about it?

176
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,916
I'm in charge of it.

177
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,795
We've decided
to pull sponsorship altogether.

178
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,339
What do you mean?

179
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,509
Jangga is the only company
that provides them with meals.

180
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,262
Who's going to feed the kids
if we pull sponsorship?

181
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,265
Remember the documentary
about the elderly that aired recently?

182
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,267
Nursing homes are the thing now.

183
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,185
Are we just after media attention?

184
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,187
I told you. Business is all about people.

185
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,025
Who is it?
Who made such a foolish decision?

186
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,195
The chairman.

187
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,035
But what he's thinking is obvious,
you know.

188
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,546
Shall I rebel against him
if it bothers you that much?

189
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,256
Forget it, Ms. Kang.

190
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,216
We have no choice.

191
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,302
It's unnecessary to get on his wrong side.

192
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,180
Like you said, it's a business after all.

193
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,072
TEST IDENTIFICATION SLIP
PARK SAEROYI

194
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,366
SIT-UP, PUSH-UP, 1,000M SPRINT,
STANDING LONG JUMP

195
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,996
Is your leg okay?

196
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,999
I passed the physical test, you know.
It's totally fine.

197
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,294
Aren't you sad about leaving your friends?

198
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,421
No, it's okay. I don't have any friends.

199
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,218
Right, I heard the chairman's son
goes to the school you're transferring to.

200
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,469
He's the same age as you.

201
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,514
I hope you guys are in the same class.

202
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,432
What's his name?

203
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,476
Jang Geun-won.

204
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,730
-Do I have to get along with him?
-If you guys click.

205
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,401
He's the chairman's son.
I guess I have to get along with him.

206
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,906
Goodness.
As if you care about things like that.

207
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
Try to get along with your classmates.

208
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,495
Reading over your school records
hurt my feelings a little.

209
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,000
Because it says that I'm "socially inept"?

210
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,168
That's right.

211
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,296
Even to me,
you seem a little socially awkward.

212
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,299
Don't be so hardheaded.

213
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,510
It'll only make your life more difficult.

214
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,180
What? You said our family motto is,
"Never compromise your principles."

215
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,974
What do you want me to do?

216
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,893
I'm not sure.

217
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,316
By the way, where are we going?

218
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,861
PAJIN GAENARI ORPHANAGE

219
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,119
I'll give you yummy snacks.

220
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,497
-Here.
-Thank you.

221
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,165
-You should share it.
-Thank you.

222
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,751
This is so random.

223
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,545
Why bring me
to an orphanage out of the blue?

224
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,505
Why not?

225
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,633
You said we were going
to finish packing up our stuff.

226
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,468
Come on, seriously.

227
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,721
We can pack anytime.

228
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,472
Hey, go hang those.

229
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,516
-Okay.
-Mr. Park!

230
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,227
Mr. Park.

231
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,356
Hi, Soo-ah.
You're getting prettier by the day.

232
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,278
What?

233
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,906
Mr. Park, is he your son?

234
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes.

235
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,409
He is. Say hi.

236
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,869
I'll go hang clean laundry.

237
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,079
Her name is... What's with him?

238
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,141
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,313
I heard from the director.

240
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,523
It's not your fault though.

241
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,859
You have to listen to your boss.

242
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,112
But now that I live close by,

243
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,365
I'll visit often to cook for you.

244
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,950
Really?

245
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,829
I was worried about not being able to eat
your food again, not the sponsorship.

246
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,791
Thank you.

247
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,292
You don't need to thank me.

248
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,045
I'm grateful
you've grown into a good girl.

249
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,261
By the way,
your son is very different from you.

250
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,766
He's kind of cold and shy, isn't he?

251
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm not talking about that.
He's pretty good-looking.

252
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,773
Really? I think he got that from me.

253
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,370
Hey.

254
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,207
So you're transferring to Gwangjin High?

255
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,334
I go to Gwangjin High, too.

256
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,211
Which class?

257
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,805
I'm trying to befriend you here.
Can't you cooperate?

258
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,515
Why do you want to befriend me?

259
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,684
Because you're Mr. Park's son.

260
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
-Are you and my dad close?
-Yes.

261
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,690
Has it been about five years?

262
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,608
He works at Jangga Co., you know?

263
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,945
The company sponsors our orphanage,
and he's in charge of it.

264
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,704
Why is this still so wet?

265
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,540
Gosh, you really are socially inept.

266
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,878
Is it because of that incident?

267
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,880
You were so annoying.

268
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,509
Is it annoying to help those
in need of help?

269
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,554
How is it different
from my dad helping you?

270
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,351
Right, I take back what I said.

271
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,645
I guess we can't be friends.

272
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,029
Hey, you brought this.

273
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,323
You like doing good deeds.

274
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,784
Hang them all by yourself.

275
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,951
That little...

276
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,878
Take good care of yourself.

277
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,047
-You, too.
-Will do.

278
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,633
Hey!

279
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,885
Hey! Come out and say bye.

280
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,350
Try to understand. He's not that social.

281
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,851
I can see that.

282
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,311
Maybe you coddled him too much.

283
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,690
Bye. Drive safely.

284
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,193
Call me if anything happens.
I'll be off, then.

285
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,638
Food is ready.

286
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,975
This looks so good.

287
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,185
Thanks, son.

288
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,104
Enjoy.

289
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,983
Hey, this is your first day
at your new school.

290
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,569
I'm worried because you haven't bought
your new uniform yet.

291
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,739
Shall I make some time in the morning
and pick it up?

292
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,033
No, it's your first day at the HQ.

293
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,827
I'll just wear this today.

294
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,955
-Sure, if you're okay with that.
-Yes.

295
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:33,547
Your cooking skills are getting better
by the day. This is delicious.

296
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,507
I guess I got that from you.

297
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,055
You need to season this again.
It's not edible.

298
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,642
I made it bland on purpose.

299
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,352
It's too bland.

300
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,156
BUS STOP

301
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,798
-Geun-won.
-Get in. I'll give you a ride.

302
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,800
The bus will be here shortly.

303
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,136
Why take the bus?
Enjoy the comfortable ride.

304
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,597
I'll be uncomfortable.

305
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,728
Let's go.

306
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,434
GWANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

307
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,315
Be quiet.

308
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,237
Attention, everyone.

309
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,989
We have a new student.

310
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,658
You won't have time to make friends
since you're seniors.

311
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,368
But don't be mean to him.

312
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,453
And make sure you get along
until you graduate, okay?

313
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,038
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

314
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,915
You should introduce yourself.

315
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,251
Oh, okay.

316
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,135
Hello, my name is Park Saeroyi.
Nice to meet you.

317
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,386
-Gosh.
-Come on.

318
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,889
Tell us what you want to become
and what your hobby is.

319
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,683
Oh, right.

320
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,063
I want to become

321
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,857
a police officer.

322
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,736
And I enjoy listening to music

323
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,697
and running.

324
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,199
Okay, I guess that's it.
Give him a round of applause.

325
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,078
You can sit...

326
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,706
There's an empty seat.

327
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,377
You can sit there.

328
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,465
You guys can study while I go
to the teachers' room. Don't chat.

329
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,091
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

330
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,210
Come on, you loser.

331
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,881
Are you crazy? My gosh, seriously.

332
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:05,967
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry.

333
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,097
Don't you know that I hate white milk?

334
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,307
Tell me.

335
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,270
The snack bar was out of strawberry milk.
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,567
My gosh, you little loser.
Let me look at you.

337
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,278
Hey.

338
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,448
If the snack bar was
out of strawberry milk,

339
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,243
you could've gone outside
and bought one at the supermarket.

340
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,911
Hey, look.

341
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,704
Look at me.

342
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,375
Look at how handsome you look.
Let me take a photo.

343
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,709
-Forget it.
-Stand straight.

344
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,837
What are you going to do?

345
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,174
-It's making me feel uncomfortable.
-Smile.

346
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,176
You should know when not to interfere.

347
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,179
Don't you know who he is?
He's Jang Geun-won.

348
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,682
He's your dad's boss' son.

349
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,475
My gosh, turn left.

350
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,019
Don't you know which way is left
and which way is right?

351
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,272
One, two, three.

352
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,731
-So?
-Say, "cheese."

353
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,109
What do you mean?

354
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,444
He's the successor of Jangga Co.
He's the chairman's son.

355
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,823
If you get on his bad side,
it won't do your dad any good.

356
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,408
Let me take a photo.

357
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,493
That's your reason?

358
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,413
What?

359
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,708
-Will you smile already?
-Hey.

360
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,836
Open your eyes, you punk. Open...

361
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,422
That's enough.

362
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,136
Just because you're rich

363
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,305
doesn't mean you can be an asshole.

364
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,398
"Asshole"?

365
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,821
He must be crazy.

366
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:52,782
My gosh.

367
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,744
He's a real hero, isn't he?

368
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,163
Don't you agree?

369
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,623
Hey.

370
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,336
Yes?

371
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,713
What?

372
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,348
You look like you have a temper.
You must be a pretty good fighter.

373
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,725
-Am I correct?
-Stop it.

374
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,231
Do you want to know the school rule?

375
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,948
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

376
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,991
The homeroom teacher's here.

377
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,410
Hey, loser.

378
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,206
Let's carry on a bit later.

379
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,334
LEE HO-JIN

380
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,004
Sir, don't you see this?

381
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,507
What? Well...

382
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,803
That's enough messing around.
Get ready for class.

383
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,221
Yes, sir.

384
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,480
Do what the teacher says.

385
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,148
Do you get it now?

386
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,612
The school rule.

387
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,074
Jang Geun-won

388
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,659
is the law around here.

389
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,767
You're crazy.

390
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,394
Geun-won!

391
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,062
Geun-won.

392
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,327
Most of the stew made by Jangga Co.
are seasoned

393
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,121
with this special sauce.
Why don't you have a taste?

394
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,293
How does it taste?

395
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,379
The spiciness is just the right amount,
and it's very savory. Don't you agree?

396
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:15,175
-Yes, it's delicious.
-It's very savory.

397
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,763
This sauce played a great role
in the development of our company.

398
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,725
The chairman came up
with the recipe himself.

399
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,227
-He came up with it himself?
-Impressive, right?

400
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,646
I really like the color.

401
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,025
My goodness. Long time no see, Mr. Kim.

402
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,736
You need to come outside for a bit.

403
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:36,905
What?

404
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,868
My gosh. This is what you do
on your first day of school?

405
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,204
How dare you beat up a friend

406
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,207
in front of a teacher?

407
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,085
Are you a gangster?

408
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,215
Geun-won, are you okay?

409
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,176
Do I look okay to you?

410
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,055
-He broke my nose.
-I'm really sorry about what happened.

411
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,141
I shouldn't have accepted that punk.

412
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,992
-Sir, you're here.
-Dad.

413
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,955
I'm sorry about all this.

414
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,374
Get up, you punk.

415
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,068
Mr. Park.

416
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,821
I heard he's your son.

417
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,866
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

418
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,368
What?

419
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,495
He's your son?

420
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,999
My dad's employee's son
had the guts to hit me?

421
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,834
Behave yourself in front of the adults.

422
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm...

423
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,255
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,675
I'm sorry about that.
My son was very rude.

425
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,012
No, it's okay, sir.

426
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,852
Your name is Saeroyi?

427
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,816
-Principal.
-Yes, sir?

428
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,361
What's going to happen to him?

429
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,949
We'll follow the school rules
and have him expelled.

430
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:49,537
And the police will help you
come to a settlement.

431
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,081
The police doesn't need
to get involved in this.

432
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,209
Mr. Park and I

433
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,254
have known each other for a long time,
so settling things won't be an issue.

434
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,301
But

435
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,055
school rules are different.

436
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,892
What do you say?

437
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,811
Pardon?

438
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,229
Will he be able to stay in school

439
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,315
if we decide to forgive him?

440
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,695
Yes, of course. If you forgive him,

441
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,699
we'll give him a good scolding
and make sure this never happens again.

442
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,577
Okay.

443
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,205
Let's not cause a fuss.

444
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,709
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

445
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,463
That's enough.
You're an important member of the company.

446
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,590
Thank you, sir.

447
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,802
I'll make sure this never happens again.

448
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,059
But...

449
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,563
Saeroyi.

450
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,569
It's important that you know
how to apologize for your mistakes.

451
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,615
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize for what you did.

452
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,451
That's how we'll settle this.

453
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,751
But sir, that's...

454
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,044
Mr. Park.

455
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,464
My eldest son got beaten up.

456
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,968
It makes me feel very uneasy
to be in this situation.

457
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,763
So I'm offering a solution
that will enable me to tolerate this.

458
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,474
We need to wrap this up anyway.

459
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,938
What do you think,

460
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,857
Saeroyi?

461
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,664
If you do something wrong,

462
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,293
it's only right that you get punished.

463
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,962
That's what my dad taught me.

464
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,882
That's right.

465
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,552
Mr. Park, you're a great father.
You taught him well.

466
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,432
But my dad

467
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,477
also taught me

468
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,897
that one must stick to their beliefs.

469
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,698
I saw one of my classmates get bullied.

470
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,868
And the teacher condoned that.

471
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,621
I never bullied anyone, you jerk.

472
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,831
It made me feel uneasy,
so I tried to stop him.

473
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,254
But he didn't listen, so I hit him.

474
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,136
I shouldn't have hit him
in front of the teacher no matter what.

475
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,103
I deserve to get punished
for what I did wrong.

476
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,813
Saeroyi...

477
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,523
But...

478
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,069
I can't apologize to Geun-won.

479
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,116
Because

480
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,827
I don't feel sorry at all.

481
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,670
So you refuse to get on your knees

482
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,799
-even if you could get expelled?
-I'm doing what I think is right.

483
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,052
That's what my dad taught me.

484
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,974
And I wish to continue living like that.

485
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,656
How unfortunate.

486
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,538
You leave me with no choice.

487
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,918
Mr. Park, what do you think?

488
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,297
Why are you so quiet?

489
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,056
He's still just a child
who doesn't know the ways of the world.

490
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,852
It's hard to believe that he's my son.

491
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,571
I'm amazed by him.

492
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,126
He's doing what he thinks is right

493
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,295
and is willing to be responsible.

494
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,548
So...

495
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,968
So I have

496
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,889
nothing more to say to you, sir.

497
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,188
You're being a fool.

498
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,525
How are you going to keep
working at the company

499
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,778
now that things are awkward between us?

500
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,571
Wait. This is my--

501
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,532
I'll resign, sir.

502
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,408
Dad.

503
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,046
Okay then.

504
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,257
You do that.

505
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,220
Thank you so much

506
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,306
for everything, sir.

507
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,413
Enjoy.

508
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,127
Whatever the reason,

509
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,754
violence can never be justified.

510
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,008
You did something you shouldn't have done,

511
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,302
and you got punished for that.

512
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,889
What about you, Dad?

513
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,603
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you resigning?

514
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,982
Just like your beliefs,

515
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,195
I also have my own beliefs as a father.

516
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,116
Can you drink?

517
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,246
I'm a student. I shouldn't drink.

518
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,707
You're not a student anymore.

519
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,051
Pour me a glass.

520
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,016
Hold the bottle with your right hand,
and make sure you cover the label.

521
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,185
Lightly support it with your left hand.

522
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,728
Good.

523
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,235
Don't fill up the entire glass.
Just a little more than half.

524
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,028
Okay, that's good.

525
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,115
Okay then. Let's have a drink.

526
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,748
Turn your head slightly to the side
when you drink.

527
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,334
Yes, that's right.

528
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,177
How does it taste?

529
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,975
It's sweet.

530
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,852
My goodness.

531
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,233
That means you had
a very impressive day today.

532
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,167
I know I'm not a student anymore.

533
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,129
But I'm still a minor.
Are you allowed to teach me this?

534
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,173
Dads are supposed to teach their sons
how to drink.

535
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,932
It's sweet for me too.

536
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,916
I'm really sorry.

537
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,633
This will all just be a memory
once time passes by.

538
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,345
You can take the GED

539
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,722
to replace your diploma.

540
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,099
And I have enough money

541
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,728
to start a small restaurant of my own.

542
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
But that's not what's important.

543
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,821
I know I always told you
to stick to your beliefs.

544
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,866
But I failed to do that myself.

545
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,163
Unlike myself,

546
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,957
I wanted you to be proud and confident.

547
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,254
And today, I could see

548
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,468
you were already living like that.

549
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,601
You have no idea how proud I was.

550
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,776
I want you to keep
living like that, my son.

551
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,867
-Hey, look!
-What is it?

552
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,538
Geun-won got a car
after he got his driver's license.

553
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,498
I can't believe he drove it here.

554
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,667
But I bet the teacher won't scold him.

555
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,842
2006 GWANGJIN UNIVERSITY
ROLLING ADMISSION FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS

556
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,803
The rolling admission exam
for Gwangjin University is next week.

557
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,931
Did you study hard?

558
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,601
Yes, I guess.

559
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,945
ANNOUNCEMENT

560
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,238
Aren't you coming?

561
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,407
Right. Let's go.

562
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,164
PARK SAEROYI, CLASS 3-1, EXPELLED

563
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,255
Isn't it beautiful?

564
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,010
Yes, it's pretty.

565
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,722
You have good taste.
This is a limited edition.

566
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,267
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

567
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,313
It's really hard to get this number,
but the dealer helped me get it.

568
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,359
-That's great.
-Are you on your way home?

569
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,860
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

570
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,403
Maybe next time.

571
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,239
What's with the cold shoulder?

572
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,372
Is something bothering you?

573
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,582
You think?

574
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,376
Oh, right.

575
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,879
I heard my dad's company stopped
sponsoring the orphanage.

576
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,839
Don't worry about it.

577
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,841
I'll ask my dad to change his mind.

578
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,263
That's not what this is about.

579
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,306
The kids won't starve because of that.

580
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,907
That will be 3,000 won.
Do you have a discount or point card?

581
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,950
No.

582
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,412
Thank you. Goodbye.

583
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,543
Mr. Park.

584
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,629
What do you plan to do?

585
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,048
What? What do you mean?

586
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,467
I heard you got fired.

587
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,387
I didn't get fired. I quit.

588
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,973
What's the difference?

589
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,434
My gosh, stop worrying

590
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,477
and just focus on
getting into a university.

591
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,063
By the way, did you pay for my tuition?

592
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,482
-What?
-The orphanage director told me

593
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,401
that you paid for my tuition.

594
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,237
You're starting to nag again.

595
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,822
Let me eat.

596
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:40,075
My gosh, I finally get
where he got that nosiness from.

597
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,785
What? Who are you talking about?

598
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,330
Who do you think?
I'm talking about your son.

599
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,206
He's just like you.

600
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,459
Why are you in such a bad mood today?

601
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,835
Did something bad happen?

602
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,672
Yes, you got fired.

603
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,091
You and your son are unbelievable.

604
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,636
I'm never going to live like you guys.

605
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,096
You call yourself a cook,

606
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,682
but you're eating instant noodles.

607
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:08,604
Well, I do hope you end up
living a better life.

608
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,691
I haven't even taken
my rolling admission exam yet.

609
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,942
What if I flunk the exam?

610
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,696
You're a smart girl.

611
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,199
If you fail this year,
you'll get in next year.

612
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,242
Says the guy who got fired.

613
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,036
How are you going to make a living?

614
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,458
You have no idea how proud I am.

615
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:34,046
That wild little girl grew up to be
such a magnificent person.

616
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,344
You should go to university.

617
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,513
You can succeed

618
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,973
and pay me back twofold.

619
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,064
Then...

620
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,650
Then let's say I borrowed that money.

621
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:59,196
I'll succeed and pay you back
three times the amount.

622
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,281
Okay, deal.

623
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,202
Do you have any leftover gimbaps?

624
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,705
Do you have any that passed
the expiry date?

625
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,500
What about the ones
that expired yesterday?

626
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,008
I heard what happened to Mr. Park.

627
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,929
Yes, he was your mentor, wasn't he?

628
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,224
I know you guys were very close.

629
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,770
Yes, he was also very close
with my late father.

630
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:37,192
And from what I know,
he was very close with you, too.

631
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,029
That doesn't matter
when it comes to running a company.

632
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,284
You of all people know
that Mr. Park is very smart and competent.

633
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,119
He played a very big role in...

634
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,133
He disobeyed me.

635
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,637
He was a very loyal dog.

636
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,807
But what do you think happens
when an old and useless dog

637
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,643
fails to recognize its owner?

638
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,645
Sir.

639
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,025
Personally speaking,

640
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,570
I'm a very authoritative person.

641
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,863
Do you know why?

642
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,743
Your father and I started out
with a small pub

643
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,037
and was able to build Jangga Co.
after so much hard work.

644
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,248
And all the decisions I made
throughout that journey

645
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,627
were correct.

646
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,345
I think of you like my own daughter.

647
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,348
But please don't provoke me too much.

648
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,536
Just a second, sir.

649
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,872
-Where's my wallet?
-It's okay. Just get in.

650
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,501
My test ID.

651
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,598
Hey.

652
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,225
Hey!

653
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,688
I thought today was your interview

654
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,231
for the rolling admission.

655
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,233
Where are you going?

656
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,318
You already know where.

657
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,654
Why aren't you taking the bus?

658
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,157
I forgot to bring my test ID and ID card.

659
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,576
I'm so stupid.

660
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,785
What are you going to do?

661
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,037
Will you stop asking me?

662
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,206
I told you that I messed up.

663
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,043
But why are you running
instead of taking a bus?

664
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,506
I'll be late for the interview
if I wait for the next bus.

665
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,678
It's fine. I just need to get
to Gwangjin University in 20 minutes.

666
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,096
Twenty minutes?

667
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,725
That's at least 3km away from here.

668
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,102
Mind your own business.

669
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,732
Wait.

670
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,152
You won't be able to make it at this pace.

671
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,778
Just mind your own business.

672
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,071
Try to keep up with me.

673
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,489
Can you do that?

674
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,491
I can do it.

675
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,250
Hang in there. We're almost there.

676
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,796
Why are you helping me?

677
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,340
I thought you hated me.

678
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,760
Don't be absurd.

679
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,345
Now, breathe. Slowly.

680
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,765
Come on.

681
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,659
I told you I can make it on my own.

682
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,702
Okay, whatever.

683
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,914
We're almost there.

684
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,980
Soo-ah.

685
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,902
Good luck on your interview.

686
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,406
Gosh, you don't need to worry.

687
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,199
I'll do well.

688
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,585
LIST OF APPLICANTS

689
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,464
Numbers 21 to 25, please come inside.

690
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,185
Soo-ah.

691
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,730
Good luck on your interview.

692
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,946
GWANGJIN UNIVERSITY

693
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,591
What are you doing here?

694
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,719
Were you waiting for me?

695
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,140
Well...

696
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,602
How was the interview? Did you do well?

697
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,396
Yes, thanks to you.

698
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,566
Why did you wait?

699
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,702
Do you still

700
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,831
want to be friends because of my dad?

701
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,290
Because I do.

702
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,549
Can't we be friends?

703
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,178
We can be friends.

704
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,819
Why do you want to be friends with me?

705
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,238
You don't like me.

706
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,284
No reason.

707
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,872
I used to think you were a girl
with no heart.

708
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,125
But I think I might know
why you were being like that.

709
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,505
Why do you think I'm like this?

710
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,840
Because you're twisted.

711
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,760
Are you sure you want to be my friend?

712
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,181
You don't like to receive help, do you?

713
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,893
And you don't like people asking for help.

714
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,937
"I'm nothing like as bad as the person.

715
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,731
There are people going through worse.

716
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,025
I should rather be grateful."

717
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,737
Do you know what sympathy is?

718
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,781
It's a distasteful emotion
where you look down on someone

719
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,825
and get comfort from it.

720
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,709
What about my dad?

721
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,545
Was it also a sympathy
that's just distasteful?

722
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,716
He's different.

723
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,385
How is he different?

724
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,554
You don't have to know.

725
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,780
By the way, the fact that
you hit Jang Geun-won the other day.

726
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,198
Do you not regret it?

727
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,784
What?

728
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,330
Even when Geun-won did something wrong,

729
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,123
no one could stop him.

730
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,501
Even teachers were no different.

731
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,838
But you made a huge scene as soon
as you transferred from another school.

732
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,010
That was cool.

733
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,850
But you ended up
getting expelled from school.

734
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,980
I can't live like you or your dad.

735
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,232
And that's not what I want.

736
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,405
Why did you have to bring that up?

737
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,364
No reason.

738
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,907
I'm just saying.

739
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,452
It's getting cold. Let's go.

740
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,039
Wait.

741
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,422
What was that? Do you have a cell phone?

742
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,049
What's going on?

743
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,678
I told you. I want to be your friend.

744
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,934
Give me your phone.
I'll give you my number.

745
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,319
I'm giving my number
because we're friends.

746
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,698
You shouldn't have a crush on me.

747
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,283
What?

748
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,492
Here. This is my number.

749
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,667
So this is it.

750
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,294
Why can't I have a crush on you?

751
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,758
A stubborn guy like you
gives a girl a hard time.

752
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,720
Okay?

753
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,723
You shouldn't fall for me.

754
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,020
Why aren't you answering me?

755
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,274
We never know...

756
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,612
what will happen in life.

757
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,530
Give me. I can't do this.

758
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,657
You can't take it back from me.

759
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,367
I'll get going. I'll call you.

760
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,495
-Hey, Saeroyi.
-Oh, right.

761
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,748
You...

762
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,339
You're cool enough.

763
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,512
And you're very pretty.

764
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,934
I should get going. See you.

765
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,312
Hey! Delete my number!

766
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,545
You seem to be in a good mood.

767
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,964
What? Of course I am.

768
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,425
I've always dreamed
of running my own business.

769
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,470
My heart is pounding with anticipation.

770
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,059
By the way, what's the name of the pub?

771
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,644
Well...

772
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,730
What about Saeroyi Pub?

773
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,358
I don't like it. It sounds silly.

774
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,821
We still have some time
until we open the place.

775
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,450
You should come up with a decent name.

776
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,083
I got expelled from school.

777
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,963
My dad got fired.

778
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,801
It was no big deal.

779
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,556
There was no change in my daily life.

780
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,226
-I did it.
-It worked.

781
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,352
-I really did it.
-Right.

782
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,314
Having many different feelings,

783
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,901
I just live from day to day.

784
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,863
Hey, come here.

785
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,452
Go ahead and do it now.

786
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,537
All right. Let's drink.

787
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,580
I'm still young,

788
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,831
You guys should drink water.

789
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,209
but I think this is life.

790
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,044
Bottoms up!

791
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,588
I have these silly thoughts

792
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,007
that my dad might laugh at.

793
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,717
How does the water taste?

794
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,093
It's great.

795
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,534
Sure. I bought everything we need.

796
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,411
Yes. I bought meat, too.

797
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,705
The color looks amazing.

798
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,874
I'll be right there.

799
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,168
Okay, son.

800
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,623
As long as we're alive,

801
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,086
nothing is a big deal.

802
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,882
As long as we are alive.

803
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,979
I have to survive.

804
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,739
My son...

805
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,651
That night,

806
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,987
Dad didn't come back.

807
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,812
I'm sorry.

808
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,676
What are you thinking about?

809
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,850
You got expelled

810
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,103
on the first day in the new school.

811
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,317
I don't have to buy the uniform.

812
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,319
The uniform.

813
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,467
You might end up passing out.

814
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,928
You should force yourself to eat.

815
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,604
It's strange,

816
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,525
but all I can remember is
what I've gotten.

817
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,699
I just took it for granted.

818
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,122
Why did I take it for granted?

819
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,460
I must've been crazy.

820
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,346
Mr. Park Saeroyi.

821
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:36,145
I'm sorry to bother you
at a time like this.

822
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,649
I'm Detective Oh Byung-heon
in charge of your father's case.

823
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,692
The suspect

824
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,028
turned himself in this morning.

825
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:50,618
I think you should know
the circumstances of the case.

826
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,080
These are the photos of the scene.

827
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,874
The suspect wants to reach a settlement.

828
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,586
A settlement?

829
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,547
In a case like this...

830
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,756
So you mean

831
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,010
he wants

832
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,055
to measure the value

833
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,642
of my dad's life?

834
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,315
So this guy

835
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,361
wants to pay me for that?

836
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,490
I'm sorry for your loss, but...

837
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,205
Saeroyi, are you all right?

838
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:46,215
Sir, he hasn't slept or eaten
for the past two days.

839
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:50,845
Do you mind visiting him sometime later?

840
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,599
I'm really sorry for what happened.

841
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,602
Please get some rest and give us a call.

842
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,521
Let's go.

843
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,491
You should get some rest.

844
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,246
Otherwise, you might collapse soon.

845
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,499
I'm sorry.

846
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,803
What...

847
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,014
This...

848
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,142
Why is it here?

849
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,190
This car.

850
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,903
-Why?
-Why is it here?

851
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,074
You have good taste.
This is a limited edition.

852
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,369
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

853
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,996
It's really hard to get this number.

854
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,002
This is Jang Geun-won's car.

855
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,133
Are you sure?

856
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,395
Are you sure it's Jang Geun-won's car?

857
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,401
Yes.

858
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,611
He said it's a limited edition.

859
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,781
And I'm sure this is his number.

860
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:47,920
Saeroyi.

861
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,506
I'm sorry. Will you
excuse me for a second?

862
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,510
Saeroyi.

863
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,262
Saeroyi!

864
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,059
Saeroyi, wait.

865
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,270
What are you going to do?

866
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,982
Let's calm down
and call the police first...

867
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,638
What is he doing here?

868
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,223
He's Saeroyi.

869
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,728
-What's going on?
-Why is he here?

870
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,733
Family.

871
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,487
Dad.

872
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,866
Even before I realized his favor
that I can't return,

873
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,370
I lost the one.

874
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,538
GWANGJIN HOSPITAL

875
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,384
The one was like my everything.

876
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,556
It broke my heart
because he only cared about me.

877
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,227
And that's why I could try hard.

878
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,065
To me, you were

879
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,693
the reason for my existence, Dad.

880
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:19,864
Saeroyi.

881
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,702
It's important that you know
how to apologize for your mistakes.

882
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,747
That's what I heard.

883
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,919
But he took my everything.

884
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,214
What are you doing?

885
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,801
How did you...

886
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,097
Now that you seem startled,
it's just obvious.

887
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,434
Wait. Hang on a second.

888
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:54,023
It's you, right?

889
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:58,944
Wait.

890
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,573
Let's talk it out. Calm down.

891
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,368
Why did you not call the hospital?

892
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,745
No.

893
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:09,997
It's not like that. Let's talk it out.
Let this go.

894
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,795
Why is someone else being punished?

895
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,631
Help!

896
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,009
Help me!

897
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,975
Hang on. Wait and just listen to me.

898
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,270
You jerk.

899
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,815
Why did you kill my dad?

900
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,363
Why?

901
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,535
I'm sorry.

902
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:50,871
I'm really sorry.

903
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,717
Please stop. I'm so sorry.

904
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:09,932
It's too late.

905
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:15,980
The one who should receive the apology

906
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:18,983
is dead.

907
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,364
Wait. Please don't do this.

908
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,492
You killed him.

909
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,328
You have to

910
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,372
go apologize to him.

911
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,460
You have to die!

912
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:40,796
Die!

913
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,173
Go ahead and die!

914
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:47,678
Die! Die, you jerk!

915
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:49,972
Damn it.

916
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,600
You son of a bitch.

917
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,678
Die, you jerk!

918
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,183
SPECIAL THANKS TO SON HYUN-JOO

919
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,861
