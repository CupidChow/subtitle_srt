DANBAM

5
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,610
I want to work here.

6
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,614
What do you mean? You want to work here?

7
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,491
Yes.

8
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,412
Thanks for the offer,
but I've already found someone.

9
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,457
Sorry?

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,419
Yi-seo.

11
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,130
Geun-soo?

12
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,049
What brings you here?

13
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,718
What's going on?
What the heck are you doing here?

14
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,558
He's going to work here from now on.

15
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,018
That's right.

16
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,272
What?

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,238
ELEVEN YEARS AGO

18
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,908
My brother got beaten up
by someone at school.

19
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,326
Say hi, will you?

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,206
He needed someone
to take his anger out on, so he hit me.

21
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,963
I was born out of wedlock.

22
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,594
What happened to your face?

23
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,013
I think he and Geun-won fought.

24
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,853
When is the meeting
with Minister Kim?

25
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,479
It's at 5:00 p.m., sir.

26
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,025
My birth was an accident.

27
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,033
Mom.

28
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,243
My gosh.

29
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,745
What happened?
Did you fight with someone?

30
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,497
Geun-won hit me.

31
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,711
Don't fight. Try to get along with him.

32
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,505
Where are you going?

33
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,341
I'm going shopping
to take a look at some new stuff!

34
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,136
I was

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,972
never loved by anyone.

36
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,268
-Seventeen years went by like that.
-So you want to attend

37
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,729
a high school in Seoul?

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,523
By yourself?

39
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,983
Yes.

THE STRONG PREY ON THE WEAK

42
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,241
"The strong prey on the weak."

43
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,119
It's the fundamental law of this world.

44
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,497
This is my all-time favorite saying.

45
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,583
It suits you.

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,586
Is it hard living here?

47
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,671
I'm comfortable here.

48
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,050
-What's there not to like?
-Then why

49
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,594
do you want to leave?

50
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,472
Dad.

51
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,100
No one needs me here,

52
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,437
and I feel the same way. That's all.

53
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,107
You were born out of wedlock.

54
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,526
You're incompetent

55
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,694
and young.

56
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,614
The weak

57
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,283
must rely on the strong to survive.

58
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,995
You should've just gotten a dog instead.

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,082
You idiot.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,752
I won't stop you. Do what you want.

61
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,465
When you don't expect anything,
you don't get disappointed.

62
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,844
If I could move out of here...

BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

64
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,016
...I'd feel free anywhere I go.

65
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,730
I'm doing well.

66
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,066
Without anyone's help.

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,486
All on my own.

68
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,450
You can't take responsibility.

69
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,202
That's why you're a minor.

70
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,413
Kiddie.

71
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,126
I felt like I met a real adult
for the first time in my life.

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,504
He suffered huge damage because of me.

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,215
How could he be like this?

74
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,551
You want to work part-time?

75
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,303
Yes.

76
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,596
I had met him only once,

77
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,516
but it was enough.

78
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,895
I was thinking about hiring
one more part-timer.

79
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,856
But why?

80
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,858
I want to rely on this guy.

81
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,527
I need some spending money.

82
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,113
I inconvenienced him,

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,907
so I want to make up for it.

84
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,536
Okay, then.

85
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,798
What the hell?

86
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,468
You little shit.

87
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,055
How dare you come here?

88
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,391
-Hello.
-Your name is Jang Geun-soo?

89
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,642
Yes.

90
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,063
Say hi. He's Jang Geun-soo,
and he's going to work with us.

91
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,773
Saeroyi.

92
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,151
Well, having a handsome guy around

93
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,320
will brighten up the ambiance.

94
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,405
Why are you staring at me though?

95
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,282
-Are you implying that I'm ugly?
-Yes.

96
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,950
I agree, for the same reason.

97
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,205
He can be your part-time server.
I'll be the manager.

98
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,289
What?

99
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,292
What the hell are you talking about?

100
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,806
-You said your name is Jo Yi-seo.
-Yes.

101
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,599
Our pub isn't big,

102
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,143
and I'm always here,
so we don't need a manager.

103
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,563
But you, as the owner, need help.
That's why you need a manager.

104
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,816
-Jeez, you little piece of--
-Hey, don't.

105
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,527
Sorry.

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,326
What makes you say that?
You think I need help with marketing?

107
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,580
Mr. Scary Face.

108
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,626
Can you bring out
a basic item on the menu?

109
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,088
-What?
-I want to show you why you guys need me.

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,173
Just bring out something.

111
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,301
-You little shit.
-Bring her something. I'm curious.

112
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,470
Okay.

113
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,473
Treat me like a customer, please.

114
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,236
Here you go.

115
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,612
Stop right there.

116
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,365
He's doing something wrong.

117
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,575
Do you know what it is?

118
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,708
His face?

119
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,669
Saeroyi, please.

120
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,048
Well, not necessarily.

121
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,508
Look at his hand.

122
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,637
This filthy hand, which he could've used
to wipe his butt or pick his nose.

123
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,849
Your fingers should not be touching
the inside of the pot.

124
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,518
Basic rule number one.
When you're serving food,

125
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,270
your hands must be on the outside.

126
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,273
She does have a point.

127
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes, she does.

128
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,443
Let's see.

129
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,694
MENU

130
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,571
SOFT TOFU STEW
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK

131
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,287
What is your specialty?

132
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,881
We worked hard for each recipe,
but we don't have a specialty.

133
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,090
It's too disorderly.

134
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,510
I don't know what to order.

135
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,768
PHOTO

136
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,853
Hey, customer. What are you doing now?

137
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,689
There's no decor theme,
but more importantly,

138
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,399
it's too bright here.

139
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,693
What pub uses
fluorescent lights like these?

140
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,155
Make me one of the popular dishes.

141
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,954
Here are your chicken gizzards.

142
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,834
Look at this.

143
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,087
It looks unappetizing.

144
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,507
There's nothing special about it,
and it doesn't look nice.

145
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,759
I wouldn't eat here
even if I lived nearby.

146
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,345
Who'd come all the way to Itaewon
for this?

147
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,189
And it tastes awful.

148
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,235
I want to rinse my mouth with soju.

149
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,703
First, put all the chairs down.

150
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:54,176
You need to think about how people
will move within the space.

151
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,807
Anyway,

152
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,434
that's enough for today.

153
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,185
Agreed.

154
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,479
Think wisely.

155
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,814
What?

156
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,734
I'm like Zhuge Liang.

157
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,236
I'm Merlin and Rayleigh.

158
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,156
Someone you absolutely need.

159
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,784
You didn't need to lift a finger.
I came here voluntarily.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,162
"I'm doing a good enough job.

161
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,623
She's just a 20-year-old kid
who knows nothing."

162
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,584
If you still feel that you don't need me,

163
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,170
then that's fine.

164
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,965
I wouldn't want to work
with such an idiot anyway.

165
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,430
What do you say?
You still don't need me?

166
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,895
All right.

167
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,730
I did find that helpful.

168
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,941
-Then--
-At the moment, I can only hire

169
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,652
four people, including Geun-soo,

170
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,363
based on the floor space
and the expenses.

171
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,406
I admit that you're great,

172
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,575
but I can't hire you
when I'm fully staffed.

173
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,744
I can't afford to pay you.

174
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,331
If you find me helpful and great,
the solution is simple.

175
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,125
-Why don't you get rid of him or--
-Fire someone

176
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,543
just to hire you?

177
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,087
I can't do that.

178
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,386
Why do you want to work here?

179
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,516
My gut tells me I should.

180
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:25,976
Your gut?

181
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,064
I feel like

182
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,025
you're worth the gamble with my life.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,569
My instinct tells me so.

184
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,920
That's interesting.

185
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,797
What?

186
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,430
Listen up, guys.

187
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,432
As of this moment, this girl,

188
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,933
Jo Yi-seo...

189
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,859
is the manager of DanBam.

190
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,204
Hey, applaud.

191
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,679
LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS

192
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,097
Due to the stock purchase,

193
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,267
Ms. Kang Min-jung's shares
went up by 1.2 percent.

194
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,394
So 7.9 percent in total?

195
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,938
KANG MIN-JUNG SHARE PERCENTAGE
7.9128%

196
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,982
What if we add up her supporters' shares?

197
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,567
If we add up everything,

198
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,904
it'll probably be over 25 percent.

199
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,704
I see, 25 percent.

200
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,332
We're number one in the industry.

201
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,792
I have no other intentions.

202
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,252
Still, I think it's a bit much.

203
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,254
Don't overstretch yourself.

204
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,091
I met a good fund manager,
so I made some money in stocks recently.

205
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,719
It's just enough for me to handle.

206
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,765
You don't have an ulterior motive?

207
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,353
Like what?

208
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,167
Look, we can put
at least two more tables here.

209
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,462
We can put more tables this way
for our tight space.

210
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,636
I organized it yesterday. It's all clean.

211
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
We don't need a lot on the menu.

212
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,723
Just have one specialty

213
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,767
and use two or three
overlapping ingredients

214
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,561
to keep losses to a minimum.

215
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,983
Where did you learn to cook?

216
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,944
I didn't really "learn" it.

217
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,405
I could tell.

218
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,324
-What?
-Let me know what you decide on.

219
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,619
Over there.

220
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,537
Jeez.

221
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,372
Don't shake it.

222
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,124
Don't talk. I'm afraid of heights.

223
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,792
-Shall I hang this here?
-Yes.

224
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,898
Should this go here?

225
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,693
Yes. We'll be done sooner than I thought.

226
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,821
Saeroyi got most of the things done
last night.

227
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,949
-Really?
-Yes.

228
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,203
Then he's probably still sleeping.
When will he get here?

229
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,373
No, he's here.
He got here earlier in the day.

230
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,541
Where is he?

231
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,182
How long have you been working?

232
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,934
Hey, you're here.

233
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,852
I'm almost done.

234
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,563
Did you sleep?
What time did you go to bed?

235
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,190
What?

236
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,568
You set up everything last night.
And now, you're working out here.

237
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,529
What are you thinking?
Will you overwork and faint again?

238
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,075
I couldn't fall asleep.

239
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,579
I can't sleep well at night.

240
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,247
I feel nostalgic,

241
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,583
lonely,

242
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,795
and upset.

243
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,467
If you hang them in a row,
it looks boring.

244
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,928
Hang them at different heights.

245
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,263
I see.

246
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,726
Tomorrow is our grand opening.

247
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,269
Yes.

248
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,107
What do you think

249
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,151
will help you sleep better at night?

250
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,536
What do you mean?

251
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,289
I just want you to get better sleep.

252
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,921
You don't need to worry about that.

253
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,807
OPEN D-1, LOOK FORWARD
TO NEW AND IMPROVED DANBAM

254
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,223
JANGGA CO.

255
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,995
You asked for me?

256
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,247
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

257
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,418
What is this?

258
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,837
You're already 30.

259
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,798
NAME SEO JEONG-IN
WORKS AT JEA FOODS

260
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,175
Dad.

261
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,385
Her father owns Jea Foods.
You should meet her.

262
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,221
But...

263
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,891
I want to date someone naturally.

264
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,603
You lunatic.

265
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,147
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

266
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,024
Do you not want the company?

267
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,820
Do you think it'll just become yours
when I die?

268
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,740
It has nothing to do with that.

269
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,576
Are you aware of your position
within the company?

270
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,662
All you do is cause trouble.

271
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,539
You're nothing other than being my son.

272
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,916
So marry into the Jea Foods family
at least.

273
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,877
-But Dad--
-I don't want to hear it.

274
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,672
Just do as I say.

275
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,052
Leave.

276
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,191
Meet someone naturally?

277
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,611
He's so immature.

278
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,115
I've been observing him for a long time,

279
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,702
and I think he has a crush on Ms. Oh.

280
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,204
What?

281
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,796
Yi-seo!

282
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,801
-Headed to DanBam?
-Yes.

283
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,554
What's with the mask?

284
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,097
Are you sick?

285
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,558
Look at the sky.

286
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,395
Do you want one?
The fine dust levels are bad today.

287
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,608
We still have time until we open.
Why are you going so early?

288
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,946
It's our first day.
There are so many things to check.

289
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,408
-You're working so hard.
-I always work hard.

290
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,912
Well, has your mom said anything?

291
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,872
About what?

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,916
You working instead of going to college.

293
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,877
Knowing your mom, she would throw a fit.

294
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,006
Don't stick your nose
into others' family affairs.

295
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,050
To be honest, I've been curious.

296
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,261
You make enough money
through your blog.

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,014
Why would you give up
on going to college to work?

298
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,644
Then why do you work at DanBam?

299
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,190
I just didn't want to keep feeling
indebted to Saeroyi.

300
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,444
And you think your dad
died because of me, right?

301
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:44,451
Do you even know what kind of relationship
your brother has with him?

302
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,746
What?
Do you know something that I don't know?

303
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,667
Forget it. I shouldn't stick my nose
into your family matters.

304
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,380
Jeez, you still manage to be obnoxious
year after year.

305
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,051
Hold on. Come to think of it,
it's quite fascinating.

306
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,013
What did Saeroyi see in you
that he hired you as the manager?

307
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,224
My gut instinct.

308
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,393
Your gut instinct?

309
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,853
So you hired her for the same reason?

310
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,065
You hired her
just because of your gut instinct

311
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,566
and even made her the manager?

312
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
She's just a 20-year-old kid.

313
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,281
My gut instinct told me
that it'd be a good investment.

314
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,616
You're weird sometimes.

315
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,661
Shall I say I'm convinced?

316
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,997
What was it like to work with her?

317
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,957
Well, she is rude.

318
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,918
-But she knows what she's doing.
-I agree.

319
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,337
But I don't think she likes me.

320
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,465
Right, she hates you
because you two are like peas in a pod.

321
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,883
You're so obnoxious too.

322
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,262
I see. I should make a tofu dish
for dinner because you hate it.

323
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,515
Should I beat you up and go to jail?

324
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,976
-Go ahead and beat me up.
-Everyone's here.

325
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,353
Hello.

326
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,063
Hi, speak of the devil.

327
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,774
Everyone's here now,
so shall we get started?

328
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,693
I want to say something.

329
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,111
May I?

330
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:02,946
Sure.

331
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,952
Let's put our hands together
for a little pep talk.

332
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,245
Hands?

333
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,372
Jeez, forget it. Just say it.

334
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,499
The manager is telling us.
Come on.

335
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,590
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

336
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,889
Thank you for everything.

337
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,225
It mustn't have been easy
to trust and listen to a 20-year-old.

338
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,853
But you've all been patiently following
my lead.

339
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,024
I assure you that we'll be rewarded
for all our hard work.

340
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:46,823
Now, we'll rule Itaewon.

341
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,951
Put your hand up. DanBam.

342
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,120
-We got this!
-We got this!

343
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,663
DanBam Pub's grand opening.

344
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,208
DanBam in Itaewon is back,
new and improved.

345
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,335
I bet you want to know what's new.

346
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,296
We expanded
to be able to accept more customers.

347
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,882
If you haven't been yet,
visit us before it's too late.

348
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:04,883
It's finally open.

349
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,510
-He's hot.
-Let's go this weekend.

350
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,261
I took a picture with Yi-seo.

351
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,889
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

352
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,809
I want this.

353
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,937
I'm so excited.

354
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,230
DANBAM

355
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,523
WANNA GET TIPSY TONIGHT

356
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,525
STEAMED SQUID
SPICY STIR-FRIED PORK

357
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,926
DANBAM

358
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,476
DANBAM

359
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,649
Let me know if you need anything.

360
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,333
DANBAM

361
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,793
TOTAL SALES: 3,200,000 WON

362
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,174
This was our first day.
How did this happen?

363
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:30,343
Yi-seo posted about our opening
on her blog and social media.

364
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,472
All those people came because of that?

365
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,434
What's our total?

366
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,354
We did 3,200,000 won.

367
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,689
What? 3,200,000 won?

368
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,732
On a weekday?

369
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,361
I know, right? It's amazing.
It's the best we've ever done.

370
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,531
It won't last.
This is only effective short-term.

371
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,494
We must make sure
these customers come back.

372
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,706
But how, specifically?

373
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,960
Not sure.

374
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,807
JANGGA PUB

375
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,750
It's good.
The taste lives up to our standards.

376
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,085
Thank you.

377
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,379
It's all thanks to your recipe, sir.

378
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,923
Would you like to see
the monthly sales report?

379
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,550
I already saw it.

380
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,927
The numbers have gone up
since you joined them.

381
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,929
Thank you, sir.

382
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,933
By the way,
what brings you here at this hour?

383
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,770
Can you step out briefly?

384
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,317
I found a decent girl for Geun-won.

385
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,736
I see.

386
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,867
But it sounds like
he has feelings for you.

387
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,249
That fool. I guess you don't feel
the same way about him.

388
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,960
You got the wrong idea, sir.

389
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,712
"Wrong idea"?

390
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,339
Here's what's interesting.

391
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,426
If you were interested in dating him,

392
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,761
I wouldn't be against it.

393
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,346
Sir.

394
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,557
Don't mind me.

395
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,519
This old man won't meddle
in your youngsters' love life.

396
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,732
I'm just letting you know
that I approve of you.

397
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,695
I know that you're torn
between me and Min-jung.

398
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,658
I'm a mere employee, sir.

399
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,576
Right.

400
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,580
I've always thought that was enough,

401
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,041
but I hate losing,

402
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,627
so it really bothers me.

403
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,503
Pardon me?

404
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,841
I told you that I think of you
as part of my family.

405
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,344
You shouldn't be neutral.

406
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,554
You have to be on my side.

407
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,390
Of course, sir.

408
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,271
You've always been like this.
You never say what I don't want to hear.

409
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,609
It is time for action,

410
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,405
not words.

411
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,158
"Actions"? What do you mean, sir?

412
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,704
That pub over there.

413
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,706
DANBAM

414
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,832
DanBam.

415
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,880
So this is Park Saeroyi's pub, right?

416
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,761
It's doing well.

417
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,179
He managed to revive it

418
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,765
after getting suspended
as if nothing had happened.

419
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,977
They just reopened, sir.
You shouldn't be concerned with it.

420
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,396
Do you really think so?

421
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,277
Or do you want to protect him
because he's your friend?

422
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,245
HAMILTON HOTEL

423
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,621
Many people leave

424
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,624
by the time the subway stops,
so most places close by then.

425
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,669
But there are still passersby.

426
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,922
I think we can attract people
who work in the area.

427
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,051
How about we extend our hours
to when the subway service resumes?

428
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,986
Are you headed home?

429
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,865
Yes.

430
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,618
Why is it so hard to see you?

431
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,704
You've been ignoring my calls and texts.

432
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,541
If it's because--

433
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,126
I'm ignoring you on purpose.

434
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,129
Don't call me.

435
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,061
DANBAM

436
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,157
Table eight wants
a milder squid jjamppong.

437
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,074
Got it.

438
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,497
Boss.

439
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,333
Table 12 wants their stir-fried pork
to be really spicy.

440
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,417
Okay.

441
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,676
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

442
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,808
We can finally take a break.

443
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,684
How much did we sell?

444
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,437
We sold 2,500,000 won.

445
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,773
Really? That's less than yesterday.

446
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,108
Today is a weekday. We're doing amazing.

447
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,236
We barely used to make 1,000,000
on weekends.

448
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,075
Saeroyi really is amazing.

449
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,745
Today's Hyun-yi's day off,
so he cooked everything by himself.

450
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,622
Yes, he's a great cook.

451
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,085
Let's eat.

452
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,628
-Okay.
-Okay.

453
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,305
My gosh.

454
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,100
It's the best soft tofu stew
I've ever had.

455
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,727
I just follow the recipe.

456
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,566
How did you end up hiring the cook?

457
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,526
Hyun-yi?

458
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,613
We used to work in the same factory.

459
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,407
What? I didn't know that.

460
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,409
I thought he used to be a cook.

461
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,787
Why did you hire him as a cook
when he's never worked in the kitchen?

462
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,085
Because I really liked the lunch

463
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,462
he once made for me.

464
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,261
Eat up and go home.

465
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,722
We're done cleaning,
so I'll finish up the rest.

466
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:31,973
Really?

467
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,735
The bus isn't running yet,
and we need to wait a bit longer.

468
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,029
Do you want to go clubbing?

469
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,240
-Club?
-That sounds like an idea.

470
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,079
Well...

471
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,333
Is it fun?

472
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,459
What?

473
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,503
What do you mean? Clubbing?

474
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,839
I've never been.

475
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,382
What? Really?

476
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,885
You've never been clubbing at that age?

477
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,971
Why? Don't you like clubbing?

478
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,599
I'm not a very good dancer.

479
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,975
That doesn't matter.

480
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,728
There are tons of people there,
so no one will notice.

481
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,314
This is all you have to do.

482
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,943
Just dance to the rhythm,
and your body will do the rest.

483
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,576
Like this?

484
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,083
Yes, like that.

485
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,877
-I'm sorry.
-She says I'm fine.

486
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,507
When people go clubbing,

487
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,511
do they really twerk and grind

488
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,846
-and end up dating each other?
-What the heck?

489
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,181
Why? Did I sound perverted?

490
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,686
My gosh. What's so perverted
about hitting on someone?

491
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,937
It's natural.

492
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,730
People go clubbing to dance,

493
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,650
listen to music,
and to have fun with the opposite sex.

494
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
Then

495
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,239
I want to grind.

496
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,074
My gosh, will you stop?

497
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,160
What a pervert.

498
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,455
-You little punk.
-Okay.

499
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,207
-What?
-Come over here.

500
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,834
What? Why?

501
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,211
Let me teach you how it normally works.

502
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,589
Let's say this is the person you like.

503
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,050
The club will most definitely be packed.

504
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,429
You need to walk through the crowd
and stand right behind her.

505
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,347
Then let her know that you're there.

506
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,974
-Like this.
-My gosh.

507
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,519
Stretch your arms out so she can see
and start dancing to the rhythm.

508
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:46,607
Then she'll slowly realize
that a guy is starting to hit on her.

509
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,609
What if she doesn't like it?

510
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,863
It's not like you're going to touch her
or anything.

511
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,032
She came all dolled up.

512
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,325
Whether she likes you or not,

513
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,078
her ego will boost
just because a guy hit on her.

514
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,622
She might turn you down,

515
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,249
but she won't hate it.

516
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,001
Unless the guy is really ugly.

517
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,421
But I personally think

518
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,465
you'll be fine.

519
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,841
You're not too bad.

520
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,304
And don't let it get to you
even if you get rejected.

521
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,890
She won't be the last woman
you'll ever meet.

522
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,725
-Right.
-Think of it comfortably.

523
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,893
Okay.

524
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,479
Let's try it again. Come here.

525
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,397
As you dance behind her,

526
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,192
slowly move your body closer to hers.

527
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,151
Hey.

528
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,446
But don't make it too obvious.

529
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,573
-Okay.
-Move to the rhythm,

530
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,951
and make it seem like your body
accidentally brushed against hers.

531
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,039
Then she'll turn around and check you out.

532
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,917
That's when you should put on a big smile

533
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,503
to show her that you're having a blast.

534
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,171
Like a happy kid.

535
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,092
This is important.

536
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,054
But if she turns around and glares at you,

537
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,181
then you should know

538
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,766
that you have no hope.

539
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,850
You should give up.

540
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,852
But if she smiles back at you,

541
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,563
that means she likes you too.

542
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,357
Then you can start getting closer.

543
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,402
Hold her shoulder and dance to the beat.

544
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,490
Start dancing to the music together.

545
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,951
Then slowly place your hand on her waist.

546
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,077
My gosh, hey.

547
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,165
After you dance with her a bit more
and give her a few compliments...

548
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,836
-Yes?
-Aren't you thirsty?

549
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,338
I have a table over there.

550
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,881
Do you want to drink with me?

551
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,510
That's all you need to say to her.

552
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,806
-Then the night will be yours.
-That's nuts.

553
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,307
I'm so excited.

554
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:44,976
What?

555
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,191
What's wrong with you?

556
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,443
Why would we grab a table?

557
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,654
It's okay. He'll pay for it.

558
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,741
Should we get going?

559
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,535
Okay, let's hurry up. Come on.

560
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,704
Let's go!

561
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,179
Why is this bottle so expensive here?

562
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,015
It's not that bad
because today's a weekday.

563
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,142
It's more expensive
on the weekends.

564
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,270
My gosh, she's just trying to rip you off.

565
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,063
I'll pitch in.

566
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,399
No, it's okay.
I'm the oldest, so I should pay.

567
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,110
I'm impressed.

568
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,738
What do you think?
It's your first time here.

569
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,573
It's loud and distracting.

570
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,243
But I like what I'm seeing.

571
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,247
Then have a shot.

572
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,543
-Let's have some fun.
-Okay. Cheers.

573
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,669
Cheers.

574
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,065
It's not good to hit on multiple women.

575
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,653
"Is he hitting on me
after he got rejected by her?"

576
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,905
You don't want a woman to think that.

577
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,033
Your first choice is important.

578
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,588
My first choice

579
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,632
is you.

580
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,310
He's going to make a move.

581
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,939
She's too good for him.

582
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,281
Stick out my arms so she'll notice.

583
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,455
Don't be too obvious.
My body should lightly brush against hers.

584
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,961
Then she'll turn around and check you out.

585
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,548
That's when you should put on a big smile

586
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,217
to show her that you're having a blast.

587
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,344
Like a happy kid.

588
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,014
That's the important part.

589
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,864
What are you doing?

590
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,203
Seung-kwon, what are you doing?

591
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,830
Do you know me?

592
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,207
How do you know me?

593
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,586
I want to know more about you.

594
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,726
What?

595
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,603
Why?

596
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,271
Is that...

597
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,113
Hyun-yi?

598
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,090
A transgender?

599
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,258
Why did you keep it a secret?

600
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,429
I never kept it a secret.

601
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,806
Does our boss know?

602
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,768
-Yes.
-So does that mean

603
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,437
you got your surgery done?

604
00:39:58,979 --> 00:39:59,814
What surgery?

605
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,108
No, not yet. I'm saving up to get one.

606
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,862
Does that mean you still have a--

607
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,572
Why don't you just shut up?

608
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,700
Aren't there a lot of transgender clubs
in Itaewon?

609
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,369
Why are you here?

610
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,289
Because I wanted to come here.

611
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,626
You don't look like it,
but you're very narrow-minded.

612
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,340
I can't believe you guys grabbed a table
on my day off.

613
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,842
Something good happened today?

614
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,052
Well...

615
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,150
I guess I'm making you feel uncomfortable.

616
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,237
I won't bother you.

617
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,989
-Hey, wait.
-Hey, bro--

618
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,323
Have fun, you guys.

619
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,368
Hey, sis... My gosh.

620
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,078
What? Darn it.

621
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,038
My gosh.

622
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,169
Unbelievable. Hey, you remember

623
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,754
that pub called DanBam or whatever?

624
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,673
Yes, I remember. What about it?

625
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,426
I think Yi-seo, that bitch, works there.

626
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,343
I don't think so.

627
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,929
No way. She makes enough money
through social media.

628
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,473
Take a look.

629
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,807
She's right.

630
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,518
She doesn't look part-time,
but with some kind of a role.

631
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,856
Look at that fucking smile.
She must be having fun.

632
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,528
I couldn't even graduate because of her.

633
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,616
She must be having fun
after having ruined my life.

634
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,076
This girl must be out of her mind.

635
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,954
DANBAM

636
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,749
-Excuse me.
-Yes? Just a second.

637
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,377
We found a hair in our food.

638
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,217
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new dish.

639
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,468
I'm sorry.

640
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,304
Did you ring the bell?

641
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,806
Yes, the stew tastes too bland.

642
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,059
-Oh, really?
-Can we get some salt?

643
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,770
Okay, sure. I'm sorry.
I'll get it for you right now.

644
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,812
Sorry.

645
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,324
What do you think you're doing?
And what is this?

646
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,911
I'm sick of saying the same thing
over and over again.

647
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,622
And don't you taste the food
before you serve it?

648
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,291
Do you just do the bare minimum

649
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,960
and wait until you get paid?

650
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,920
You must think life is so easy.

651
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,256
If you're not good enough,

652
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,092
you should at least think
about the pub and quit.

653
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,386
Why do you even work here

654
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,013
when you can't even cook properly?

655
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,642
What is it?

656
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,977
What's going on?

657
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,926
A transgender?

658
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,345
What about that?

659
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:21,932
What?

660
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,729
You really knew?

661
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,355
I found out at the factory.

662
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,525
What? Then I was the only one
who didn't know?

663
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,569
Let me ask you something.

664
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,195
Why did you hire him?

665
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,241
What kind of question is that?
To cook, of course.

666
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,745
Yes, but Hyun-yi's not good at cooking.

667
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,372
It's the only problem we have.

668
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,168
PR, good service, and a nice ambiance
isn't enough to secure customers.

669
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,171
The most important thing
is to have good food.

670
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,715
But the food doesn't taste that nice.

671
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,426
We won't be able to last long.

672
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,388
What's your point?

673
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,142
Fire Hyun-yi.

674
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,020
-Hey, what are you--
-I know you care

675
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,064
and that you're a good person.

676
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,524
And I like that about you.

677
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:17,446
But what kind of a cook
can't cook better than the owner?

678
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,783
And what if people find out
that he's a transgender?

679
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,202
It'll make some people
feel uncomfortable.

680
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,954
We're not here to play around.

681
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,291
DanBam can do much better.

682
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,212
I know you feel sorry to do this.

683
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,507
You have to make a decision.

684
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:46,725
Geun-soo.

685
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:48,936
Yes?

686
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
Bring Hyun-yi.

687
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,360
But...

688
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,653
Hey, boss--

689
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,570
Bring Hyun-yi.

690
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,758
How do you feel

691
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,261
working here?

692
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:23,887
Do you enjoy it?

693
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,602
Yes.

694
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,484
I know everyone is doing their best.

695
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,902
But it's not enough.

696
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,160
I want DanBam to become a huge business.

697
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,789
But the biggest problem we have right now

698
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,709
is your food.

699
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,798
It's not that good.

700
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,316
You know you're not doing well enough,
right?

701
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,948
I understand.

702
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,715
Take this.

703
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,634
Hey, boss.

704
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,268
It's your pay for this month.

705
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,114
Thank you for everything until now.

706
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,407
It's twice your pay.

707
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,503
If you like working here,

708
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,340
I want you to work twice as hard.

709
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,890
Can you do that?

710
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:46,989
Yes.

711
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,166
Did you hear that?

712
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,419
Sir--

713
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,879
And let me tell you something.

714
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,505
Listen carefully.

715
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,557
The world avoids people like me
because I'm an ex-convict.

716
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,102
And the three of you,
Yi-seo, Geun-soo, and Seung-kwon...

717
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,856
You guys recently made a scene
and got me suspended.

718
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,482
Hyun-yi?

719
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,444
All Hyun-yi has done is work hard

720
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,405
without causing us any trouble.

721
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,574
Just like you guys,

722
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,163
Hyun-yi's one of my people.

723
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,129
I care about it.

724
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,798
You might feel uncomfortable.

725
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,550
I'd appreciate it if you understand.

726
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,136
I can't force you to understand,

727
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:56,183
but if you have a problem working
with Hyun-yi for being a transgender,

728
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,857
you have to tell me now.

729
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,488
No matter who it is,

730
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,747
I'll make my decision.

731
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,014
What else can I say?

732
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,646
Let's do this right.

733
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,319
I'll work hard.

734
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,574
I'll go check the order list.

735
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,183
How eventful it's been.

736
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,435
Long time no see.

737
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,232
Are you ignoring us?

738
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,652
You should say hello
when you meet a friend from school.

739
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,574
Why am I your friend
when you didn't even graduate?

740
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,576
You crazy bitch.

741
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,577
Hey.

742
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,082
-What's going on?
-Stay out of this, Jang Geun-soo.

743
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,294
You stay out of this. You're 20 now.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

744
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,213
I've been nothing but nice to you
because you're cute.

745
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,673
Did you forget it?

746
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,593
What good is it going to do for me?

747
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,512
What do you think?

748
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,141
Where are you going, you dullhead?

749
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,312
Let go.
Isn't getting expelled enough for you?

750
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,773
Gosh, you sound so scary.

751
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,359
Isn't this reverse discrimination or what?

752
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,862
I got expelled
because my dad is a politician.

753
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,073
But you got away with under-age drinking.

754
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,243
Gosh, how did you know that?

755
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,828
Do you shadow me?

756
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,538
Are you a stalker?

757
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,748
What do you think?

758
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,666
I know it because I called the police.

759
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,127
What?

760
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,173
What do you mean?

761
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,341
Why?

762
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,760
Do you think you'll be okay
after screwing me over?

763
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,514
Hey.

764
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,724
Are you insane?

765
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,392
This isn't about us.

766
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,603
Do you know
how much damage it did to the pub?

767
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,523
I don't care. It's you guys
who went there, you nut heads.

768
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,440
So

769
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,278
was it you who reported me to the police?

770
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,157
Yes. I just did what you did to me.
So what?

771
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,617
She deserves more than that.

772
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,703
It's nothing compared
to what Bok-hui had to go through.

773
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,831
So what's the deal?

774
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,457
Do you work there?

775
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,918
Does your boss have no self-respect?

776
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,211
Why did he hire you?

777
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,089
Is he a pushover or something?

778
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,718
Shut it.

779
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,720
What?

780
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,807
Are you here to have a chat with me?

781
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,434
I guess you're glad to see me.

782
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,645
You're supposed to kick my ass.

783
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,897
Isn't that why you were waiting for me?

784
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,316
-That's right, you bitch.
-Stop it.

785
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,405
Bok-hui.

786
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,867
Oh, right.

787
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,493
Did you not know?

788
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,788
I slapped your mom
in the face just like this.

789
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,498
How dare you...

790
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,293
Gosh, I'm sorry.

791
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,593
Bok-hui.

792
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,680
Did you think you could beat me?

793
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,723
You crazy bitch.

794
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,188
You should think about the consequences
before you do something.

795
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,856
You dumbhead.

796
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:18,236
There's no way you can beat me.

797
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,948
Because of you, my boss got suspended.

798
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:26,203
Do you even know how much the damage is?

799
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:27,704
Jo Yi-seo!

800
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,331
Enough.

801
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:36,963
The person
who reported your pub to the police.

802
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,759
It's me.

803
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,722
How annoying.

804
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,724
Let go.

805
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,684
You imbecile.

806
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,373
Seoul Police Station.

807
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,087
Hello?

808
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:18,964
It's nothing.

809
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,424
I called the wrong number.

810
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,134
I'm sorry.

811
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:32,894
Damn it.

812
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,562
Excuse me.

813
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,567
Isn't that Jo Yi-seo?

814
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,945
It's her.

815
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,156
Gosh, is she drinking?

816
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,825
I got you.

817
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,871
Hello? Is this the police station?

818
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,582
I'm in Itaewon now.

819
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,886
Was it you who reported me to the police?

820
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,513
Do you work there?

821
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,974
Does your boss have no self-respect?

822
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,183
Why did he hire you?

823
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,478
Is he a pushover or something?

824
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:27,866
DANBAM

825
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,455
You seem serious.

826
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,623
Is it about Hyun-yi?

827
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,210
You would suffer a loss
to keep your friendship?

828
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,880
You call those people pushovers.

829
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,217
I know what you think,

830
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,386
and I won't talk more about it.

831
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,638
But I haven't changed my mind yet.

832
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,391
Good.

833
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,812
You're not a pushover.

834
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,568
Don't change your mind.

835
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,696
You should guide Hyun-yi
so we won't suffer a loss.

836
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,000
How can I do that?
I know nothing about cooking.

837
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,462
You can tell
if something tastes good or not.

838
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,595
It's spicy but too bland.

839
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,098
The ingredients don't mix in
with the soup.

840
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,767
I'll try it again.

841
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,730
You just need to keep giving her
honest feedback.

842
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,856
Until you're satisfied.

843
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,733
I think it's well seasoned,

844
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,527
but the MSG tastes too strong.

845
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,196
It gives an unpleasant aftertaste.

846
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,740
Oh, okay.

847
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,283
Let me try it one more time.

848
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,455
Hyun-yi will trust your feedback
and try to improve it.

849
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,125
And someday...

850
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,472
Hey, what do you think?

851
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:19,269
Isn't it obvious?
Yi-seo is exceptionally picky.

852
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,148
That nasty punk in a leather jacket.

853
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,526
What do you think?

854
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,788
I couldn't understand Saeroyi.

855
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,083
"Why wouldn't he just fire this person?"

856
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,548
Is it bad again?

857
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:54,429
I'm just doing this
because that's my boss's order.

858
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,104
I'll try harder.
If you give me some time--

859
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,230
It tastes good.

860
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,198
It's really good.

861
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,548
Your hair is all rough and dry.

862
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,008
What?

863
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,803
You look prettier with black hair.

864
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,347
Sis.

865
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,401
Hyun-yi.

866
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,499
You did it.

867
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,710
You saw this coming, right?

868
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,337
What?

869
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:11,798
You gave her twice her salary.

870
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,384
If she didn't improve,

871
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,219
you would've lost the money.

872
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,514
I trusted Hyun-yi.

873
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,684
All right.

874
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,937
It ended successfully anyway.

875
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,981
I'll just stay quiet.

876
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,608
It's not just about Hyun-yi.

877
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,527
I trusted you too.

878
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,533
Well done.

879
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,481
Apparently Park Saeroyi

880
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,568
opened a store in Itaewon.

881
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,861
Did you know?

882
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,575
Do you really think so?

883
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,078
Or do you want to protect him
because he's your friend?

884
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,275
How annoying.

885
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,152
You made a choice.

886
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,820
So just stick to it.

887
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,448
You did nothing wrong.

888
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,785
How annoying.

889
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:05,620
Park Saeroyi and me.

890
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,456
Whom would you choose?

891
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,380
It's annoying.

892
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,173
It's so annoying!

893
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,811
Who is it?

894
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,855
Who's so annoying?

895
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:46,953
You.

896
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,624
And you're annoyed by me.

897
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,418
Right?

898
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,211
Just tell me.

899
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,592
What's wrong? Did something happen?

900
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,429
Just be honest.

901
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,180
I'm disgusting.

902
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:10,810
You're upset with what I did, right?

903
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,820
Will you guys go on ahead?

904
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:23,906
-Okay. We will.
-We will save you a seat.

905
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,409
-Let's go, Yi-seo.
-Go on ahead.

906
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,716
I've been avoiding you.

907
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:42,967
I'm glad we met.

908
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,052
I wanted to ask you something.

909
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,348
What's the reason
your business is going well?

910
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,272
Can't you tell me?

911
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,065
We're friends.

912
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,992
Because I have a good manager.

913
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,496
I see.

914
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,247
That cute one?

915
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,169
You're drunk. Let's go.

916
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,420
Let go of me.

917
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,382
You know what?

918
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,845
I'm not sorry for you at all.

919
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,181
Do you know why?

920
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,435
Because I'm the most precious thing to me.

921
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,480
And I...

922
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,817
only care about myself.

923
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,237
Do you think it's wrong?

924
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:47,949
It's just natural.

925
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,492
Bullshit.

926
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,789
Hey, you know what?

927
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,960
I hate it when you pretend
to know everything like that.

928
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,549
You're an ex-convict
who barely finished middle school.

929
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,635
But you make me feel like shit.

930
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,017
Why are you having a hard time?

931
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,650
Don't be like that.

932
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,946
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

933
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,327
You just tried your best for your life.

934
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,913
You didn't do anything wrong.

935
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:42,587
Please...

936
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,842
Please don't say that to me.

937
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:52,847
It's cold. Let's go.

938
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,858
The thing is...

939
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,194
Saeroyi.

940
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,616
Go ahead.

941
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,081
To me...

942
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,500
you are...

943
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,470
always...

944
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,682
shining...

945
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,981
too bright.

946
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,563
Criminal Law Article 32.

947
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:27,775
Yi-seo.

948
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,070
A kiss without consent of the opposition

949
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:32,947
is an indecent assault.

950
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,187
I like my boss.

951
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,398
I'll just have to destroy you.

952
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,817
My goal is to franchise DanBam.

953
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,902
There's no way
he will pose a threat to us.

954
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,572
Soo-ah is in trouble at work
because of you.

955
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,407
But she wouldn't want a murderer.

956
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,451
You seriously shouldn't like me anymore.

957
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,078
These days, I feel like I'm playing go
with a handicap.

958
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,997
I'm not giving up.

959
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,373
You need to see this.

960
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:25,958
How much is this?

961
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,295
So that you won't suffer anymore,
I'll destroy Jangga Co.
