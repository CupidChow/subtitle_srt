00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,000
You...

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,230
have no right to make my house dirty!

4
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,730
I surrender!

5
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,780
Don't hurt me!

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,560
I'll clean it!

7
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,850
- I surrender!
- Pan!

8
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,640
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't hurt me!

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Wake up!

10
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,140
What's up, bro.

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,550
You have nightmares as soon as you change your sleeping location.

12
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,270
Yes. Damn.

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,440
It's terrifying.

14
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,510
Do you know? I've never had a nightmare like this before.

15
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,550
It serves you right.

16
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,440
This is not a normal bedtime.

17
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,870
I think I'll just sleep for a bit.

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,950
But it turned out that I fell asleep for a long time.

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,370
Ouch! I have a headache.

20
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,520
When will you sleep again when you're awake now?

21
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,340
Well, I'll handle it myself.

22
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,290
Uh.

23
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,330
Just now, you said you had a nightmare.

24
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,770
What did you dream about?

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,530
Please tell me. I want to know.

26
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,450
Please.

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,440
Does it have a number?

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,580
Just in case I tell my mom to buy lottery tickets.

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,130
Please.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,940
Tell me.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,030
Please.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
It's already 8:30 p.m.!?

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,030
Wow, I slept for a really long time.

34
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,390
I'm going to have a shower.

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,190
You didn't tell me at all.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,390
You're a miser.

37
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,110
I won't tell you.

38
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,440
I'm going to take a shower.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,410
You too. Don't stink next to me.

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,290
- Or I'll kick you out of bed.
- That's you.

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,820
Just take a shower.

42
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,110
You didn't even tell me. So boring.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,330
You keep complaining to me.

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,800
♫ I still miss you no matter what ♫

45
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,410
♫ The more good the memory is, the more painful it is ♫

46
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,669
♫ I never forget you ♫

47
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,209
♫ The old love is still deeply etched in my heart ♫

48
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,980
♫ Every word is still the same as in the past ♫

49
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,640
♫ I know it hurts, but why doesn't it end? ♫

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,999
♫ It's painful every time ♫

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,590
♫ I just need time to forget it ♫

52
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,360
♫ But don't be longer than this ♫

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,850
♫ Just being able to let go for a minute, ♫

54
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,399
♫ I'm pleased ♫

55
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,320
That's a guitar sound!

56
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,360
P!

57
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,580
P!

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,920
What, Beboy?

59
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,440
Who watches TV at a time like this?

60
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,610
Come on!

61
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,520
Follow me!

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,260
- What's wrong with you? Where will you take me?
- Come here!

63
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,920
Hurry up!

64
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,920
Come here.

65
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,120
Ouch, Beboy.

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,319
Alright, just follow me.

67
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,490
Where are you dragging me?

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,850
Wow.

69
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,090
What?

70
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,570
Go.

71
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,690
I'm really fed up with you, Beboy.

72
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,430
Huh?

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,140
You dragged me like an object. I'm not...

74
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,820
You don't have a room?
So you're standing in front of someone else's room.

75
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:11,790
Oh.

76
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,990
Why are you here?

77
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,610
I hear a guitar.

78
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,770
Since you can play the guitar beautifully, please play it downstairs.

79
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,370
Please. I want to listen to it.

80
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,450
Hey.

81
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,560
Beboy.

82
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,790
Why did you drag me here?

83
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,200
It's really a waste of my beer drinking time.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm going outside.

85
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,890
Hey!

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,370
How can you say this?

87
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,990
It makes me upset.

88
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,690
Why?

89
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,820
What are you upset about?

90
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,460
Huh?

91
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,940
Look, there are many of my friends here.

92
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,080
How can you find happiness outside alone?

93
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,830
You really are badass.

94
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't want to curse you and waste my time.

95
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,080
Hold on. You already cursed me, didn't you?

96
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,350
Look at you.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,030
Hey!

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,770
Stop arguing.

99
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,630
Why do you have to argue?

100
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,670
Even though you guys are in the same house.

101
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,190
I figured it out!

102
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,660
P!

103
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,880
What?

104
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,950
You!

105
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,640
Me?

106
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,640
Yes. You.

107
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,430
You just buy beer and bring it home.

108
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,470
We have singers here. It's awesome.

109
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,710
We can hang out another day.

110
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,620
Right? Do you think like this?

111
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,350
You prevented my happiness again.

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,920
Please, P.

113
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,310
I beg you.

114
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,320
Please?

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,850
Here.

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,890
1,000.

117
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,350
I will treat you.

118
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,520
I'm generous.

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,670
Just end it.

120
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,640
1,000?

121
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,980
1,000 yen?

122
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,180
You are so generous.

123
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,070
Huh?

124
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,140
Beer in Japan isn't 40 baht per can like in Thailand.

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,050
I really have a headache.

126
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm not a drinker like you.

127
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,750
Is it better to search for information on your phone?

128
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,460
- Huh?
- Hey, stop it.

129
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:00,940
Here.

130
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,340
Stop.

131
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,360
Here.

132
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,800
Just say I'm helping share the money.

133
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
I think it can make it quite intoxicating.

134
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,010
That's it!

135
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,170
10,000 yen.

136
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,910
Not 1,000 yen like you.

137
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,890
What can it be purchased?

138
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,480
You don't know anything.

139
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,040
Bye.

140
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,010
Hey.

141
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,050
There's no more beer.

142
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm going to buy more beer.

143
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,830
You guys wait here.

144
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,770
I'm going to buy it myself.

145
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,150
Hey, P.

146
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,030
What?

147
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,790
Buy me a snack.

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,480
I'm not a drinker.

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,050
I'm better at snacking.

150
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,890
You only gave me 1,000 yen.

151
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,540
But you're really picky.

152
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,200
I think there's a lot of stuff.

153
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,380
Pan.

154
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,970
Please help P.

155
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,030
I'll take care of the rest of the house with Beboy.

156
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,330
Hey, it's okay.

157
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,570
This neighborhood is my home.

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
I'm chill.

159
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,820
It doesn't matter whose neighborhood it is.

160
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
You're the only one carrying heavy things.

161
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
It's better if I help you.

162
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,070
And we...

163
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,680
Let's clean up the dishes and spoons.

164
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,360
It's quiet around here.

165
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,330
Why do people in this area sleep so early?

166
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,630
Even though it's only 9 p.m. right now.

167
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,870
Look.

168
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,100
Each house closed its doors and windows quietly.

169
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,500
If it were Bangkok,

170
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,450
even if it was late at night it would be crowded with people.

171
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,760
I don't know why they are so lively late at night.

172
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,150
Uh.

173
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,310
But there really are a lot of shops around here.

174
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,840
Look.

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,060
It also has many vending machines.

176
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,050
I can find it no matter where I walk.

177
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,420
Aren't they afraid of many competitors?

178
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,800
If it were me, I'd have a hard time choosing a shop.

179
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,160
Umm.

180
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,590
Uh.

181
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,690
But there really are a lot of shops around here.

182
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,810
But it all closed at 9 p.m.

183
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,350
Umm.

184
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,530
P.

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,290
What?

186
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,280
It's really art.

187
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,970
Hurry and check this one.

188
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,350
Is it beautiful?

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,370
Well.

190
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,170
Hey, P.

191
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,600
Umm.

192
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,370
I also want to take pictures.

193
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Please take a photo for me.

194
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,700
Like this.

195
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,960
Can you?

196
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,850
Yeah, stand here.

197
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,480
Well.

198
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,120
Go.

199
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,080
Hey.

200
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:27,870
Are you ready now?

201
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,430
I have waited for you for a long time.

202
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,200
Huh?

203
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,040
Why didn't you tell me? How do I know?

204
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,570
Well, turn around again.

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,430
I will call your name.

206
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,100
Are you ready?

207
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,220
Pan.

209
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,880
Here.

210
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,410
Go.

211
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,960
Thank you.

212
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,070
Uh, Plai.

213
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,760
Huh?

214
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,480
Where should we sit?

215
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,640
Sofa?

216
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:18,400
Or the same place.

217
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,520
Same place.

218
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm too lazy to move things.

219
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,530
Yeah, I think so.

220
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,460
Are four glasses enough?

221
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,760
It should be four glasses.

222
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,760
There are only four of us.

223
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,150
Don't tell me you've seen more than four people.

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,320
Hey, crazy.

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,340
I'm just asking you just in case.

226
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,490
I'm so relieved.

227
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,090
Hey, one more thing.

228
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,640
You can use informal language.

229
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,080
So that we can become close quickly.

230
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,210
Yeah.

231
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,390
Do I have to take out plates and bowls?

232
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,390
I think it's good.

233
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,970
Just take 2-3 small plates.

234
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,970
Oh, don't forget the trash can.

235
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,050
Okay.

236
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,430
The weather in Japan is great.

237
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,230
But it's quieter than you think, right?

238
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,600
If you like chaos and light, color, sound, you should go there.

239
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,400
Around Shibuya, Shinjuku, Odaiba, something like that.

240
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,900
I guarantee you'll bump with the crowd until you're dizzy.

241
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,060
Really?

242
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:20,940
Hey!

243
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,880
Does that mean you've been there before?

244
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,400
First time for Japan.

245
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,400
If you say it's your first time for Japan,

246
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,720
does that mean you've visited other countries before?

247
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,640
Right?

248
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,920
Yeah.

249
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,920
Pan and I often travel to find inspiration for songwriting.

250
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:46,720
Actually, I've been to Austria, America, China, Korea.

251
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,080
Korea too?

252
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,570
Yeah.

253
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Wow.

254
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,800
Don't tell me, this is your first time traveling abroad?

255
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,620
Yes!

256
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,330
Here.

257
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,840
This is my first time.

258
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,420
I'm really excited.

259
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,270
And this was my first airplane flight.

260
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,430
My mom was very happy to know that I would be traveling to Japan.

261
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,890
She boasted about it to people around the village.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,950
Wow.

263
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,620
There are about 7-8 houses that know about it.

264
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,960
Everyone in my village knows about it.

265
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,609
How is traveling in Japan?

266
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,530
Do you like it?

267
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,990
Yeah.

268
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,840
The place and everything is new.

269
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,670
Moreover, I can't communicate with anyone.

270
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,430
Umm.

271
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:32,220
My English is very poor.

272
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,070
I can only use my hands and gestures to communicate on a daily basis.

273
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,100
Just for survive each day.

274
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,000
Like this.

275
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,880
Like this.

276
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,650
Like this.

277
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Just like that.

278
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,920
It's great for your first time.

279
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,250
I often got lost the first time.

280
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,290
I got on the wrong subway and got confused.

281
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,660
It's good that I bought a train ticket for 7 days.

282
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,780
Otherwise, I'll definitely run out of money for my trip.

283
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,770
Hey, I'll tell you something.

284
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm lost too.

285
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,440
Really?

286
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,970
Yes.

287
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,550
I was lost at Narita Airport for several hours.

288
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,670
It's nice that the staff there helped me.

289
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,240
Otherwise, I would cry at the airport because I didn't get to go home.

290
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,810
It's awesome that you were able to do this.

291
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,170
I admit that I am a fearful and cowardly person.

292
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,700
P asked me to travel here many times.

293
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,830
I always rejected him.

294
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,920
He said last time that if I didn't come here, he wouldn't ask me again.

295
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,550
That's it. I have no experience with it.

296
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,560
In the end, I realized that I couldn't grow if I stayed in the same place.

297
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,480
So, I came to meet P.

298
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,330
Just think of it as a new experience.

299
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,720
And how is it?

300
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,520
It's good.

301
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,560
It's not bad.

302
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,840
If I knew it, I would have visited here a long time ago.

303
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,180
I shouldn't waste my time.

304
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,160
What time is it now?

305
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,660
Oh!

306
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,520
Is it already past 10 p.m.?

307
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,670
I think it will be a while before they come back.

308
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,670
Umm.

309
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,110
You took a shower, right?

310
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,840
Yes.

311
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,540
Then I should take a shower.

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
Because after I arrived here, my face and body still haven't been touched by a drop of water.

313
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,140
Ew!!

314
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,950
Filthy.

315
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,770
You suddenly disgust me.

316
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,900
Hurry and take a shower!

317
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,770
Yeah.

318
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,840
Please wait for me a moment.

319
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,540
I will come back.

320
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,250
Umm.

321
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,399
♫ You're good enough ♫

322
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,880
♫ You're a perfect match ♫

323
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,420
♫ that I need ♫

324
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,080
♫ And no matter how long, it's always you ♫

325
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,590
♫ And there's no one else ♫

326
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,200
♫ Change my heart ♫

327
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,960
♫ I love you because you are you ♫

328
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,960
Yay!

329
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,670
Hey, it's hot!

330
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,050
Hey, it's hot!

331
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,280
It's really hot!

332
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,150
Plai!

333
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,319
Hey, somebody please help me!

334
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,140
Damn, what happened to him?

335
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,810
Hey, it's hot!

336
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,470
- Beboy!
- Plai!

337
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,470
Hey, it's hot!

338
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,820
Hey, it's hot!

339
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,190
Hey, somebody please help me!

340
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,850
Plai!

341
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,440
Plai!

342
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,030
Damn, it's hot!

343
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,250
I'm here!

344
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,260
Help me!

345
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,470
Damn.

346
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,080
Damn hot!

347
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,640
Hey!

348
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,360
Hey!?

349
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,430
Before turning on the shower, turn this one to the center.

350
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
I've turned it towards the colder side.

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,590
Next time, turn it to the center before turning on the shower.

352
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,720
Hey!

353
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,100
Damn!

354
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,150
What's wrong with you?

355
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,340
This!

356
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:38,960
Why?

357
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,160
What's wrong with you?

358
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,160
Thank you!

359
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,320
What's wrong with you, Beboy?

360
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,040
Why didn't you turn on the shower after I left?

361
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,190
Hey!

363
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,190
Hmm.

364
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:01,910
Hey!

365
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm lazy to change my clothes.

366
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,800
H... hey!

368
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,510
Hey!

369
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,430
What's wrong with you again?

370
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,480
What are you doing?

371
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,630
Take off my clothes.

372
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,340
Hey!

373
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,770
Can't you see my clothes are wet?

374
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,940
Hey!

375
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,370
P will curse me if water drips on the floor.

376
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,400
We've arrived.

377
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,410
So how is it? It's good that I came with you.

378
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,770
Otherwise, how do you carry it back?

379
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,760
Look.

380
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,760
It has a lot of stuff.

381
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,140
I can carry it anyway.

382
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,580
Hey.

383
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,670
The evidence is clearly visible.

384
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,200
You say it confidently.

385
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,740
Look.

386
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,070
I didn't ask for thanks from you.

387
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,280
I don't want it.

388
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,930
And?

389
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,600
Just talk to me sometimes.

390
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,280
Does it kill you?

391
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,650
Why is it so quiet in this house?

392
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,880
Where are they?

393
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,970
I think they are in the house.

394
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,379
I'll find them upstairs.

395
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,810
He might be in their room.

396
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,820
Then I'll find Beboy.

397
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,330
Well, I'll find Plai.

398
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,270
Hey, Plai!

399
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,660
Beboy, why are you following me?

400
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,510
Your towel.

401
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,400
Hey!

402
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,010
What's wrong with you?

403
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,630
Don't tell me you've never seen another man's p♪nis.

404
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,510
No way.

405
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:23,940
I've only seen mine.

406
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,810
It's all the same.

407
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,660
Why are you overthinking about it?

408
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Damn!

409
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,340
You two!

410
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,600
What happened!?

411
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,700
What the f♪ck are you doing!?

412
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,230
It's not what you think!

413
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,190
Hey!

414
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,600
Wait.

415
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,260
What?

416
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,420
What I saw just now, what happened?

417
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,400
Tell me.

418
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,400
Or...

419
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,720
You guys...

420
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,020
Crazy!

421
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,240
Are you crazy?

422
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,360
I forgot to adjust the shower temperature.

423
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,300
So Plai helped me.

424
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,310
That's all.

425
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,050
Alright.

426
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,670
Just get dressed.

427
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,710
Why are you guys naked?

428
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,900
Just to help him adjust the temperature?

429
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
You're not wet.

430
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,600
Beboy's hand turned on the water by mistake.

431
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,780
It's game over.

432
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,790
Water splashed all over me.

433
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,790
How could it not make me wet?

434
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,670
What's wrong?

435
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Don't. DON'T.

436
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,680
I didn't do anything as you imagine.

437
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,680
Are you sure?

438
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,610
Yeah.

439
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,080
What the hell are you thinking?

440
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,359
Just go downstairs and put things.

441
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,080
Look at you.

442
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:53,080
I'll change clothes.

443
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,290
Uh.

444
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,780
Pan Plai.

445
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,850
Why did you guys come to Japan?

446
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,570
Guess it.

447
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,400
I know!

448
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,350
I know.

449
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,010
You're good at being NOSY about other people's business.

450
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,680
Tell me.

451
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,290
They are singers.

452
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,110
Artists.

453
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,630
Really?

454
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,870
Just wow.

455
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,360
My home has the opportunity to welcome artists.

456
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,629
Well, let's cheers.

457
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,610
It's an honor to have two famous artists from Thailand visit my home.

458
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,450
Not that much.

459
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,610
If we talk about it... we're just trained singers.

460
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,860
Just keep practicing it.

461
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,970
You guys will be professionals one day.

462
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,840
Trust me.

463
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,770
Amen.

464
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,770
Let's cheers.

465
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,420
Cheers.

466
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,930
You will be famous soon.

467
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,500
Cheers.

468
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,530
Uh.

469
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,480
By the way... do you guys compose your own songs?

470
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,770
If possible, I'll write a song, melody, lyrics, something like that.

471
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,410
From my point of view,

472
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,890
I can be proud when singing songs I produced myself.

473
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,530
What kind of music do you guys compose?

474
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,840
Just in case it fits me.

475
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,840
Please write a song for me. Please!

476
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,510
Hey.

477
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,540
That's too much.

478
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,370
Hey.

479
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,610
If he wants you to compose a song, please charge him a high price.

480
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,940
Don't do it for free.

481
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,080
Please charge me a low price.

482
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,820
Now the song I wrote with Pan

483
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,110
is a heartbreak song.

484
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,750
I have to go to the bathroom.

485
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,210
Yeah.

486
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,400
Look at here.

487
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,580
You eat even the short noodles.

488
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,750
I'm just hungry.

489
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,600
Is the one I recommend delicious?

490
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,220
I ate it all. It's delicious.

491
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,230
Looking at the style of the composer...

492
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,350
I think it's definitely you who's heartbroken, Pan.

493
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,400
So why did you come to Japan?

494
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,730
Me?

495
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,080
Actually, I came to travel.

496
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,890
I'm a person who gets bored easily.

497
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,500
I don't like staying in the same place.

498
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,180
Freely go where I want, do what I want to do.

499
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,490
But the reason I was able to stay in Japan for so long
was because it was quiet and not chaotic.

500
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,090
The people here are lovely.

501
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,490
Moreover, the seasons here change continuously.

502
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,070
Maybe it's like I travel every day to a new place.

503
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,980
So what is your dream, P?

504
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,390
My dream?

505
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,450
Actually, I don't have a dream.

506
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,940
Just living each day happily, I am satisfied.

507
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:03,950
Hey.

508
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,160
My beer glass is empty.

509
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,520
Pan.

510
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,220
Please pass me a beer.

511
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,680
Almost.

512
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,530
What?

513
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,800
Huh?

514
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,020
We almost missed something.

515
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,120
What did we miss?

516
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,830
Well, you guys are confused.

517
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,940
You guys are completely confused.

518
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,680
We had two singers in the drinking group.

519
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,610
But we still don't have any songs in the drinking group.

520
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,910
Well, you guys are still confused.

521
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,220
Hey, I don't know if they can play this when they're so drunk.

522
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,230
So chill.

523
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,910
Just a moment.

524
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,330
I'll bring you a guitar.

525
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:58,960
Hey!

526
00:27:59,290 --> 00:27:59,960
Let me go with you.

527
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,050
Why did he take the beer with him?

528
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't know.

529
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,010
It's all here.

530
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,300
I've put it on.

531
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,060
All here.

532
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,960
The artist's guitar is right here!

533
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,029
You scare me.

534
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,590
You don't make any sound.

535
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,600
Huh?

536
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,100
I told you I would come upstairs with you.

537
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,140
Didn't you hear?

538
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,280
Why do you have to come here?

539
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,800
Just wait downstairs.

540
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,560
It makes you tired for nothing if you come up.

541
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,650
I want to carry the artist's guitar myself.

542
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,810
Please. It's cool.

543
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,020
Well.

544
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,290
Stand up.

545
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,540
Here.

546
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,020
Like this.

547
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,480
Well.

548
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,390
Like this.

549
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,700
And on the other side.

550
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,510
It cannot be reached.

551
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,320
But it's okay.

552
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,320
You're cool now.

553
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,400
Done.

554
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,040
Let's go downstairs.

555
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,120
Here, please eat it.

556
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,640
Thanks.

557
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,120
Do you still want to know my heartbreak story?

558
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,490
Just tell me.

559
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,850
Come close to me.

560
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,740
It's a secret.

561
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,530
I don't want anyone to hear it.

562
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,220
I'm not telling you.

563
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,030
F♪ck!

564
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,500
I'm here.

565
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,790
How am I, P?

566
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,150
Look at me.

567
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,230
Am I cool?

568
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,789
You're really cool.

569
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,070
So cool that you can't find the end point.

570
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,120
Damn cool.

571
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,980
- Non-stop cool.
- Stop.

572
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,760
Why must you be sarcastic to me?

573
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,230
They are good at arguing.

574
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,390
Always.

575
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,980
Here.

576
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,580
It's yours.

577
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,610
Okay, don't let it hit my face.

578
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,040
Come on.

579
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,670
You didn't help me open it.

580
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,720
Just open it. It's your guitar.

581
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,550
Well.

582
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,490
Well, please help me.

583
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,160
Well.

584
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,080
What song would you like to request?

585
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,410
Then I want to listen to the song you sang at the park.

586
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,400
Sure.

587
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,840
♫ I can only look at you ♫

588
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,240
♫ I see you in dreams every night ♫

589
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,580
♫ Whenever I close my eyes, I dream of you ♫

590
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,819
♫ Some pictures brought tears to my eyes ♫

591
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,839
♫ My memories with you ♫

592
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,240
♫ I want to go back to the old days ♫

593
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,780
♫ When we were still in love ♫

594
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:13,099
♫ No matter who I'm with, I still miss you ♫

595
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,000
♫ The more good the memory is, the more painful it is ♫

596
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,069
♫ I never forget you ♫

597
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,599
♫ The old love is still deeply etched in my heart ♫

598
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,500
♫ Every word is still the same as in the past ♫

599
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,380
♫ I know it hurts, but why doesn't it end? ♫

600
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,219
♫ It's painful every time ♫

601
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,330
♫ I just need time to forget it ♫

602
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,520
♫ But don't be longer than this ♫

603
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,029
♫ Just being able to let go for a minute, ♫

604
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,030
♫ I'm pleased ♫

605
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,460
♫ You're a perfect match ♫

606
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,990
♫ that I need ♫

607
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,280
♫ And no matter how long, it's always you ♫

608
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,860
♫ And there's no one else ♫

609
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,140
♫ Change my heart ♫

610
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,340
♫ I love you because you are you ♫

611
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,380
Let's cheers!

612
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,380
Well.

613
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,560
I'm so drunk. Damn.

614
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,400
Let's cheers?

615
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,040
Why do you drink and mess up your mouth?

616
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,240
Damn.

617
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,370
I'll go to bed after I finish my drink.

618
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:00,515
Well.

619
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,220
Hey.

620
00:34:10,471 --> 00:34:11,182
Just go back to your bedroom.

621
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,208
Go back to your bedroom.

622
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:15,608
Go sleep.

623
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:20,008
Well, go.

624
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,980
What about these two?

625
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,150
Let them be.

626
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,670
Hey, I'm going to bed.

627
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,850
I can't stand it.

628
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,800
Where are you going?

629
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:32,920
Going to bed.

630
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:33,850
Right here.

631
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,720
Where do you sleep?

632
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,190
Right here?

633
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,860
I will sleep with you.

634
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:47,902
Beboy.

635
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:49,591
I'm heavy.

636
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,310
I will sleep with you.

637
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,600
I'm heavy. I can't stand it.

638
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:02,960
What are you doing?
