Wow!

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,070
P!

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,090
Yeah.

5
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,800
This is the first time I've seen trees change color.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,990
It's so beautiful!

7
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:53,940
Yeah.

8
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,050
Hey!

9
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,860
Finally, I met you.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,810
Let me hug you fully!

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,170
Hey!

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,670
Beboy.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,980
Should you stop now?

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,130
People will think you're crazy.

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,100
Hey, P.

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,970
Why?

17
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,030
You don't know anything.

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,880
My mom said, trees are the greatest power in the world.

19
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,510
Really?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,420
Yes!

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,610
The greatest power in the world absorbs negative energy

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,820
and emits positive energy.

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,500
It keeps us from stress, good mental health

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,310
and has angels protecting us.

25
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,870
For real?

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,700
Yeah.

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,590
Look at me.

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,080
Yeah.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,570
P!

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,900
I feel so relaxed that words cannot describe it!

31
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,030
Stop it now.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,840
Come here.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,580
Where are you taking me, Beboy?

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,670
Especially you, you should hug trees often.

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,069
So that you can stop your apathy and bad words.

36
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,570
Come here!

37
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,570
Hey. No, Beboy.

38
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:02,650
Beboy, stop.

39
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,450
- Stop.
- Hug it.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,220
Hug now.

41
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,400
Beboy, you...

42
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,970
Take it!

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,410
Stop. Stop. Stop.

44
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:12,700
I surrender. I surrender now.

45
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,140
How was it?

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,010
Do you feel refreshed?

47
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,550
What damn do you mean refreshing?

48
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,660
Just wait till it's my turn. Damn.

49
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,920
- Hey.
- My clothes are stained.

50
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,720
- Hold on.
- Why?

51
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,620
Where are you going?

52
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,120
What do you want me to do?

53
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,920
Please take a photo for me.

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,580
Take a photo?

55
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,130
Yes!

56
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,200
Sure.

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,420
Take a photo, right?

58
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,910
Come on.

59
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,150
Please pose quickly.

60
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,330
Hurry up!

61
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,390
What's wrong with you?

62
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:41,480
Just take a photo for you.

63
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,470
Why are you smiling?

64
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,050
Well, let's start posing.

65
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,080
Ready?

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,850
Yeah, I'm ready.

67
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:47,980
Well.

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,030
Pose coolly.

69
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,510
Well.

70
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah.

71
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,510
Why are you smiling?

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,330
Just focus on your poses.

73
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,090
I'm taking a photo for you.

74
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,830
Okay.

75
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,810
Well.

76
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,920
Is it good?

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,460
Yeah.

78
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,800
Let me check the pictures.

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
So damn good.

80
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Here.

81
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,450
It came out really well.

82
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,570
F♪ck! P!

83
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,300
What the f♪ck did you take pictures of?

84
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,030
Gosh, P!

85
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,170
The ambience here is so damn good.

86
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,650
It has only one disadvantage.

87
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:23,440
I can't communicate with anyone, P.

88
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,750
Hey, Beboy.

89
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,040
There are a lot of translation apps these days, aren't there?

90
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,630
Just install it.

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,050
It's very chill here.

92
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,170
I can stay here all day and not go anywhere.

93
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,380
Look at these trees.

94
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,770
It's more than the garden around my house.

95
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,310
Hey, this is just in the city.

96
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,100
If you went outside the city center,

97
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,910
wouldn't you be shocked to death?

98
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,850
So what?

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,420
I told you to come here a long time ago.

100
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,480
You keep procrastinating.

101
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,880
Outside the city center?

102
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,730
Other cities have more trees?

103
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,550
Yeah.

104
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,940
Please take me there next time.

105
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,100
Please, P?

106
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,530
- Please? Please? Please?
- I get it.

107
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,250
Stop!

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,390
My arm is falling off. Damn.

109
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,940
Damn!, gargantuan!

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,540
What did he say?

111
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,020
Come here!

112
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,070
Hey, Beboy, where are you going?

113
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,240
Come here.

114
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,609
Ouch, Beboy.

115
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,430
Please take a photo for me!

116
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,250
Here!

117
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,910
Please take a picture of me with this rock.

118
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,210
It's not a rock. It's a statue.

119
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,040
That's it, the statue.

120
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,920
Please take a photo for me.

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,580
Why are you excited? It's just a statue.

122
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,890
This is Japan.

123
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,980
That place is Thailand.

124
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,290
I want to take a picture with this rock. Okay?

125
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,100
Please. Please.

126
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,680
It's a statue.

127
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:47,690
Yeah. That's it.

128
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,900
Come on.

129
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:50,110
Please take pictures properly.

130
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,850
Well, I'm not teasing you anymore.

131
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,250
It's even more suspicious that you said that.

132
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,880
Well, come on.

133
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,560
Come on.

134
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,820
Smile.

135
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,010
Please take many pictures, dude.

136
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,650
I took about a hundred pictures of it.

137
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,540
Is it good? Good?

138
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,780
Here.

139
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,480
Here.

140
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,050
Here.

141
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,560
Beboy, don't move too much.

142
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,670
I can't focus in time.

143
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,890
One more picture.

144
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,500
Here.

145
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,490
This picture is okay.

146
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:22,580
- It's beautiful too.
- Where?

147
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,270
Look at this!

148
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,510
Yeah.

149
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:26,510
I will upload this picture on IG.

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,030
And set it as my profile picture.

151
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,240
You don't need to hurry.

152
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,190
You're right.

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,300
Then I'll change my mind and send it to my mom.

154
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,290
So that she will know that I have arrived.

155
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,050
Yeah.

156
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,460
This picture.

157
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,680
Hold on.

158
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,590
I'm curious.

159
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,290
Why are you in such a hurry to send it to your mom?

160
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,390
Why don't you just bring your mom here?

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,250
You tell her everything.

162
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,090
You don't know anything.

163
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,939
If she comes here.

164
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,090
You definitely need to make a trip to several magical temples.

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,980
Are you interested?

166
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
Beboy.

167
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,770
Don't bring your mom here, okay?

168
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,670
Sure.

169
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,120
Come on.

170
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,440
Let's take a photo and send it to my mom.

171
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,949
I haven't posed yet. Take another photo!

172
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,690
Just smile!

173
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,460
- Yeah.
- Smile. Smile.

174
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,600
1, 2, 3!

175
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,580
This picture is okay.

176
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,030
Yeah.

177
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,010
Let's go.

178
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,929
Hello, everyone.

179
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,789
We are now at Yoyogi Park in Japan.

180
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,100
Well, what song will we cover today?

181
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,000
Miss you and From someone who has never been in love.

182
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,139
First of all, I will show you how beautiful the surrounding garden is.

183
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,460
Let's go.

184
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,990
Let's see that.

185
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,570
Wow, do you like it?

186
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,380
Bye bye.

187
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,530
Is it beautiful?

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh!

189
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,030
So sorry about that.

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,750
Sorry.

191
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Plai!

192
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,790
Please look carefully.

193
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,670
You are focused on your camera.

194
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,459
I don't see him.

195
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,440
You bump into other people.

196
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,620
Damn!

197
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,839
Why didn't you tell me?

198
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,559
- What do I have to say? You are walking.
- I'm taking a video.

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,950
I'm looking at my guitar.

200
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,450
Hey, Beboy.

201
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,410
What?

202
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,860
Where do you get your energy from?

203
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,290
I can't.

204
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,070
I'm here just 5 days.

205
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,290
I have to make the trip worthwhile.

206
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,260
Yeah, up to you.

207
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,780
It's good that today is a work day,

208
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,090
so there aren't many people.

209
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,890
Uh.

210
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,360
It's better if you save your memory space and battery.

211
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
We still have to travel to many places.

212
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,940
I think I'll take you to...

213
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,090
Harajuku.

214
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,990
P!

215
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,960
I've heard of that area!

216
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,730
Yeah.

217
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,040
From comics and movies.

218
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,530
They say Harajuku

219
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,380
is so kawaii, right?

220
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,210
Right?

221
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,040
Yes.

222
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,700
But...

223
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,100
Is it far?

224
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,810
It's far.

225
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:21,820
But it's not a problem.

226
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,000
Because Japanese tourist attractions are near train stations.

227
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,890
Trains in Japan are punctual.

228
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,450
They do not exceed their time or lack it.

229
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,800
Hey.

230
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,020
Good.

231
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,220
Uh.

232
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,630
Are you taking me to just one place today?

233
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,340
Don't forget.

234
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,110
I'm here just a few days.

235
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,279
It's worth it in just one place.

236
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,840
Did you know that Harajuku is close to temples, shrines, and shopping areas?

237
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,450
There are many.

238
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,800
I can tell that you will be able to take many photos.

239
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,890
Don't worry.

240
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,030
Do you know?

241
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,200
Before coming here, I bought 5 memory cards.

242
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,460
I've already planned it.

243
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,510
If I don't make all 5 memories full.

244
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,510
I will definitely not return to Thailand.

245
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,780
I'll take pictures of everything.

246
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,730
Yeah.

247
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,980
That's you.

248
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,050
Hey.

249
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,110
I will make your 5 memory cards full in the remaining days.

250
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,880
Great, dude!

251
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah.

252
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,720
Hey, P!

253
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,300
Yeah.

254
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,800
Don't forget it.

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,570
You have to take me shopping.

256
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,170
My mom's souvenir list is very long.

257
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,330
I shouldn't have told her if I knew.

258
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,430
I don't forget it.

259
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,510
You can shop another day.

260
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,300
It's messy.

261
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,850
Okay.

262
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,910
P!

263
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,850
It's so beautiful.

264
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,540
Do you like it?

265
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,650
This place is unusual.

266
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,570
Yeah.

267
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,250
It has many more in front.

268
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,950
Are you interested?

269
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,460
Sure!

270
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,030
Let's go.

271
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,790
P, I'm hungry.

272
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,790
Can we find something light to eat first?

273
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,600
Yeah.

274
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,490
It has a delicious restaurant in front. I'll take you to...

275
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,910
What's wrong with you?

276
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,830
They are very cool.

277
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,360
I should have brought a selfie stick if I'd known that.

278
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,340
My friend wants to be a YouTuber.

279
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,580
♫ That love is still deep in my heart ♫

280
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,700
♫ every word is still the same as in the past ♫

281
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,180
♫ I know it hurts, but why doesn't it end? ♫

282
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,769
♫ It's painful every time ♫

283
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,930
If you ask if we can do it, we probably will.

284
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,370
But making noise in public like this in Japan,

285
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,430
I think it's not okay.

286
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,800
Because Japanese people are very strict in their manners.

287
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,920
They just want to relax in a quiet place on vacation.

288
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,200
Most people think that this kind of behavior is bad manners.

289
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,070
Really?

290
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,980
Yeah.

291
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,680
Hey.

292
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,540
If you do something like this,

293
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,539
I will send you back to Thailand today.

294
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,230
Be careful.

295
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,580
Yeah, I don't do it.

296
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,530
Those two people...

297
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,960
They had money to travel to Japan,

298
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,800
if they studied Japanese etiquette on the internet

299
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,860
they wouldn't do such rude things.

300
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,720
Look at them.

301
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,360
P.

302
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,890
Come here. Do you want to eat?

303
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,450
Yeah.

304
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,020
Plai.

305
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,070
What photos did you take?

306
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,890
Let me see.

307
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,070
Do you see it?

308
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,290
It's blurry and dark.

309
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,230
Can you see that it's backlit?

310
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,910
Did you see which way the sun was shining when taking the photo?

311
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,620
Look, my face is dark like a person who has been affected by black magic.

312
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
It's so blurry.

313
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,280
You're right.

314
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,060
Damn. Why is it like this?

315
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,480
Don't tell me you didn't look at it from the beginning.

316
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,610
Crazy.

317
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,510
Will I forget it?

318
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,470
But why is it so dark?

319
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,150
I check it all the time.

320
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,210
While I was taking photos, the screen was normal.

321
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,470
What damn do you mean when you say it's normal?

322
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,530
What photos did you take?

323
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,580
Look at this.

324
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,410
Hey, Beboy.

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,250
Please hold it carefully.

326
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,020
You act like you can't hold it.

327
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,820
If you're tired, just go home and sleep.

328
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,180
I'm holding it carefully.

329
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,670
It has many things.

330
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,070
I told you not to buy too much.

331
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,420
Why do you have to buy so many things at once?

332
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,150
I don't want to walk many times.

333
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,280
Why?

334
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,170
Have you never dropped something?

335
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,730
You really give me a headache.

336
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,430
What kind of picture is this?

337
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,930
It's very messy.

338
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,490
There aren't any pretty pictures.

339
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,210
It's really a waste of memory space.

340
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,400
People can make mistakes, aren't they?

341
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,000
If you're good at it,

342
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,050
just do it yourself next time.

343
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,660
Hey.

344
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,050
Who are you insulting?

345
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,090
Huh?

346
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,530
What do you mean?

347
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,480
Your friend says, "Why are you such a complainer?"

348
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,250
"If you're good at it, why don't you do it yourself next time?"

349
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,400
I heard it like this.

350
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,250
Who are you talking about?

351
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,060
Hey!

352
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,990
I'm the one who said it.

353
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,110
He always complains that I drop things.

354
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,900
So I insulted him back.

355
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,870
But...

356
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,950
did you guys hear it?

357
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,750
Do you guys have any problems?

358
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,410
Nothing.

359
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,790
I just argued with my younger brother.

360
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,590
I accidentally heard it,

361
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,620
so...

362
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,690
So you think we are insulting you?

363
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,770
Yeah.

364
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,970
Hey.

365
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,970
Hey, calm down.

366
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,170
It's not what you think. You can feel at ease.

367
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,300
But if I misunderstood you,

368
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,570
I apologize.

369
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,370
I'll go now.

370
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,620
Let's go!

371
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,580
Hey, calm down.

372
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,570
Yeah.

373
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,730
They're just talking to each other.

374
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,810
(Jiyugaoka Sweets Forest)

375
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:48,970
Hey.

376
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,090
It's here.

377
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,540
What is that?

378
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,890
Here.

379
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,500
This is the signature cake of this cafe.

380
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,230
Taste it.

381
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,090
I'll scoop it up now?

382
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,260
Yeah. Here.

383
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,540
How was it?

384
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,820
Tasty!

385
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,910
You have good taste.

386
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,480
Are you surprised?

387
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,260
I told you.

388
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,140
So good.

389
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,760
I think of my mom when I see the cake.

390
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,050
Yeah.

391
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,070
I'd like to buy her two boxes.

392
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,830
Just a moment.

393
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,780
Hey. Hold on.

394
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,570
Why?

395
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,909
Are you crazy, Beboy?

396
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,730
Stop it.

397
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,010
If you buy it now, your mom won't eat the cake.

398
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,370
Instead, she will be given water.

399
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,170
Until you get back to Thailand, it all melts.

400
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,890
You're right.

401
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,960
So... I'll take a photo and send it to her.

402
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,700
Yeah.

403
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,540
Hey.

404
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,380
It won't be beautiful.

405
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,289
There should be a drink next to the cake.

406
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,150
Drink.

407
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,950
Take it.

408
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,760
It's beautiful.

409
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,040
Is it okay?

410
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,660
Yeah.

411
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,490
What?

412
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,900
Hey, you twins!

413
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,060
What's wrong?

414
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,210
They are Thai people like us, it's okay.

415
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,560
Come on. Sit with us.

416
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,620
Come here.

417
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,210
Both of you.

418
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,130
Come here.

419
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,400
Huh?

420
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,130
Sit here.

421
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,360
Just chill.

422
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,570
Sit here.

423
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,570
Don't be considerate.

424
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,140
Just relax.

425
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,470
It's okay. We are Thai people.

426
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,310
Let's find a hotel.

427
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,170
Didn't you just argue with them?

428
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,880
Huh?

429
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,310
Alright.

430
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,780
They are Thai people.

431
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,030
It's okay.

432
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,250
Just relax.

433
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,170
Here?

434
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,960
Click it.

435
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,370
Well.

436
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,560
Address...

437
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,490
Every hotel is full.

438
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,360
Which hotel are you guys staying at?

439
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,290
Oh, I don't know yet.

440
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,510
We are having a problem with the hotel.

441
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,160
Why?

442
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,290
Didn't you book a hotel before traveling?

443
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,850
We do.

444
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,970
We booked the hotel on the wrong day.

445
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,090
So we have to find a new hotel now.

446
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,110
It's really hard.

447
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,120
Have you found a hotel yet?

448
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,980
Not yet.

449
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,450
We are looking for it.

450
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,740
Does that mean you won't have a place to sleep if you can't find a hotel?

451
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,850
Yeah.

452
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,080
Maybe.

453
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:11,810
P.

454
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,280
What?

455
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,740
Do you know any hotels or apartments around here?

456
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,290
Here?

457
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,490
But it's very expensive here.

458
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,990
Just check it first.

459
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,520
Really?

460
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,010
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

461
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,600
It's full.

462
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,290
Huh?

463
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,340
It's full even though it's expensive?

464
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,430
I think so.

465
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,460
Let's check somewhere else.

466
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,040
There are no other hotels.

467
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,870
Do you guys want to stay at P's house first?

468
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,490
Okay?

469
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,540
Beboy!

470
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,560
Have you asked me yet?

471
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,350
It's okay.

472
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,710
Yes.

473
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,340
I'll try to find a hotel that is far from the train station.

474
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,950
But it's not sure, right?

475
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,450
Alright.

476
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,880
Your house is spacious.

477
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,450
Your house even has three floors.

478
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,880
What's the big deal about adding two people?

479
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,170
But you...

480
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,460
How many days are you traveling?

481
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,660
I think I'll travel for 5 days and return on the 6th.

482
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,720
That's it!

483
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,840
That's it!

484
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,560
You have the same flight as me.

485
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,720
Good.

486
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,360
Having many friends to travel with is fun.

487
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,180
Right?

488
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,440
What the f♪ck 'Right?'

489
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,910
Have you ever asked my opinion?

490
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,490
Hey, it's okay.

491
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,280
Yes.

492
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,770
Thank you, but I don't want to bother you.

493
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,710
Alright, P.

494
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,190
I beg you.

495
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,450
So that you don't have to worry about me.

496
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,800
Moreover, they are Thai people.

497
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,090
Are you going to let them
freeze to death on the side of the road?

498
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,750
Huh?

499
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,160
Please, P.

500
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:57,530
Please. Please. Please.

501
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,650
Please.

502
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,480
Okay?

503
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,660
Well.

504
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Up to you.

505
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,390
Wow.

506
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,750
P!

507
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,330
P!

508
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,370
P!

509
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,089
Why? Why are you making noise?

510
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,990
I want this one.

511
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,440
You're really...

512
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,620
You want to play the gachapon machine as soon as you see it.

513
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,770
You don't need to hurry.

514
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,800
- P.
- Let's take the luggage to my house first.

515
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,140
You don't know anything.

516
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,390
Do you know?

517
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,780
If we want to know whether the trip will go well or not,

518
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,050
we have to check it from the first time we draw of the gachapon.

519
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,010
If I get what I want,

520
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,500
the trip will be fun and smooth.

521
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,380
Everything will go smoothly no matter what I do.

522
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,370
But if I randomly get something I don't want,

523
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,180
the trip will be bumpy, not smooth, rough.

524
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,240
Hold on.

525
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,130
Who told you?

526
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,910
Myself.

527
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,300
Hey.

528
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,370
Wait for me!

529
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,480
Come here.

530
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,000
We've arrived!

531
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,780
This is Mr. P's castle, guys.

532
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,710
We've arrived.

533
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,210
Hey.

534
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,330
Beboy.

535
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,460
Don't exaggerate. It's my house.

536
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,850
I forgot it.

537
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,840
P. Beboy.

538
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,900
Thank you.

539
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,490
T... Thank you.

540
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
Yeah. It's okay.

541
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,770
Hey.

542
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,410
You didn't say this just now.

543
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,760
Just be quiet.

544
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,240
Come in quickly.

545
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,160
Hey!

546
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,520
Please come this way, homeowner.

547
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,300
Let's go inside.

548
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,550
Hey, that's scary.

549
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,770
Will we get scammed by them?

550
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:17,730
I think so.

551
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,520
But we have no place to stay tonight.

552
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,620
Yes.

553
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,210
Hey, why don't you guys come in?

554
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,920
Come on!

555
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,090
It's quite narrow.

556
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,690
Come in.

557
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,610
Close the door!

558
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,170
Yeah.

559
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,170
You guys sit here.

560
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,130
We are going to live together.

561
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,890
I haven't introduced myself to you yet.

562
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,880
I'm Pan, the older twin.

563
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,360
I'm Plai, the younger twin.

564
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,480
Nice to meet you.

565
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,670
You...

566
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,590
I'm Beboy.

567
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,130
I am a very close friend of P.

568
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,780
I'm P.

569
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,080
Your house is not small.

570
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,300
Do you live alone?

571
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,050
Yeah.

572
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,850
Normally, I usually lounge and watch TV around here.

573
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,780
My bedroom is on the second floor.

574
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,320
I clean the third floor once a week.

575
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,000
Wow.

576
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,990
You are alone, aren't you lonely?

577
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,070
I used to in the beginning.

578
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,850
I've been thinking about getting housemates to rent a house.

579
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,160
But after I thought about it again...

580
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,940
I don't want it.

581
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,720
I don't like living with anyone.

582
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,650
Besides, I don't know if people these days can be trusted.

583
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,570
Your water.

584
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,330
Thank you.

585
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,260
What about mine?

586
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,800
They are guests.

587
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,050
He can't be with anyone that much.

588
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,920
He is a suspicious, complainer, and strict person.

589
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,570
And he is a very private person.

590
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,970
Please be patient with him if you stay here.

591
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,560
Don't be too much.

592
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,090
Beboy.

593
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,500
You gossip about me while I'm here.

594
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,840
Uh.

595
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,140
The two of you, sit here first.

596
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,170
I will clean your room for you.

597
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,810
Hey.

598
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,860
It's okay.

599
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,290
Just tell us, and we will do it ourselves.

600
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,900
Hey, that's okay.

601
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,920
It's better to let P do it.

602
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,880
He knows where his cleaning supplies are in the house.

603
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,080
So that it will end quickly.

604
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,150
So that we can travel together.

605
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,990
We can help you.

606
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,450
It's okay.

607
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,860
I will do it myself.

608
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,310
P.

609
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,370
What about me?

610
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,910
Do I have to help you?

611
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,100
Beboy.

612
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,700
Sit here.

613
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,730
Please stay with Pan and Plai.

614
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,730
You're just my burden.

615
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,180
Keep an eye on them.

616
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,210
He is here.

617
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,540
Done.

618
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,860
You can arrange your luggage now.

619
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,240
Thank you.

620
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,400
How was it?

621
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,360
You can stay here, right?

622
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,780
Of course.

623
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,720
So fine.

624
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,000
Uh.

625
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,600
The bathroom is outside.

626
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,970
You can see it immediately if you walk out.

627
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,650
Your suitcase.

628
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,220
My room is next to yours.

629
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,330
You can knock on my door if you need anything more.

630
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,980
Okay.

631
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,770
Uh, just arrange your baggage first.

632
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,710
Follow me after you're done.

633
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,060
Okay?

634
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,010
Okay.

635
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,220
Wow.

636
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,960
The room is really great.

637
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,610
The bed was very soft.

638
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,510
If this were a hotel, this room would be very expensive.

639
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,910
Yes.

640
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,710
We were very lucky to meet P and Beboy.

641
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,580
Otherwise, I don't know where we will sleep tonight.

642
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,880
Yes.

643
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,190
The bed was very soft.

644
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,760
This pillow too.

645
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,240
Air conditioning too.

646
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,770
Wow!

647
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,250
Around here there are only people's houses.

648
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,140
But it's very strange.

649
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,430
It's very silent.

650
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,290
Neighbors don't talk to each other at all?

651
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,490
Maybe they just want some privacy?

652
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,860
You keep talking too much.
Just hurry and arrange your things!

653
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,090
So that we can go downstairs.

654
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,110
I know.

655
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,540
P!

656
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,170
What?

657
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,730
P.

658
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,810
Let me borrow your notebook to upload pictures.

659
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:53,850
Hey.

660
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,160
Beboy.

661
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,270
You should ask me before using it next time.

662
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,800
Alright, we are friends.

663
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,940
F♪ck.

664
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,210
I forgot.

665
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,770
I forgot to call my mom.

666
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:10,970
Let me call her for a moment.

667
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,680
Hello.

668
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,040
Hello, what are you doing ma'am?

669
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,500
Hi, dear.

670
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,090
I've been wanting to call to say I've been here for a while.

671
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,700
How was it? Did you have fun?

672
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,490
Yeah... it's fun, mom.

673
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,350
Right now I'm in the capital called Tokyo.

674
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,210
Right?

675
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,810
Yes.

676
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,030
It is the capital.

677
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,270
There are a lot of parks here.

678
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,220
The weather here is shady and very nice.

679
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,570
More importantly, I don't have to open the door myself when taking a taxi.

680
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,020
It's an automatic door.

681
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,970
I'm surprised.

682
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,460
The food here is fresh and delicious.

683
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,570
So I miss you, mom.

684
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,870
I think you will like it if you come here.

685
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,440
Have you traveled anywhere yet?

686
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,670
Not yet.

687
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,130
I'm staying at P's house.

688
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,320
I'm going to hang out in a while.

689
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,450
Well, take good care of yourself, dear.

690
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,400
Please send me your photos.

691
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,980
So that I can talk to my neighbors.

692
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,220
Sure.

693
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,490
Oh, I almost forgot to mention it.

694
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,310
Today I met two Thai people.

695
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,890
They are twins.

696
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,850
When I asked what problem they had,

697
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,070
it seemed like they had a problem with their hotel booking or something.

698
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,730
Yeah.

699
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,370
So I asked them to stay with me.

700
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,670
It's P's house.

701
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,320
At first, P rejected it with all his might.

702
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,860
I kept persuading him.

703
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,850
I talked and convinced him, in the end he gave in.

704
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,970
Mom, we are Thai people.

705
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,420
How can we leave them struggling abroad?

706
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,570
They are very pitiful.

707
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,960
They're pathetic, right? Mom.

708
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,550
- I would like to say...
- Beboy.

709
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,090
What?

710
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,610
These twins have another story.

711
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,800
When we were at the cafe...

712
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,970
What?

713
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,180
Damn!

714
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,270
Hello, mom.

715
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,940
P has been poking me for a while now.

716
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,760
It seems like he might have a problem with the weather.

717
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,840
It's a recurring problem for beer drinkers.

718
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,980
It makes his health weak.

719
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,180
I'll call you back later.

720
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:36,900
Love you mom.

721
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,530
Xoxo.

722
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,440
P.

723
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,390
Have they been here long?

724
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,850
They've heard you complain about it
to your mom for about a hundred years.

725
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:53,980
Oh!

726
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,350
I suddenly had a stomach ache, P.

727
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,360
I have a stomach ache.

728
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,070
I have to go to the bathroom. It seems like I want to poop.

729
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,860
Don't mind about him.

730
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,410
He's just talking nonsense.

731
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,960
It's nothing much.

732
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,850
It's okay.

733
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,260
You stupid mouth!

734
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,000
You stupid mouth!

735
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,910
You're a zipper-mouthed bastard!

736
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,940
You're a zipper-mouthed bastard!

737
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,940
What did I just say?

738
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,630
Damn.

739
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,810
Beboy!

740
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,550
Are you finished yet? I want to use the bathroom.

741
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,030
I'm about to pee.

742
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,300
Yeah!

743
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,500
Just a moment!

744
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,220
Yeah.

745
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,930
It's okay now. You can relax your mind.

746
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,710
Please be careful next time you say something.

747
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,400
Get out, I need to pee!

748
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,060
P.

749
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,060
Yeah.

750
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,410
P!

751
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,400
What?

752
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,850
I'll walk out with you.

753
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,460
Yeah.

754
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,780
Are you done?

755
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,790
Yeah.

756
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,040
Go!

757
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,980
It's nothing much.

758
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,340
The reason I've gathered all of you together here

759
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,500
is to tell you some rules

760
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,780
that you must follow

761
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,830
when we share this house together.

762
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,230
Firstly.

763
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,350
I want you to pay house fees for the 6 days here.

764
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,100
Secondly.

765
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,070
Do not make the house dirty.

766
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,590
Thirdly.

767
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:27,820
You have to flush the toilet every time for every poop.

768
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,780
Fourthly.

769
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,410
Before peeing, lift the toilet lid every time.

770
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,000
And don't let there be pee on the floor.

771
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,510
It is strictly prohibited.

772
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,460
Fifthly.

773
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,290
If the mirror fogs up when you take a shower,

774
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,050
you need to wipe it!

775
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,950
And sixth.

776
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,560
Lastly.

777
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,930
If your feet are wet,

778
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,540
you must wipe them dry every time.

779
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,230
Before you step on the floor.

780
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,020
I hope

781
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,890
you

782
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,960
you

783
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,110
and you

784
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,590
can understand

785
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,560
and follow it.

786
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,020
You're not confused, right?

787
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,510
It's you who's confused.
