00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,670
You first.

3
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,490
It's okay.

4
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,310
You first.

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,890
You first.

6
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,520
It's okay. You first.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,790
You first.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,660
So I'll take this bottle.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,210
Take it.

10
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,220
It's all only in Japanese.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,660
How can P understand it?

12
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,750
Right?

13
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,810
Sit here.

14
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,820
Do you want to eat it?

15
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,210
No.

16
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,200
Please eat it.

17
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,080
What time is it now?

18
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,080
They haven't come down yet?

19
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,090
Where is Pan?

20
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
He's dressing.

21
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,860
He would probably come down soon.

22
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,810
I'm so sleepy.

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,490
Hi, Pan.

24
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,620
Did you sleep well last night?

25
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,190
Yeah.

26
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,830
But I don't want to wake up.

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,470
The weather is really nice.

28
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,910
Yes.

29
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,670
If there's no traveling, I don't know if I'll wake up at noon.

30
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,220
Yeah.

31
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,120
Where is P?

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,350
I don't know.

33
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,100
What are you doing, Plai?

34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,060
I drink water.

35
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,230
What do you mean you drink water?

36
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,890
I see you keep holding onto the bottle cap.

37
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,230
It's not your business.

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,940
Do you want it?

39
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,240
Thank you.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,270
It's really comfortable.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,130
Where is P?

42
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,840
Has he not come down yet?

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,920
It's now 8 a.m.

44
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,550
He was even the one who made the appointment.

45
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,690
He keeps dictating.

46
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,900
You guys are late.

47
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,230
I won't wait for you guys.

48
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,000
If you are late for even one second.

49
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,800
Right?

50
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,410
Look at him.

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,610
He still hasn't come down.

52
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,580
I should call him.

53
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,260
P!

54
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,830
P!

55
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,910
Wake up!

56
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,550
It's now 8 a.m. You still haven't come down?

57
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,150
P!

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
Wake up!

59
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm here.

60
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,500
Beboy.

61
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,670
You're really loud.

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Neighbors might scold me.

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,970
Please check your watch.

64
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,770
It's already 8 a.m.

65
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,030
You made an appointment at 7:00 a.m.

66
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,900
For what?

67
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,380
Yeah.

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,630
I'm just hungover.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,360
It seems I drank too much last night.

70
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,520
So take this one.

71
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,450
It's a warm one.

72
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,530
Well, thank you.

73
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,200
Now it's a little better.

74
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,470
Hey.

75
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,070
Don't you guys have any hangovers?

76
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,070
What about you, Beboy?

77
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,280
No.

78
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,180
You're just weak, P.

79
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,430
Nosy.

80
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,750
Well, let's go.

81
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,880
Go!

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,940
Let's go!

83
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,550
I told you to lower your voice.

84
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,290
Yeah.

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,750
Go.

86
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,149
(Tsukiji station)

87
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,319
(Tsukiji Market)

88
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,230
This is Tsukiji Fish Market.

89
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,180
It's my regular food source.

90
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,290
What is this place famous for?

91
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,059
Fish markets should be famous about fish.

92
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,300
This place is famous for fresh fish and sashimi.

93
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,910
There are many shops here.

94
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,670
- Look, there's a huge crowd.
- You're right.

95
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,070
It has a lot of people.

96
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,320
Hey, are you guys still okay?

97
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,320
Shall we go for a walk first and eat later?

98
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,090
- Sure.
- Go!

99
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,910
Go!

100
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,310
Hey, Beboy.

101
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,400
Do you keep taking photos until your memory is full?

102
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,330
Did you take 10,000 photos?

103
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,170
I don't know.

104
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,530
There are hundreds of pictures.

105
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:09,800
Hey.

106
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,800
Among the hundreds of pictures, is there a picture of us?

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,930
Sure!

108
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,020
Do you want to check it?

109
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,620
Here.

110
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,590
No.

111
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,790
I'll check at home. It's a waste of time. Damn.

112
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,650
Guys.

113
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,769
There are many shops here.

114
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,110
Yeah.

115
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,850
I tasted until I was almost full.

116
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,330
Yes, and what they sell is very fresh.

117
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,010
Moreover, it's inexpensive.

118
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,660
Yes, they sell fresh and cheap fish.

119
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,200
So I usually buy it to eat at home.

120
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,530
Awesome.

121
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,130
Is there any chance I can eat your food?

122
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,410
Hey, let's go. I'm hungry.

123
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,060
Let's find some heavy food.

124
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,990
Good idea.

125
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,240
Is it delicious?

126
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,700
Yes. Here.

127
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,030
I'm eating it.

128
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,280
Let's go.

129
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
Hey, what restaurant is this?

130
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,570
Hey, just go in first.

131
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,110
It's really livable.

132
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,980
- It's so strange.
- It looks tasty.

133
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,390
I can guarantee it's great.

134
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,480
Really?

135
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,290
Yeah.

136
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,310
Come on.

137
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,490
- Where?
- Look at the menu.

138
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,590
Well.

139
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,870
Here, your menu.

140
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,140
Please send me the menu.

141
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,410
Wow.

142
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,710
What should I eat?

143
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,730
Pan.

144
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,230
Huh?

145
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,310
Can you read the menu?

146
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,460
No.

147
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,170
What about you?

148
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,700
How can I read it?

149
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,250
It's all in Japanese.

150
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,750
Let's do this.

151
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,170
I'll order it for you first for this time.

152
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,420
Yeah.

153
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,050
What do you guys want to eat?

154
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,330
I don't know yet,

155
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,580
that what I want to eat.

156
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,100
Let's do this.

157
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,970
Just choose for us.

158
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,780
I will follow you.

159
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,090
Okay.

160
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,620
So I'll order for you first for this time.

161
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,270
Hey!

162
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,310
But I won't treat you.

163
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,100
Yeah.

164
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,360
What?

165
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,710
Excuse me.

166
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,540
Do you have any recommendations?

167
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,700
I recommend this yayoi noodle.

168
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,120
Is it Yayoi noodles?

169
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,730
Well.

170
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,600
Let's see.

171
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,910
Four yayoi noodles, please.

172
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,789
Yes, please.

173
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,100
Okay.

174
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,760
So cool.

175
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
So cool.

176
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,440
Wow, you speak Japanese.

177
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,820
Mr. P.

178
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,900
P!

179
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,510
What?

180
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,130
People behind us.

181
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,660
She is a Japanese idol.

182
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,570
Really?

183
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,120
Yes.

184
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,950
I want to take a picture with her.

185
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,460
I'll send the picture to my mom.

186
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,930
Sure.

187
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,630
Hello.

188
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,360
Hello.

189
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,620
I want to take a picture. Can you take a photo with us?

190
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,530
Okay.

191
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,220
Yes.

192
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,689
- Okay?
- Yes.

193
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,120
Go.

194
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,770
Your camera.

195
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,500
She allowed it.

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,230
Walk to her.

197
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,720
Beboy.

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,910
Well!

199
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,670
1, 2, 3!

200
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,149
Well, thank you so much.

201
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,760
Thank you so much.

202
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,600
Would you like to see pictures?

203
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,580
Send it to me.

204
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,810
You're too much, Beboy.

205
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:39,990
Did it come out well?

206
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,700
Did it come out well?

207
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,970
Good.

208
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,910
The best, dude.

209
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,910
Don't forget to send it to your mom.

210
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,560
It looks delicious, right? It has soup.

211
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,530
What drink should I order?

212
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,950
Thank you so much.

213
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,490
Looks delicious.

214
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,170
Be appetizing.

215
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,130
Well.

216
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,690
Thank you so much.

217
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,650
It's hot.

218
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,950
Please pass me the chopsticks.

219
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,290
P.

220
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,370
What?

221
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,980
Can I eat it?

222
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,120
Why?

223
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,560
It only has vegetables.

224
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,860
Beboy.

225
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,410
You are always picky.

226
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,260
Hey, I'll tell you something.

227
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,340
This is Tsukiji Fish Market.

228
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,520
It should have outstanding and popular sashimi.

229
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,690
But this is the most famous ramen restaurant in this area.

230
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,840
If it wasn't really delicious, it wouldn't be this famous.

231
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,340
But I've never eaten it before.

232
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,980
Normally, I only eat Thai noodles.

233
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,100
P.

234
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,940
Can you order another menu for me?

235
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,180
If it doesn't taste good, you have to order another menu for me.

236
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,440
Alright, I know. Just taste it first.

237
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,380
Please try some.

238
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,160
I guarantee you will love it.

239
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,320
I'll tell you, it's definitely great.

240
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,020
Well.

241
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,700
This place is famous for its quality.

242
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,170
If you don't eat, you'll miss out on good food.

243
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,650
Huh?

244
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,180
Eat now.

245
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:41,400
You are silent.

246
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,030
Well.

247
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,790
I'll eat it.

248
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,750
But if it doesn't taste good, order another menu for me.

249
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,120
Alright, I know. I'll order it for you.

250
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,630
How does it taste?

251
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,050
It's so delicious!

252
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,740
Hey, guys!

253
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,300
We have arrived at the temple!

254
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,950
Come on!

255
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,230
Let's take a walk to digest our food here.

256
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,680
This is Kaneichi Temple.

257
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,850
In the past, this was the large base of the last shogun.

258
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,320
And many shoguns are buried here.

259
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:41,600
Hey.

260
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:41,960
Yeah.

261
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,760
Really?

262
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,010
It used to be a burial ground?

263
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,190
But why doesn't this place seem scary?

264
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,160
On the contrary, it's shady.

265
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,720
Cool.

266
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,150
It's suitable for composing music with a very chill vibe.

267
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,980
I think if we sit here for a long time, we can compose many songs.

268
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,470
Yeah.

269
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,170
But I think the atmosphere here is more pleasant to sleep.

270
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,360
Hey, Beboy.

271
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,350
I take you out on a trip.

272
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,250
Just go back and sleep at your house.

273
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,730
Come here.

274
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,960
Where are you going?

275
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,600
Please take a photo for me.

276
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,250
Just a moment.

277
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,700
What? No, I don't like taking pictures.

278
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,730
You are lying.

279
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,840
I saw you took a photo for Pan at the park.

280
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,300
Liar.

281
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,270
Just take it yourself.

282
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,490
You have a tripod.

283
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,850
No.

284
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,280
I want you to take a photo for me.

285
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,340
No.

286
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,310
Go.

287
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:35,980
Go.

288
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:38,200
Beboy.

289
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,570
Take me with you!

290
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,270
Yeah.

291
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,380
You startled me.

292
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,640
I almost fell.

293
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,890
How do you feel?

294
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,900
Is it chill?

295
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,780
You like it, right?

296
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,700
I really like it.

297
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,080
Uh, I want to know something.

298
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,480
How long does it take you to write songs?

299
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,210
It depends.

300
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,650
It cannot be determined for an exact period.

301
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,530
Some songs take months to compose.

302
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,460
But for some songs,

303
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,810
if I'm in a nice and calm place,

304
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,340
I can finish them in an hour.

305
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,100
Since you arrived in Japan,

306
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,340
how many songs have you composed?

307
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,380
I haven't started it yet.

308
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,930
I only plan to travel here.

309
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,780
And film content, or a beautiful atmosphere.

310
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,530
But on the other hand,

311
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,010
the atmosphere in Japan is really good.

312
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,610
I thought there would be a crowd of people at first.

313
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,290
But the atmosphere is really suitable for composing songs.

314
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,460
I'm quite disappointed.

315
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,860
Why are you disappointed?

316
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,250
Just visit here again next time.

317
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,660
And you can stay at my house.

318
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,610
I have no problems with it.

319
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,730
Really?

320
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,830
Yeah.

321
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,220
You can't change your words.

322
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,440
Yeah.

323
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,170
Just come.

324
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,210
Uh.

325
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,670
Why don't you guys try writing songs in Japanese?

326
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,740
I think you and Plai suit the song well.

327
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,570
Us?

328
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,360
Yeah.

329
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,320
But I don't know about Japanese.

330
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,470
Gosh... Who am I?

331
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,870
I'm P.

332
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,810
You can ask me.

333
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,770
Are your fees expensive?

334
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,080
What do you mean expensive?

335
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,280
Just buy me a beer.

336
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,500
I can't believe it.

337
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,110
Then you could use the song 'Miss You' or something.

338
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,260
Wow, you always carry a composition notebook with you?

339
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,030
So, let's choose this part.

340
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,670
How does it sing?

341
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,580
♫ You just came into my life and left ♫

342
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,670
♫ You left a heart story ♫

343
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,850
♫ I can't forget it ♫

344
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,070
Uh...

345
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,290
Mo...

346
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,070
Yeah. Write it down.

347
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,140
Mo and what?

348
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,510
What's next?

349
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,660
Yeah.

350
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,940
Okay.

351
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,480
Yeah.

352
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,930
This one.

353
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,140
It's not.

354
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,000
Hey, Beboy!

355
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,090
♫ I just need time to forget it ♫

356
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,700
♫ But don't be longer than this ♫

357
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,060
♫ Just being able to let go for a minute, ♫

358
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,960
♫ I'm pleased ♫

359
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,130
The weather is so nice.

360
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,970
Please take a photo for me!

361
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,550
Sure!

362
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,610
Ready...

363
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,450
So handsome.

364
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:10,950
Wow.

365
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,540
This side of you is good.

366
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,590
Okay.

367
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,730
Good.

368
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,140
Let me check the pictures.

369
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,670
How was it?

370
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,890
Wow!

371
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,080
The view is very beautiful!

372
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,200
P!

373
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,540
What?

374
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,970
Where is this place?

375
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,150
The photos came out great!

376
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,990
Look at this!

377
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,640
Yeah.

378
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,270
This is Ueno Park.

379
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:42,360
Did you know that there are a lot of people here at the end of March - the beginning of April?

380
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,690
Why?

381
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,820
It's the cherry blossom season.

382
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,460
Wow!

383
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,210
If I knew it, I would come here that season.

384
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,800
Why did you come at that time?

385
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,310
Do you know? If you come here during that time,
you won't get good photos like this.

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,310
Because there are a lot of people.

387
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,410
Aside from the crowds,
there was also a flea market, many shops and snack shops.

388
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,560
And most importantly, did you know?

389
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,250
It has about a thousand lanterns lit at night.

390
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,860
Wow...

391
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,350
It must be very bright and romantic. P!

392
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,440
I've wanted that picture for a long time.

393
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,890
I dream of it.
If I take a photo like that, I'll upload it to Facebook!

394
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,630
I'll show it off to everyone.

395
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,340
P...

396
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,880
P!

397
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,400
P...

398
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,270
Please wait for me.

399
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,340
I'm so tired.

400
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,060
I have never walked so much in my life.

401
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,710
Is it too much?

402
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,240
It's only once in a while.

403
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,240
Aren't you tired, Pan?

404
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,860
No.

405
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,270
I enjoy watching birds and trees.

406
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,440
Hey, Plai.

407
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,420
There are 3-4 days left.

408
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,000
Are you complaining that you're tired right now?

409
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,910
Looks like someone will be staying at home tomorrow, P.

410
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,600
No.

411
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,570
I can be as strong the next day if I rest.

412
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,240
I'll keep an eye on you.

413
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,660
Let me taste some.

414
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,820
I want one.

415
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,750
It would be nice if it was a clover.

416
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,520
Clover?

417
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,450
It's hard to find.

418
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,020
They say that if anyone finds a four-petals clover,

419
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,860
they will have good luck.

420
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,860
I want to be as lucky as them.

421
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,580
How?

422
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,510
They believe that clover is a leaf of good luck.

423
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,280
Normally, a clover leaf has only three petals.

424
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,870
Ten thousand clovers will only have one four-petals.

425
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,120
Whoever gets it, they are the very lucky ones.

426
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,690
Does it have leaves like that?

427
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,670
Of course.

428
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,320
Did you know that there is a meaning hidden in each petal?

429
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,740
Meaning?

430
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,060
What meaning?

431
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,260
Beboy.

432
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,800
The first petal means trust and faith.

433
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,660
The second petal means good luck.

434
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,540
The third petal means hope.

435
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,860
And the fourth,

436
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,860
last petal

437
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,280
means love.

438
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,510
Uh.

439
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,370
Do you think that if you compare clover petals to us,

440
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,030
which clover are we?

441
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,390
I think my petal is the second petal.

442
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,590
Lucky.

443
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,660
Because I'm lucky to have P as a friend

444
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,590
and traveled to Japan.

445
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,480
The highest jackpot is that

446
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,030
I have you guys as friends.

447
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,160
What about you, Pan?

448
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:04,990
Me?

449
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,390
I'm probably like the third petal, hope.

450
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,050
Because I always hope that I will be a famous singer.

451
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,550
So that I can become a famous artist like other people.

452
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,160
What about you?

453
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,630
Of course, mine is the first petal.

454
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,430
Because I don't have a dream.

455
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,790
I only have my own trust and faith.

456
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,950
Then, there's only me left.

457
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,290
Of course.

458
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,670
It must be a petal about love.

459
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,620
I've just been heartbroken.

460
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,310
What can I do?

461
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,100
Hey.

462
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,940
Why do you have to make it sad?

463
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,670
When you're heartbroken, you should eat delicious food.

464
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,640
And drink some beer too.

465
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,700
Yeah.

466
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,350
Then I'll drink sake until my body breaks down.

467
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,330
What about my beer?

468
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,030
I don't like it.

469
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,070
Hey.

470
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,590
What are you waiting for?

471
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,730
Let's go!

472
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,580
Go!

473
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,080
Let's drink!

474
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,060
- Hey, what are you waiting for?
- Where are you going?

475
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,370
- Hey, my phone.
- Let's drink beer!

476
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,520
Hey, let's cheers!

477
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,430
But I prefer sake.

478
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,540
Go!

479
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,840
No one is waiting for me?

480
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,220
Wait for me!

481
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,659
(Takkanmari University)

482
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
(Drinker)

483
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,450
Wow.

484
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,660
It takes a long time until it is cooked.

485
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,310
Shall we do this?

486
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,670
Shall we play a game while we wait?

487
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,480
What game?

488
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,440
I don't play it if it's a witty problem game.

489
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,970
I'm not very smart.

490
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,190
It's not that kind of game.

491
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,410
But... will you guys play?

492
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,590
Alright, please play it.

493
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,470
Just playing it for fun.

494
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:07,960
Okay?

495
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,990
No one responded.

496
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,060
None of you responded.

497
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,640
It means you guys agree.

498
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,630
So I'll start it.

499
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,360
Hey.

500
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,440
You spend time with Beboy every day,

501
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,700
have you absorbed that personality from him?

502
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,560
Your personality is more like him every day.

503
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,740
Yeah, I think so.

504
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,690
I didn't do anything to him.

505
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,230
That's his personality.

506
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,430
You guys are crazy.

507
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,350
It's not like that.

508
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,460
Well, don't change the topic.

509
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,640
And the game I'm asking you to play...

510
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,280
Umm.

511
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,590
Is called...

512
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,070
Tell the Truth Game.

513
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,830
How is it?

514
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,410
I'm about to explain.

515
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,380
Do you guys see this spoon?

516
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,120
If you spin the spoon and the head of the spoon stops on someone,

517
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,730
that person must be telling the truth.

518
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,150
That's it.

519
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,120
I'll be the one to start.

520
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,390
Hold on!

521
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,600
Is it too big?

522
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,590
It's cluttered. Just this size is enough.

523
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,590
Well, okay.

524
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,860
Put this one away.

525
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,090
Beboy.

526
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,840
Please confess the truth.

527
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,840
Me?

528
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,840
Then...

529
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,910
I would like to confess that

530
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,400
since I was young and growing up,

531
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,820
it was my first time traveling abroad.

532
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,870
It's this time.

533
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm so excited.

534
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,640
But at the same time, I feel afraid.

535
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,630
But I can get through it!

536
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,600
Well, you're great.

537
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,820
So fun.

538
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,020
That's all?

539
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,890
Yes.

540
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,490
Nothing after that?

541
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:52,970
Yes.

542
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,160
Please spin it.

543
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,010
Me?

544
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,790
Ready... 1, 2, 3 go!

545
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,460
Hey!

546
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,670
P!

547
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,480
It's you.

548
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,890
Please confess it, dude.

549
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,140
Me?

550
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,030
I think... I'm like a homeless person.

551
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,900
I do not have a place to stay for a long time.

552
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,700
When night falls, I sleep where I belong.

553
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,850
And live life slowly each day.

554
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,570
Most importantly, I'm a person who has no dreams.

555
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,510
And I have no idea of having it.

556
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,340
Umm.

557
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,110
Umm.

558
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:36,360
Hey!

559
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,590
Me again?

560
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,270
Yeah!

561
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,930
Damn. It turned towards me exactly.

562
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,180
What do you want me to confess?

563
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,400
It's nothing!

564
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,470
Alright, let's do this.

565
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,770
So I'll ask you.

566
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,900
Okay.

567
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,150
Beboy.

568
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,150
Yeah.

569
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,560
Since you were born,

570
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,690
how many people have you had sex with?

571
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,430
Me?

572
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,170
I'll tell you.

573
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,180
I've had sex with...

574
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:18,990
0 people.

575
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,810
Why?

576
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,230
It's a waste of my time.

577
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,740
Spin it!

578
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,390
Me?

579
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,090
Yeah.

580
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,850
Plai!

581
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:35,960
Me?

582
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,230
Then...

583
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,960
I'll tell you what you guys want to know.

584
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,250
The reason I came to Japan was that

585
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,130
I was terribly heartbroken.

586
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,470
I had high expectations

587
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,410
for that love.

588
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,980
After it's over...

589
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,790
So it hurts me.

590
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,430
So I thought I'd go extreme for this trip.

591
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,570
In case I can forget all my old memories.

592
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,680
Spin it!

593
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,020
Spin it.

594
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,820
- Really?
- Spin it.

595
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,540
- Okay.
- Yeah.

596
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,430
Hey!

597
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,360
You don't need to spin it.

598
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,470
You are the last one.

599
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,750
Huh?

600
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,710
Please confess the truth.

601
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,340
Don't you let him spin first?

602
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,160
Hurry up!

603
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,200
Me, right?

604
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,540
It's true that I am the older brother.

605
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,990
But do you know?

606
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,050
I have always been an older brother who followed behind my younger brother.

607
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,760
Because I'm not as talented and confident as him.

608
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,820
I admit that...

609
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,330
there were times when I was envious of him.

610
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,600
It makes me want to be a famous singer.

611
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,860
In case my family knows that I can be successful on my own.

612
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,770
Hey!

613
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,869
The meat is burnt!

614
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,120
Don't you guys eat it?

615
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,110
Pick it up!

616
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,360
Do you have it?

617
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,550
Take it.

618
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,750
Take out the burnt meat first.

619
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,550
Here!

620
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,810
Come on!

621
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,950
Let's just say it's a celebration of you being my friend.

622
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,590
I ask you to pick up a piece of chicken each

623
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,170
and cheers with me.

624
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,710
Other people cheers with alcohol,

625
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,690
but I cheers with chicken.

626
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,570
Because I prefer snacks.

627
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,180
Cheers!

628
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,180
Come on. Cheers!

629
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,600
It's delicious.

630
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,510
We cheers with chicken, we should cheers with beer too.

631
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,160
Well, come on.

632
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,820
Let's cheers.

633
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,730
Cheers!

634
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,840
Beboy, walk carefully.

635
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,280
Well, go.

636
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,500
Stand carefully.

637
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,700
P.

638
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,520
Yeah.

639
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,360
I give up on you guys.

640
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,500
You drink it at a restaurant and bring it home to drink.

641
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,240
I give up.

642
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,330
I really want to give up.

643
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,050
It's only been a while.

644
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,430
Why do you have to complain?

645
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,020
Open the door.

646
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,300
Go! Open the door.

647
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,210
Please hold it.

648
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,710
Go.

649
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,130
Walk carefully, Beboy.

650
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,130
Bring me here to sit.

651
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,230
I can't stand it.

652
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,830
Ready?

653
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,190
Come on.

654
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,690
Yeah.

655
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,620
Go!

656
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,770
Hey!

657
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,160
That's a card, not mince pork.
(Pronounced like shuffling cards)

658
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,540
Damn.

659
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,229
You're a funny person.

660
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,799
I shuffle cards, not mince pork.

661
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,100
Well, shuffle the cards.

662
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,170
Go!

663
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,850
I got a king card.

664
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,090
Well.

665
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,980
People who got two spades

666
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,580
and

667
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,480
three spades,

668
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,910
licked each other's ears once!

669
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,089
Damn, I got three spades.

670
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm ace.

671
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,160
I'm two.

672
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,060
Why is it you!?

673
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,940
Damn!

674
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,760
Why is it me?

675
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,740
Fully.

676
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:24,830
I want people who have two spades take off all his shirts except his boxers!

677
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,439
Let's go!

678
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,300
Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!

679
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,300
I got a king card!

680
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:51,740
I would like to instruct the person who got the Ace of Spades and Two of Spades

681
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,779
to use their tongues to lick each other's nipples 5 times.

682
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,570
Go!

683
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,480
Go!

684
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,520
I got the king card again!

685
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,560
I order the people who have the Ace of Spades and the Three of Spades

686
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,880
to kiss each other and use their tongues.

687
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,440
Damn.

688
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,250
Hey.

689
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,340
Hey.

690
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,110
Hey.

691
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,110
Are you guys too happy?

692
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,030
Huh?

693
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,240
Alright, let's continue.

694
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,320
You guys are kissing like this, do you guys want to go to your room?

695
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,700
P!

696
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,960
I can't stand it anymore.

697
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,730
May I go to bed first?

698
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,920
Well, okay.

699
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,750
Are you okay?

700
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,580
So fine, dude.

701
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,480
I'm always okay.

702
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,690
Hey.

703
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,900
Are you okay, Beboy?

704
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,320
I'll take him to the room.

705
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,900
Well, take good care of him.

706
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,610
Please take care of him.

707
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,150
Hey, take that card off of him first.

708
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,620
Yeah.

709
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,660
Stand carefully, Beboy.

710
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,540
Are you okay?

711
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,310
Do you want to continue drinking with me?

712
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,080
Open it.

713
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,020
What are you waiting for?

714
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,450
1, 2, 3. Go!

715
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,400
Cheers!

716
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,380
Are you okay, Beboy?

717
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,750
Beboy.

718
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,250
Sleep on the pillow.

719
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,640
Beboy.

720
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,850
When you say you've never kissed anyone,

721
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,120
are you telling the truth?

722
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:56,670
Yes.

723
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,200
Do you want me to teach you?

724
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,120
Can you?

725
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:15,920
Sure.

726
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,750
First,

727
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,340
just let the emotions flow.

728
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,240
Don't tense up.

729
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,150
Flow naturally.

730
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,430
Let's cheers.

731
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

732
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:49,440
There's nothing to do.

733
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,410
I'm going to pick up my guitar.

734
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,820
Yeah.

735
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,810
Do you want to listen to any songs?

736
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,450
I'll play it for you.

737
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,430
It seems like the guitar is your life.

738
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,030
Absolutely.

739
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,780
It's probably because I think it's the only thing I can do better than Plai.

740
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,750
Really?

741
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,220
Just kidding.

742
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,320
Not that much.

743
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,850
It's good to have a guitar as a friend.

744
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,850
If you are uncomfortable,

745
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,000
the sound of the guitar will make you feel better.

746
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,280
You love guitars, does that mean you have many guitars?

747
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,100
I have only three guitars.

748
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,590
I love this guitar the most.

749
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,750
We go together everywhere

750
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,610
But now it has become my work equipment.

751
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,750
And you? Do you like playing music?

752
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,880
No.

753
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,270
I can't play any musical instruments.

754
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,830
I even sang in the wrong key.

755
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,280
Also, I don't dance in rhythm.

756
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,750
How do I play music?

757
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,780
I can't do it.

758
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,560
You're better at listening, right?

759
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,030
Yeah.

760
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,100
What kind of music do you usually play?

761
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,940
Actually, I can do any genre.

762
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,190
Depends on the request.

763
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,260
Do you want to request me?

764
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,100
Uh.

765
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,370
How long will you live like this?

766
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,310
I don't know.

767
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,270
All I know is that right now I like here.

768
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,760
I'll be here for a while.

769
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,320
Your lifestyle looks fun.

770
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,650
There are good and bad things mixed together.

771
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,550
The good thing would be to live independently.

772
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,570
I can go and do the things I want to do.

773
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,260
I don't need to care about anyone.

774
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:59,140
The bad thing is probably living life in a carefree and unstable way.

775
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,360
Can't be relied on by anyone.

776
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,510
But I'm used to it.

777
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,510
Uh, P.

778
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,460
Yeah.

779
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,280
I think you can play guitar.

780
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,190
Really?

781
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,750
Of course.

782
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,490
Do you want to try it? I will teach you.

783
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:19,730
Yeah.

784
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,980
I'll try it.

785
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,570
Well.

786
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,460
First of all, hold it like this.

787
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,300
And you have to...

788
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:29,890
Hold on.

789
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:31,520
It's like I've seen you play it.

790
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,340
Well.

791
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,310
I have to hold it like this, right?

792
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,040
Just roughly.

793
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:35,630
Yeah.

794
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,580
Put this finger here.

795
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,070
Put this finger here.

796
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,180
What's next?

797
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,900
What chords next?

798
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,290
I can't remember it.

799
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,560
Hey, you.

800
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,200
Can you teach 'Miss U' to me?

801
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,550
Miss U?

802
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,190
Yeah.

803
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,340
I know

804
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,250
that you are lusting.

805
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,430
Since you play the game.
