Damn!

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,400
- P. - Yeah.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
This bag is leaking.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,410
Let me go fill up the water first.

9
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,410
And this one, right?

10
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,420
Yes.

11
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,210
No. It's mine.

12
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
What's wrong with Pan?

13
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,250
Let me go grab a glass first.

14
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,350
I don't know.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,950
He's acting weird.

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Two of you...

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Hey!

18
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,550
Can you guys stop walking?

19
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,900
Beboy and I bought you guys breakfast.

20
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,370
Eat it first and we'll go out later.

21
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Yes!

22
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,150
We have to EAT TOGETHER first.

23
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,430
What's wrong with them?

24
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,660
Hey!

25
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,220
Eat at this table!

26
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Go.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,450
You too.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Hey.

29
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,690
I feel awkward.

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,440
Why do you all have to be quiet?

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,270
Follow me after you finish eating.

32
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,450
I will wait for you in front of the house.

33
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,880
Let's go. I'm ready.

34
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,800
I don't have any plans to take you guys anywhere this morning.

35
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,130
I think you guys are still hungover.

36
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,430
In the end, you all woke up very quickly.

37
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,500
I don't sleep well.

38
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,490
Yes.

39
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,800
It seemed because the sleeping place was unfamiliar.

40
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,740
Me too.

41
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,170
So I'm taking you guys to Tokyo Tower today.

42
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,070
Does anyone else want to go to another place today?

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
I'll take you there.

44
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,490
Me!

45
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,500
I want to go to a delicious restaurant.

46
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
Please take me there.

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Anywhere is okay.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,780
Sure.

49
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,910
So let's find something to eat and chill.

50
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,120
Hey. I want to go to another place.

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Onsen!

52
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,160
I want to go to the onsen once in my life.

53
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,770
Please take me there.

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Anywhere is okay.

55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,070
Please?

56
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,520
Onsen...

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Sure.

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,290
But I suggest you go there in the evening

59
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,210
or late at night.

60
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,330
Because it feels better.

61
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
- Let's go. - Hey!

62
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,240
Let me go get my guitar first. I also have to film content.

63
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Hurry up.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Let's go.

65
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,210
Wow!

66
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,770
P!

67
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,250
Japanese people make cute bread, right?

68
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,510
Yeah. I don't know where I should bite.

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm afraid it will be ugly.

70
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,839
Oh, the fish swam out.

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,320
- Swam out. - Swam out.

72
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,600
- The fish swam out. - Let me see.

73
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,520
Look at this.

74
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,029
Here.

75
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,160
Oh.

76
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,130
You ate it too!?

78
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,880
P!

79
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,900
You broke my heart!

80
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,450
Gosh, Beboy.

81
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Why do you have to be picky?

82
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,890
It will be in your stomach anyway.

83
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,200
Gosh... P...

84
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,580
Well, just eat them all.

85
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,590
Well, eat them.

86
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,030
Is it hot?

87
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Yes.

88
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,620
Gosh... P.

89
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,170
I haven't taken a picture of it yet.

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I ate it first.

91
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,790
What flavor is this?

92
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,360
Tasty.

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Uh...

94
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,590
Where do we go after here?

95
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,310
I haven't thought about it yet.

96
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,210
Please give me a moment.

97
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,030
Hey, Beboy.

98
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
What's wrong with you?

99
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,330
Your mouth will swell.

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,150
My hands are shaking.

101
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,510
I want to take pictures.

102
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,420
Please blow it for me.

103
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,589
Before your hand shakes, your hand will swell.

104
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,120
Yeah.

105
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,620
It's very hot. I'm too rush.

106
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,910
- Let's go! - Shall we go now?

107
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Let's go.

108
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,370
Here.

109
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,580
A place I want to take you all to visit.

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,040
Tokyo Tower.

111
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,330
Wow!

112
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,540
So beautiful, P!

113
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,380
Normally, I've seen it on the internet.

114
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,840
It was the first time I had ever actually seen Tokyo Tower.

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
So beautiful.

116
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,850
Yeah.

117
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,810
It really is like the Eiffel Tower in France.

118
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,480
Do you think so?

119
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,690
Yeah.

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,430
But here it is about 10 meters higher than there.

121
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:34,990
10 meters higher?

122
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,990
Yeah.

123
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,529
10 meters you mean...

124
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,040
How high is this?

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,460
About 332.974321 meters.

126
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Why do you remember it so accurately?

127
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,620
I just checked on Google.

128
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
It really wastes my time.

129
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,850
So beautiful.

130
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Uh.

131
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,039
But look at its structure.

132
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,070
It's really modern.

133
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,800
The architect who designed it was amazing.

134
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,330
Even after 10 years, it is still modern and durable.

135
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:10,490
Just now, I heard a tour guide tell tourists that this is a symbol of Japan's prosperity.

136
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,170
Yes.

137
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,980
Moreover, it's also a symbol of hope.

138
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,760
Overcoming the cruelty and hardship of the Japanese people.

139
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,440
Did you check Google again this time?

140
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Just now.

141
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,000
But how many people visit here in a year, P?

142
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,599
You ask how many in a year?

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,629
Yes, in a year.

144
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,039
Just a moment. Let me find the information first.

145
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,439
I just want to know it.

146
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
About 2 million people.

147
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,810
Wow!

148
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,140
So this year, we will be 4 out of 2 million people, right?

149
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Yeah.

150
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,180
You can, but you have to get up there first now.

151
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Hurry up. Before the evening comes.

152
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Let's go.

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Let's go.

154
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,210
I think it's has disappeared.

155
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,220
I told you, it's still in the same place.

156
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,120
There is a low percentage of lost items in Japan.

157
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Well.

158
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,750
I'm tired.

159
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,260
Let's go.

160
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,110
We'll be late.

161
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,210
- Hurry up. - Hold on.

162
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,350
Anyway, we ran back to the same place.

163
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,980
The view behind where we used to stand was very beautiful.

164
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,870
Tokyo Tower is very beautiful.

165
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,470
Shall we shoot a cover video and sing a song?

166
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,670
Filming here is okay.

167
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Uh, Beboy.

168
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,800
Can you take a video for me?

169
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,770
I forgot to bring a tripod.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Me?

171
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,380
May I buy some water first?

172
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,520
I'll come back and take it for you later.

173
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,020
Please take it for me.

174
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,330
Please?

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,250
Well, stop arguing.

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll buy it for you.

177
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,780
Please do it for me.

178
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,810
Well.

179
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,930
Let's go.

180
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,290
What about your phone?

181
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,940
Right there.

182
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
And what about your phone?

183
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,760
Send it to me. I'll take it for you.

184
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Wow.

185
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,930
Right here.

186
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,610
The view is very beautiful.

187
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,520
Here.

188
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,130
Beboy, please take it and...

189
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,720
show the whole view.

190
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,300
The whole?

191
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,830
Does it show?

192
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,220
Can you do it?

193
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,740
Okay.

194
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:12,900
Please take test pictures for me.

195
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,990
Let me see.

196
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
It's okay.

197
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Here.

198
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,270
Please give me some time to set up the guitar.

199
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,310
Wow!

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,330
Of course, it's my skill.

201
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,160
So beautiful!

202
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,460
Plai, please help me hold it.

203
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,830
Stand there, Beboy.

204
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I'm ready.

205
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,820
- Hold on. I'm... - Okay, I'm ready.

206
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,930
Has it come out well yet?

207
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,040
Yes. Hurry up!

208
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,380
It's about to get dark.

209
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,250
Ready? Start!

210
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:47,902
( The old love is still deeply etched in my heart )

211
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:51,822
( Every word is still the same as in the past )

212
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,591
( I know it hurts, but why doesn't it end? )

213
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:58,871
(It's painful every time)

214
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:03,439
(I just need time to forget it)

215
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
(But don't be longer than this)

216
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:10,853
(Just being able to let go for a minute, )

217
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:14,977
(I'm pleased)

218
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:21,057
(Just being able to let go for a minute, )

219
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:27,342
(I'm pleased)

220
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,470
Please say hello to the camera!

221
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,619
Thank you so much.

222
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,910
- Pan, Plai! - Thank you.

223
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,789
There are a lot of people watching you!

224
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,560
Really?

225
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
There are only compliments to you.

226
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,410
They said the two of you sang and played well.

227
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,729
Hey!

228
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,760
You guys are famous!

229
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,379
Thank you. Thank you so much.

230
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,220
Hey, don't forget me. You're already famous.

231
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,190
Yeah.

232
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,530
Thank you, Beboy.

233
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,460
It's okay.

234
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,800
Let me re-watch it.

235
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Okay.

236
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,870
- Wow! - Hey!

237
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
How was it?

238
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,590
Too beautiful.

239
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,590
It's my skill.

240
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
So good.

241
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,230
Am I awesome?

242
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,200
Thank you.

243
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,330
It's okay.

244
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,210
I can say that if I posted it on YouTube, it would get more than a million views.

245
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,489
Wow, a million views?

246
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,490
Yeah.

247
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,289
The video came out very well.

248
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,880
So beautiful.

249
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,560
Is it good?

250
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,100
Did I do well?

251
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm here. Sorry.

252
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,550
Finally you have arrived.

253
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,840
The concert has already ended.

254
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,740
Yeah.

255
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,120
Do you want me to wait for this water until the next life?

256
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,340
Well, I'm sorry.

257
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,340
Here, your peach tea.

258
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,130
Thank you.

259
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Hey.

260
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,710
How did you know that Pan liked it?

261
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,970
Well, I just know it.

262
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,870
Is it right?

263
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,860
Well, hurry up. I'm hungry.

264
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,380
What are you waiting for? Hurry and walk.

265
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,720
P!

266
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,410
Yeah.

267
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,870
What did you bring me to eat?

268
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,680
This is oden.

269
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,840
It's only sold in winter, in Japan.

270
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,660
It's very delicious, taste it.

271
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,050
Uh.

272
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,860
I was going to tell you guys earlier.

273
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,920
But you, Beboy, you interrupted me.

274
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,640
This time is during the Halloween season.

275
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,109
There is a 'Shibuya Halloween Party' held in Shibuya.

276
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,110
Yeah.

277
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,220
But it seems I've heard that they won't be holding the party this year.

278
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,030
I've heard that there's a parade, right?

279
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,530
Yes.

280
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,340
The parade you mentioned, you saw it on the internet, right?

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,840
Beboy, you saw it today too.

282
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,930
They wore Mario costumes and drove small cars on the road.

283
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,110
That's the parade.

284
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,390
Oh.

285
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,510
I love it.

286
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,840
I've seen it.

287
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Unfortunately, I don't know if they will hold a party.

288
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,660
So I thought I'd take you guys to many places like Shinjuku and Harajuku first.

289
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,140
Do you guys want to go there?

290
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Good.

291
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,250
Anyway, we're outside.

292
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,700
So that we don't waste time our trip.

293
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,440
Pan, Beboy.

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,230
You guys still have the strength to walk, right?

295
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm so chill.

296
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,590
Me too.

297
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,800
But we didn't wear costumes today.

298
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,710
Will it be okay?

299
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,350
Hey, don't worry about it.

300
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,720
I prepared it.

301
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,560
I know we traveled during Halloween.

302
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,900
I prepared it for filming content.

303
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,280
You prepared well.

304
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,970
Well, let's eat it quickly.

305
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,180
Let's go home and get dressed and hurry out.

306
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,809
The later the night, the bigger the crowd.

307
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,810
Yes, hurry up.

308
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm okay with everything.

309
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,400
But don't forget my promise.

310
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,400
What promise?

311
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,070
Huh?

312
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,070
The promise you made was that you would take me to the onsen.

313
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,310
Have you forgotten it?

314
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,480
Oh.

315
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Well.

316
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,250
Do we still have time left?

317
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
We can.

318
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,460
But I think we should hurry and eat it.

319
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
And hurried to change costumes.

320
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I'm getting cold now.

321
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,540
Well, let's eat it all quickly.

322
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,100
Okay.

323
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Then, let's go there.

324
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
But...

325
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,150
There's nothing we've forgotten, right?

326
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:19,880
Nothing.

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,650
There's only one thing, we forgot to eat it. Hurry up.

328
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,530
I would like to see the onsen once in my life.

329
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,810
Finally, I can see the real place.

330
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:28,810
Do you want it?

331
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,660
I'm full, thank you.

332
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,050
Hey, we've arrived. It's here.

333
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,330
Wow!

334
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,510
Is it really this big?

335
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah.

336
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,170
Wait for me.

337
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,909
- Hurry up! - Okay.

338
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,910
I've just been here for the first time.

339
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,630
Oh, it looks relaxing.

340
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,950
Let's go.

341
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,280
Hey, guys.

342
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,189
Let's wait about 15 minutes first.

343
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,190
And go inside later.

344
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,580
Why do we have to wait so long?

345
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,580
Can't we just go in?

346
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,890
You can't.

347
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,920
We just finished eating.

348
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,580
Do not soak in water right after eating.

349
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,730
It should be 30-60 minutes after eating.

350
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,340
It took us 20 minutes to get here.

351
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,310
Just waited about 10 minutes, it was just in time.

352
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,240
Uh.

353
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,230
It seems like I've read it on the internet.

354
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,070
Japanese people call public baths like this 'sento'.

355
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,880
Yes.

356
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,350
But if it's a real natural hot spring, it's called a ryokan.

357
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,650
Correct.

358
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,230
Uh.

359
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,280
If we want to go to a real hot spring, where do we go?

360
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,050
We have to go to other provinces.

361
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,680
It has many places.

362
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,600
I'll take you there if you come here again.

363
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,180
Well, come on.

364
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Let's take a photo.

365
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:07,924
Where?

366
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:08,840
Right here.

367
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,440
Well.

368
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
Come on.

369
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,200
One...

370
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,160
Please take nice pictures.

371
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Yeah.

372
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,040
One, two...

373
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,769
- Just one picture. - Do we take photos from this side too?

374
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,839
No, just one picture is enough.

375
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,860
One more picture, please.

376
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,020
This way.

377
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,250
Guys.

378
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,070
One, two, three.

379
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Well, that's enough.

380
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,600
I saw a gachapon machine over there.

381
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,630
May I go play it?

382
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,630
Hey, your eyesight is really nimble.

383
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,490
- Please? - Can I go with you?

384
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,110
Let's go!

385
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,260
It's good. While we wait.

386
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Aren't you inviting me?

387
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,560
You don't play it, anyway.

388
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,030
Let's go.

389
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,370
Yeah.

390
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:50,870
Beboy, why don't you take a water bottle?

391
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,670
You forgot your things.

392
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Come on, guys.

393
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,080
Wow, that's huge.

394
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,590
Good.

395
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,800
Come on, let's choose a locker.

396
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,380
You chose this one?

397
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Yeah.

398
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Which one should I choose?

399
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,310
P!

400
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,510
Yeah.

401
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,020
I have never seen a place like this before.

402
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,570
Yeah.

403
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
P!

404
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,610
Yeah.

405
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,920
Let's take a photo!

406
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,200
Hey, Beboy!

407
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,930
Are you crazy?

408
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,500
Who takes photos in a place like this?

409
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,230
Why?

410
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,140
There's a rule about not taking pictures here, don't you know?

411
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,390
It has a sign on it.

412
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,550
They don't allow using phones and don't take photos.

413
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,870
I can't read it.

414
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,600
Even if you can't read it, you shouldn't do it.

415
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,390
Well, I won't take pictures.

416
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,570
Alright, Beboy.

417
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,820
It wouldn't matter if you didn't just take pictures of just one place.

418
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,480
There are many beautiful places for you to take photos.

419
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,140
Don't worry.

420
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Fine.

421
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,809
Put your phones in here.

422
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,920
Don't forget to turn off your phone.

423
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,750
After we finish, we'll come back and pick up the things later.

424
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
P.

425
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,400
It definitely won't disappear, right?

426
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,620
Beboy.

427
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,970
Please look carefully, every locker has a key.

428
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,250
Another thing, Pan forgot his guitar at the park but it didn't even disappear.

429
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,710
Yeah.

430
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,080
Don't worry.

431
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,720
Well, it's true.

432
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,860
I forgot.

433
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
Hey!

434
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,380
What the hell are you guys doing!?

435
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,860
My eyes are going blind!

436
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,010
What's wrong with you, Beboy?

437
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,140
Don't tell me, you'll...

438
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,370
Hey.

439
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,790
Beboy.

440
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,020
Don't you take your shirt off when you shower?

441
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,660
I do!

442
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,970
But...

443
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,150
Usually, I live alone.

444
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,350
We are here with many people.

445
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,710
Hey, you want to come to the onsen.

446
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,520
Haven't you ever checked the rules before?

447
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I'm just embarrassed.

448
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,760
I can't have one piece left?

449
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,520
Like this towel.

450
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
You can't.

451
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,110
Only this one?

452
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,350
Yeah.

453
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
What?

454
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,000
How could I hide it all with such a small towel?

455
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,710
Hey.

456
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,210
Hey.

457
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Hey.

458
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Hey.

459
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,270
Hey.

460
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,290
It's good that we're here during this time. It has few people.

461
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Yeah.

462
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,520
It's like we're rich.

463
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,540
It's like reserving a private onsen.

464
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,840
But normally, there are a lot of people.

465
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,530
I think they were all at Halloween party.

466
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,370
Hey!

467
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,920
You guys haven't gone into the hot springs yet?

468
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,700
Why are there so many steps?

469
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,280
How much embarrassment will you let me?

470
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,280
Beboy.

471
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
You need to take a warm shower to acclimate your body to the temperature.

472
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,780
Yes.

473
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,610
You must shower thoroughly.

474
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,870
Don't shower roughly.

475
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,720
What about my hair?

476
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,380
Can I not wash my hair?

477
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,110
I'm very deliberate about styling my hair.

478
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
You must wash your hair.

479
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Hey.

480
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Oh.

481
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,580
I'm sorry.

482
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,350
I think I'm here alone.

483
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,410
That's okay.

484
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,160
Wow.

485
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,130
You brought a lot to Japan.

486
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,800
You are not causing the Thai people to lose their reputation.

487
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,800
Thank you.

488
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,830
But it's not that much.

489
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,770
Yeah.

490
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,840
My father gave me this DNA.

491
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,690
Just 56.

492
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,720
But...

493
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,650
Y... yes?

494
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:11,830
Why did you bring so little?

495
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Wow!

496
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,390
So grand!

497
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,010
Have you gained confidence now?

498
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,250
Huh?

499
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Sure.

500
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,300
It's more grand than I thought.

501
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,200
Hey.

502
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,740
Now you are grand in front of us as well.

503
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,200
I think we mean different things.

504
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,880
Come down here.

505
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
You're really slow.

506
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,520
Otherwise, we won't wait for you.

507
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,970
Hurry up, come down.

508
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,890
It's relaxing.

509
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,690
It's good.

510
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,480
I want to stay here all day and all night, P.

511
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,070
You can't.

512
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,970
Are you crazy? Beboy.

513
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,590
You will die from fainting.

514
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,860
I'm not calling an ambulance for you.

515
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Why?

516
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,180
I think we can stay here like a swimming pool.

517
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I'm happy.

518
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,390
Beboy.

519
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,370
Do you believe in miracles?

520
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,440
I believe it half and I don't believe it half, Pan.

521
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Why?

522
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,640
Hey, let's go to another tub.

523
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,400
Beboy, hurry up.

524
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,630
Right here.

525
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,700
You're slow. Your friends won't wait for you.

526
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,200
Guys.

527
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:07,850
Huh?

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm really asking you guys.

529
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
Are we really going to walk around in this outfit?

530
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,540
Why are you shy?

531
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
It's cute.

532
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,790
Yeah.

533
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,690
Yeah.

534
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,200
Show it, friend.

535
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,410
It's a strange thing.

536
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,780
Strange things from Thailand.

537
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,410
Hey.

538
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,750
We're at a ghost release party, we should release it fully.

539
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,480
This party!

540
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Ghost sees ghost. (People of the same type and people of the same type)

541
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,030
Hey.

542
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,780
You all dress like everyone else.

543
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,780
But I dress strangely.

544
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,640
It's like I walked out of McDonald's.

545
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Look, P.

546
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,910
There were a lot of people.

547
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,600
No one can beat you.

548
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
So cool, P.

549
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,110
Look.

550
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,110
Everyone dresses up as a ghost.

551
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Well.

552
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,390
May I walk separately with you?

553
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,470
May I walk that way?

554
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,470
Can I walk separately with you?

555
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,870
You really love me.

556
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,320
Hey.

557
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,780
Okay. That's it.

558
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,979
I'll walk that way.

559
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,550
Well.

560
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,590
Well.

561
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,449
We'll meet around here at 11 p.m.

562
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,730
Umm.

563
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:15,620
Or in front of the train station at 11 p.m.

564
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,810
I'll go with Beboy.

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,220
Please take care of him.

There are a lot of people.
