Oh.

3
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,330
You awake now?

4
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,110
Yeah.

5
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,520
Are you still hangover?

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,340
Do you have anything else you would like to say to me?

7
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,810
I'll go get dressed first.

8
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,530
Have you finished packing your luggage?

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,160
Yeah.

10
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,680
Check it carefully to see if you've forgotten anything.

11
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,790
I checked it.

12
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,230
But we have to go back to Thailand.

13
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
I probably have to leave a place of peace

14
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,130
and good atmosphere like this?

15
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,080
Normally, don't you like lights, colors and sounds?

16
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,320
Have you already gotten used to it?

17
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,660
Sometimes...

18
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,110
when we're in a peaceful space

19
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,550
with a good atmosphere like this,

20
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,530
it makes us hear our hearts more clearly, don't you think?

21
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,600
Hey.

22
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,160
Have you finished packing your luggage?

23
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,250
Yeah.

24
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,240
Done.

25
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,900
I'm here.

26
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,920
4 flavors, 4 cups.

27
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,080
Choose it.

28
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,530
Isn't it just hot noodles that can help relieve a hangover?

29
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
Are you out of money?

30
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,470
So you eat noodles.

31
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,320
If you run out of money, you can borrow it from me.

32
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,470
No.

33
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,760
I just thought that we should try it

34
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,620
since we're in the home town of ramen, don't you think?

35
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,300
Look.

36
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,800
It has many flavors for you to choose from.

37
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,420
I can't choose it.

38
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,450
I prefer this flavor.

39
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:24,980
Hey.

40
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,660
You hurry and grab it before anyone else.

41
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,960
Hey!

42
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,660
I have something for you.

43
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,400
Here!

44
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,750
Hey.

45
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,900
This is a clover leaf.

46
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,270
Where did you get it from?

47
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,020
I looked and bought it for you.

48
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,930
Here.

49
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,390
Wow.

50
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,040
You're really dedicated.

51
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,400
You buy it for your friends.

52
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,740
Just think of it as a souvenir from me.

53
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,040
Here, one for each person.

54
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,420
Thank you.

55
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,940
Thank you.

56
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,170
Thank you.

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
I will preserve it well.

58
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,160
From now on all our wishes and miracles

59
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,060
will come true, right?

60
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,280
Let's do this.

61
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,360
To thank fate for bringing the four of us together.

62
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,680
So before you guys go back to Thailand,

63
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
I'll take you to some places.

64
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,800
This place is famous for its blessings.

65
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,280
Many people make wishes here and their wishes come true.

66
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,700
Is it a temple?

67
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,210
Yes.

68
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,730
Is there a temple like this?

69
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,320
Sure.

70
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,880
What about our baggage?

71
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,910
Where will you put it?

72
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,210
Your house?

73
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,460
Wow...

74
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,320
It would be a waste of time if we leave it at home.

75
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,160
Just take it with us.

76
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,230
I think there are lockers nearby for storing things.

77
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,720
We can keep it there before traveling.

78
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,110
We can go back and get it when we finish our trip.

79
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,380
And we went to the airport after that.

80
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,640
Let's do this.

81
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,750
Leave your luggage at my house first.

82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,780
I will call the moving service to the airport later.

83
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,160
I'm okay with it.

84
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,260
Then hurry up and eat all the noodles

85
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,880
and let's go.

86
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,930
Okay?

87
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,710
Okay.

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,550
Right there.

89
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,510
The big red lantern over there.

90
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,760
We've arrived.

91
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,420
Sensoji Temple.

92
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,790
Let's go.

93
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,080
Go.

94
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,200
Hey.

95
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,350
We've arrived.

96
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,100
The front gate of Sensoji Temple.

97
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,810
Wow!

98
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,720
So beautiful!

99
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,050
P.

100
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,270
I saw my Facebook friend

101
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,190
take a photo with this lantern

102
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,940
and set it as their profile picture.

103
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,420
I never thought I would actually see it.

104
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,680
But...

105
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,270
What does this letter mean?

106
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
This letter is pronounced Kaminarimon.

107
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,850
It means lightning gate.

108
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,450
This gate has two angels protecting it.

109
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,530
They are...

110
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,420
On the left is Fujin, the god of the wind.

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,960
To the right is Raijin, the god of thunder.

112
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,220
You really have a lot of information.

113
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,760
Because I learned a bit about it.

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,020
I applaud you. You're really amazing.

115
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,920
Uh.

116
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,110
Since we reached the check-in point,

117
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,520
let's take a group photo?

118
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,660
Hey, I agree with you. Come on.

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,670
Let's take a photo.

120
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,910
Use Beboy's camera.

121
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,010
My camera. Hurry up.

122
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,260
Ready?

123
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,350
P! This way.

124
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,820
Yeah.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
1...

126
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,450
Well.

127
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,570
Did it come out well?

128
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,210
It's so beautiful.

129
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,860
Hey, good.

130
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,800
Let's go.

131
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,730
Let's go. Let's go inside, shall we?

132
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,920
Let's go.

133
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,500
Hey, guys.

134
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,740
The gate we are about to pass is called Hozomon.

135
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,480
Its meaning is a treasury.

136
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,580
Well...

137
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,600
It's really meaningful.

138
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,050
Japanese people recommend that after walking through this gate,

139
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,520
we must predict our fortunes first.

140
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,640
Really?

141
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,490
So what are we waiting for?

142
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,760
Let's go predict our fortunes.

143
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,850
Let's go!

144
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,760
On the left.

145
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,490
Here.

146
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,760
The step is to insert coins.

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,900
Put 100 yen in.

148
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,900
And pick up this one.

149
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,560
We have to shake it like this.

150
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,450
And wait until it's like this.

151
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,770
And check the number we got.

152
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,250
It's bad.

153
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,720
What about me?

154
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,990
Let me see.

155
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,600
Good.

156
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,400
It came out good.

157
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:46,480
Wait. Wait. Wait.

158
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,430
Are my results good?

159
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,820
Please read it for me.

160
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,710
I can't read it.

161
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,590
Your luck is good too.

162
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,200
- My luck is good?
- Yes.

163
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,160
- Is your luck good too?
- Yes.

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,050
Let me see.

165
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,680
Wow.

166
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,850
Pan's fortunes are really good.

167
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,940
Everyone's fortunes are good.

168
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,000
What about you, P?

169
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,260
Not very good.

170
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,160
Is that so?

171
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,010
Uh.

172
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:14,328
Do you know what it's called?

173
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,426
This is Omikuji.

174
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:20,844
It's like a shrine in our country that has siamsi for divination.

175
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:21,911
- Oh.
- Yeah.

176
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:26,471
After we get it, it is called our destiny card or our destiny.

177
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:30,382
If we get a bad one, we have to tie it here.

178
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,211
If we get a good one, just take it back with you.

179
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:33,164
That's all. Nothing much.

180
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,075
Then I have to bring it back.

181
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,168
Let's go.

182
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:37,697
My fortune is bad.

183
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,342
- Tie that.
- Yeah.

184
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:40,213
Let's go.

185
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:53,457
Can you do it?

186
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:55,413
Let's go.

187
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:56,675
It's okay. Let's go.

188
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:01,635
Wow, there's a lot of smoke.

189
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:02,595
P.

190
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:05,048
Can I put incense sticks somewhere else after making a wish?

191
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,880
You can't, Beboy.

192
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,919
Incense smoke is very important.

193
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,608
Why?

194
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:15,164
There is a belief about beckoning good luck smoke to oneself.

195
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:15,766
- Yes.
- Really?

196
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:16,364
Yeah.

197
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:17,244
So I'll do it.

198
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:18,640
Hey, wait wait wait.

199
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:19,964
Calm down.

200
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:23,413
You can't just beckon smoke towards you.

201
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:24,488
How is it?

202
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,895
First of all, you need to buy some incense sticks.

203
00:13:26,896 --> 00:13:28,255
After that, you will be able to pray.

204
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:29,920
After that, you put incense sticks.

205
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:33,315
When you finish putting incense sticks, you can beckon the smoke towards you

206
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:35,022
to bring good things towards you.

207
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:36,631
- And...
- Let's pray, shall we?

208
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:37,893
Where is the incense?

209
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:38,906
Right there.

210
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:39,848
Let's go.

211
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,911
Uh.

212
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:14,453
Some say that beckoning with smoke is taking a smoke bath.

213
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,097
The smoke will cleanse bad things from your body.

214
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,360
Something like that.

215
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,462
I don't know what to say

216
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,173
if I don't succeed when I return to Thailand
after beckoning with smoke like this.

217
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:25,928
Look.

218
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:27,991
You will definitely succeed.

219
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,293
Before you succeed, why are your eyes red?

220
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:30,670
Huh?

221
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:31,751
My eyes hurt.

222
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,342
Hold on. There's another place.

223
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:36,293
- Where?
- Follow me.

224
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,286
- Inside here.
- Let's go.

225
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:38,035
Let's go.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,902
Hey, before we make a wish,
we have to cleanse our bodies at this holy spring.

227
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,457
P.

228
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:53,786
Just now I saw people using ladles to scoop up water and wash their left hands.

229
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:54,248
Yes.

230
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,884
They scooped it up again and washed their right hands.

231
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:56,284
Yes.

232
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,911
They scooped it up and washed their mouths.

233
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,102
Why do they do it?

234
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,506
They cleanse their bodies before making a wish.

235
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:03,688
Do I have to do it too?

236
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:04,915
Let's go.

237
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:05,760
Let's do this.

238
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:06,888
Look.

239
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:07,626
Yeah.

240
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,244
Do I have to pay respects?

241
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:32,017
Very refreshing.

242
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,622
Let's go.

243
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,186
I'm here.

244
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:49,964
Just a moment.

245
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm looking for coins.

246
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,333
Coins?

247
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:54,604
What will you do with it?

248
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,044
We will ask for blessings from the god Kannon inside.

249
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,662
Coins are tossed there to seek blessings from the gods.

250
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,546
So I need to find a 5 yen coin.

251
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:07,866
Why does it have to be a 5 yen coin?

252
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:09,360
Can't we use other coins?

253
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
The Japanese 5 yen coin is called 'Go-en'.

254
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,995
It's pronounced like 'Go-en' which means asking for blessings from God.

255
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:16,213
Oh.

256
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,471
Is it this one?

257
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:23,324
I have it too.

258
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:24,648
Yeah.

259
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,866
Pan, can I get 5 yen from you?

260
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:30,284
Hey.

261
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,577
I see you have it.

262
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,337
Why do you have to steal from other people?

263
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:36,133
I want to keep it.

264
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:37,866
Shouldn't you just keep one coin?

265
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:40,360
Hey, I have many coins.

266
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,200
Just take it.

267
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:43,928
Please give it to me.

268
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,235
This is for you.

269
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:50,888
Thank you.

270
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:15,306
Here, for you.

271
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:18,755
Why do you have to buy it?

272
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,750
We already have a clover leaf.

273
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,880
It's more comprehensive than a talisman.

274
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,480
Alright.

275
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,742
Hey.

276
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,186
But Japanese talismans are not like Thai talismans.

277
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,275
It has an expiration date.

278
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,040
If possible, you should change it every year.

279
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:38,231
But for a better way, you should change it to the same place.

280
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,937
The place where you bought it in the first place.

281
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,755
I wouldn't buy it if I had to replace it every year.

282
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:48,826
I'm so hungry.

283
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:52,435
Hey, should we go our separate ways?

284
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,035
Yeah, good idea.

285
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:57,102
Beboy, you're going to shop around there, aren't you?

286
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:58,293
Yeah.

287
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,693
I'm going to the Edo antique market.

288
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:02,293
I've never been there.

289
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,671
I'll go with Beboy.

290
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:06,871
What about you, Pan?

291
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:08,826
Well, just go.

292
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,928
I'll walk around here.

293
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:13,680
Hey, let's do this.

294
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,968
We called each other to the meeting point after finishing.

295
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:17,760
Okay.

296
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:18,791
Bye.

297
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,920
I'll text you.

298
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,346
Hey.

299
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:23,226
Where are you going?

300
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:25,164
I'll walk around here.

301
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,675
Why don't you go with me?

302
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:27,804
Come with me.

303
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:31,368
I didn't think you wanted to go with me in the first place.

304
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:32,755
Alright.

305
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:33,964
Please?

306
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:35,955
Yeah.

307
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,333
Let's go together.

308
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:55,457
I really envy you that you get to live in Japan.

309
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:57,333
Why?

310
00:18:59,217 --> 00:18:59,920
Look.

311
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:01,884
It has many trees.

312
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,106
Wherever we look, we see it.

313
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,871
Even your neighborhood has a park.

314
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,235
Do you like it?

315
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,075
So much.

316
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,035
When I don't have ideas for lyrics,

317
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,866
I usually stay in places with lots of trees like this.

318
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:22,471
Why?

319
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,631
What do trees help you?

320
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:28,151
Yeah.

321
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,666
When I am surrounded by green space,

322
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,471
it relaxes both my eyes and my mind.

323
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,266
When I got home,

324
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:40,853
I immediately had an idea.

325
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:50,995
If you don't believe me,

326
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,422
please try changing from the bar

327
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:55,626
and going near the tree.

328
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,160
It might make you feel better.

329
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:09,191
Normally, how do you use nature to help you?

330
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,488
It's not difficult.

331
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:15,635
I'll show you a simple one.

332
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:16,320
Well.

333
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:18,844
First of all, you have to close your eyes.

334
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,853
And think only of good things.

335
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,609
Take a deep breath.

336
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,368
Something like this.

337
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,137
Do you want to try it?

338
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:30,764
No.

339
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,013
Hey.

340
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:35,342
Let's try it once.

341
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:36,355
No.

342
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,413
Close your eyes.

343
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:39,520
No.

344
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,453
Close your eyes first.

345
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,124
Alright.

346
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,813
Take a deep breath.

347
00:20:58,062 --> 00:20:59,555
Think only of good things.

348
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:04,071
How are you?

349
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:05,742
Do you feel anything?

350
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:10,604
Maybe good?

351
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,022
Can I request something from you?

352
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:16,542
Yeah.

353
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,417
I want you to think of trees when you're stressed.

354
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,177
So that you'll miss me sometimes.

355
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:43,991
Here.

356
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:47,973
Thank you.

357
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,280
Pan.

358
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:58,088
Why?

359
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,813
Uh...

360
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:01,920
I have something to apologize to you.

361
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:03,875
What?

362
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:08,284
When I annoyed you when we first met.

363
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:11,662
I think it's something else.

364
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:15,715
I want to clear everything up.

365
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
Because you are going back to Thailand.

366
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:19,688
I don't want anything to be left unresolved.

367
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:21,920
That's okay.

368
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:23,564
I can't.

369
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,840
Otherwise, it will stay in my heart.

370
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,048
I'm worried.

371
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:30,791
But...

372
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:33,493
you...

373
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,968
can forgive me, right?

374
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:37,315
Sure.

375
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,084
Why not?

376
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:40,657
Really?

377
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes.

378
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,915
I also have something I want to tell you.

379
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:50,133
Yeah.

380
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:58,648
Many people say that a teenager's life only happens once, right?

381
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:00,933
We must use it worthwhile.

382
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,204
I think it's true.

383
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:09,413
But I want you to plan your life.

384
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:12,097
So that you will be happy in the future.

385
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:14,577
So that you can be yourself.

386
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,728
Yeah, I know.

387
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:20,800
Do you know?

388
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,257
Since the first day I met you.

389
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:25,208
Yeah.

390
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,666
There is never a time when I feel bad about you.

391
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:31,964
On the other hand,

392
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:34,675
I like everything about you.

393
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:42,044
Especially confidence and faith in yourself.

394
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:45,777
Please maintain it well.

395
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,573
I believe that no matter what you hope for,

396
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,306
your faith and belief will make you successful.

397
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:55,973
Well, I promise you.

398
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:55,840
Hurry up.

399
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,309
It has many shops.

400
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,786
Yeah.

401
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:58,835
Shall we rest here?

402
00:24:58,951 --> 00:24:59,608
Great idea.

403
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:14,720
Really refreshing.

404
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:15,937
Are you tired yet?

405
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:18,008
A little.

406
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,760
But I feel better after drinking water.

407
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,404
It will be finished after we look at a few more shops.

408
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:27,768
Would you like to go back and buy something else?

409
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:28,906
I will walk with you.

410
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:30,124
Don't be considerate of me.

411
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:32,595
No.

412
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,999
(Where are you?)
(What are you doing?)
(You didn't answer me at all)

413
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,760
(There is no signal after I call you)
(Did anything happen to you?)

414
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,560
(Now I know in my heart that I love only you, Plai. I want to apologize to you.
Please forgive me. Please come back and love each other like before.)

415
00:25:59,937 --> 00:26:00,808
Answer him.

416
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:06,933
Don't make him wait long for your answer.

417
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:09,377
It's not good.

418
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:29,528
Just answer him.

419
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:38,515
I even chose for you some outstanding clovers related to love.

420
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:42,204
Achieve it.

421
00:26:44,648 --> 00:26:46,177
So that you won't regret it later.

422
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:53,813
Beboy.

423
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:55,608
Huh?

424
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,644
Before I answer his phone,

425
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:00,622
can I ask you something?

426
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:04,533
Yeah, just ask me.

427
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,386
At the temple that day,

428
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,511
what did you pray for?

429
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:17,040
Are you really want to know it?

430
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,391
I'll tell you.

431
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,440
I made a wish about

432
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,075
finding someone who is nice,

433
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:35,208
cute,

434
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:36,853
and has a sweet smile

435
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,431
beside me,

436
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,733
and that person is...

437
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,026
the person in front of me right now.

438
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,222
Your clover is truly amazing.

439
00:27:57,288 --> 00:27:58,951
It can really make miracles happen.

440
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:15,608
Are you getting better from tiredness?

441
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:19,546
Yes.

442
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:25,928
Are we going to continue or stop here?

443
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,871
Let's continue looking for P and Pan.

444
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:37,084
As for shopping, stop here.

445
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:39,991
Let's go.

446
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,404
Hold on.

447
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:43,440
What?

448
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:45,555
I have something to give you.

449
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:55,306
5 yen coin.

450
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,062
Yeah.

451
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:06,328
P said that Japanese people call 5 yen coins 'Go-en'.

452
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,288
It's pronounced like 'Go-en'.

453
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:12,577
Its meaning is to ask for blessings from God.

454
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:18,675
People who carry 5 yen coins, single people will find a good soul mate.

455
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,502
Whoever already has a lover, they will love each other for a long time.

456
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:28,568
Another meaning is...

457
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:33,484
to meet again.

458
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:37,342
Thank you.

459
00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:41,795
I kept it especially for you.

460
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:49,493
Here.

461
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,653
I have one coin.

462
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:54,906
For you.

463
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:02,577
It will make us meet again in Thailand.

464
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:05,582
And love each other forever.

465
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,466
It's like the coin's prediction.

466
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:13,280
Yeah.

467
00:30:18,186 --> 00:30:18,951
Let's go.

468
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:20,960
Shall we go?

469
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:25,848
Please pull me up.

470
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:45,440
P.

471
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,951
Beboy.

472
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:48,950
I'm going back.

473
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:49,706
Yeah.

474
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,217
Thank you.

475
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,128
My pleasure.

476
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:56,355
Please come see me sometimes if you have time.

477
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,511
I have many places I want to take you to.

478
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:03,440
Sure.

479
00:31:05,457 --> 00:31:06,071
Hey.

480
00:31:06,728 --> 00:31:07,671
Don't cry.

481
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:12,293
I told you not to cry.

482
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:13,313
Why are you crying?

483
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:13,884
Huh?

484
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:17,297
Well, I won't cry.

485
00:31:19,386 --> 00:31:20,231
But, P.

486
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:20,755
Yeah.

487
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:24,551
Do I have a chance to meet you in Thailand?

488
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:26,977
I don't know.

489
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,069
Sometimes, I might go back to Thailand.

490
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,800
Who knows?

491
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,568
You said it.

492
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:37,742
Yeah.

493
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:42,604
If you are going back to Thailand, you must tell me first.

494
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:43,635
I don't know.

495
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,031
Take care yourself.

496
00:31:53,102 --> 00:31:53,617
Yeah.

497
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:59,155
Thank you, P.

498
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,600
For not abandoning me and Pan that day.

499
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:02,844
My pleasure.

500
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:08,355
I apologize if I did something that offended you.

501
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,791
Same as me.

502
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,177
I hope we will meet again.

503
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,155
Good luck.

504
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:25,680
Plai.

505
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:26,435
Hurry up.

506
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:35,742
P.

507
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:36,835
Yeah.

508
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,893
Do you know?

509
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:43,600
That this trip

510
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:47,830
has brought me great happiness.

511
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:53,288
Thank you so much.

512
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,400
Don't forget to keep my promise.

513
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:00,240
Yeah.

514
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
I promise you.

515
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,320
Pan.

516
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,475
I have something important to tell you.

517
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,337
Uh...

518
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:20,266
I...

519
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:26,666
I wish you good luck.

520
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:32,408
Can I hug you one last time?

521
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,577
Sure.

522

♫ I want to thank you for making me know ♫

559
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:11,431
♫ the love that I thought was good ♫

560
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:17,600
♫ Today I got the answer, you don't need to explain ♫

561
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:25,680
♫ No matter who I'm with, I still miss you ♫

562
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:31,810
♫ The better the memory, the more painful it is ♫

563
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:37,700
♫ I can never forget you ♫

564
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:41,955
♫ The old love is still deeply etched in my heart ♫

565
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,840
♫ Every word is still the same as in the past ♫

566
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:49,786
♫ I know it hurts, but why doesn't it end? ♫

567
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:53,288
♫ It's painful every time ♫

568
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,440
♫ I just need time to forget it ♫

569
00:36:57,804 --> 00:37:01,528
♫ But don't be longer than this ♫

570
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,906
♫ Just being able to let go for a minute, ♫

571
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:08,053
♫ I'm pleased ♫
