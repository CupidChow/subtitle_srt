Guys.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,620
I'm really asking you guys.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,540
Are we really going to walk around in this outfit?

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,410
Why are you shy?

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,080
It's cute.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,720
Yeah.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,520
Yeah.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,760
Show it, friend.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,050
It's a strange thing.

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,650
Strange things from Thailand.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,190
Hey.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,610
We're at a ghost release party, we should release it fully.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,390
This time!

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,390
Ghost sees ghost.
(People of the same type and people of the same type)

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:46,830
Hey.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,520
You all dress like everyone else.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
But I dress strangely.

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,460
It's like I walked out of McDonald's.

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,270
Look, P.

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,680
There were a lot of people.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,540
No one can beat you.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,810
So cool, P.

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:00:59,880
Look.

25
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,960
Everyone dresses up as a ghost.

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,840
F♪ck!

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,580
Don't taunt me.

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,330
I didn't think they wouldn't organize an event.

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,330
Stop it.

30
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,420
I think this costume should go in a suitcase.

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,630
We shouldn't waste time and dress it up.

32
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,490
I'm really embarrassed by Japanese people.

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,420
I think so.

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,220
Well.

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,580
May I walk separately with you?

36
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,110
May I walk that way?

37
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,700
Please?

38
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,640
Can I walk separately with you?

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
You really love me.

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,370
Hey.

41
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,820
Okay. That's it.

42
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,079
I'll walk that way.

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,720
Well.

44
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,170
Well.

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,639
We'll meet around here at 11 p.m.

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:44,880
Umm.

47
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:46,740
Or in front of the train station at 11 p.m.

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,910
I'll go with Beboy.

49
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,260
Please take care of him.

50
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,560
He is a fool.

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,030
Let's go.

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,170
There are a lot of people.

53
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,730
My legs are tired.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,050
Well, sit here.

55
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,900
Your costume is really annoying.

56
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,260
Hey.

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,060
When I realized it again, it was already 11:00 p.m.

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,790
Umm.

59
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,390
Are you tired?

60
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,620
A little bit.

61
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,780
Where else would you like to walk?

62
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,960
No.

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,640
So I think... should we wait for them in front of the train station?

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,510
It's in front here.

65
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,510
Umm.

66
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:29,980
Let's go.

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Before going there, please take off my hat for me.

68
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,260
I can't breathe.

69
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,800
Okay.

70
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,640
Okay.

71
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,440
Well.

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Come on.

73
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,480
Just a moment.

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,240
Okay. Oh!

75
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,319
P!

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,850
Sorry.

77
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,460
I'm hurt.

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,320
Sorry.

79
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,920
Sorry. Oh. Sorry.

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,699
P, please do it carefully.

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,350
Please be careful.

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,480
Okay?

83
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,309
Wow.

84
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,110
Hey, don't move.

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Hurry up.

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,130
Let's go.

87
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,010
Go.

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,710
It has flown up.

89
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,950
Bat Man.

90
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,770
What are you doing?

91
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,570
Turn it around.

92
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:47,980
Oh.

93
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,130
Have you guys arrived?

94
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,510
Yeah.

95
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,480
Why did you guys arrive so quickly?

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Isn't it fun?

97
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,700
It's fun.

98
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,000
But I'm tired.

99
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,540
Also, I've walked all over and don't know where to go next.

100
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,570
Here.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,830
Pan.

102
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,140
- Thank you.
- P.

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,050
Thank you.

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey, Pan.

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,580
Slow down.

106
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,690
Why are you so thirsty?

107
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,820
No.

108
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,710
P.

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,350
Yeah.

110
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,880
Can I have a beer here for a moment?

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,420
Sure.

112
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,430
But I only have a little time for you.

113
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,880
But if you want to enjoy, you can take a taxi home.

114
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,680
I have no problems with it.

115
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,040
I have to return to my country tomorrow.

116
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,360
I don't know when I will have another good and fun experience in this life.

117
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,380
You will.

118
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,500
There was a first time, there must be a second time.

119
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,920
I had to overcome fear for more than 10 years.

120
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,860
I regret those times.

121
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,710
Hey.

122
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,140
Beboy.

123
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,970
Why do you have to get serious?

124
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,320
P.

125
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,540
Traveling to Japan this time

126
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,460
opened up my narrow world.

127
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,660
Thank you so much.

128
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,070
Without you,

129
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,480
I don't know that in this life

130
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,440
I would have had the opportunity to walk out of the rambutan garden

131
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,860
and take a walk in Shinjuku.

132
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,620
When?

133
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,150
From the first day until today,

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,670
you made me feel so lucky

135
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,120
to have a friend like you.

136
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,570
Yeah.

137
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,230
Not only me.

138
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,850
But you are also good.

139
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,100
You can come to Japan alone.

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,230
Hey, I'll tell you something.

141
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,100
You can come to Japan alone like this,

142
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,060
no matter where you want to go in the world,

143
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
you can go there.

144
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,940
Remember this, friend.

145
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,360
Sure, P.

146
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,340
I will remember every word you told me.

147
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,430
Well.

148
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,510
You're about to return to your country now.

149
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,730
I want to say something.

150
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,610
Sure.

151
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,360
I want to say that this Japan trip,

152
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,610
Plai and I...

153
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,290
It's so much better than any other trip.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,030
Usually, it's just us who go on trips.

155
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,430
It might seem fun.

156
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,730
How is it?

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
It's not fun.

158
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,530
It feels stressful and lonely.

159
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,370
I can't describe it.

160
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,920
Yes.

161
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,010
But I can say this this time.

162
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,290
I'm so happy.

163
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,600
Me too.

164
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Beboy.

165
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,650
Thank you very much for deciding not to abandon us that day.

166
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,040
What?

167
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,560
Hey, twins!

168
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,690
Come on! Sit with us.

169
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,840
Where do you guys stay?

170
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,130
Oh, I don't know it yet.

171
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,250
Both of us booked the hotel on the wrong day.

172
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,340
So we had to find a new hotel.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,880
So let's do it like this?

174
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,670
Let's stay at P's house first.

175
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,340
Okay?

176
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,790
I promise that I will try to be a famous artist

177
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,210
and release beautiful songs for you to listen to.

178
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,130
You can definitely do it.

179
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,230
I'll wait to listen to it.

180
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,230
Great, friend.

181
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,400
P.

182
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,410
I also thank you for giving us a place to stay.

183
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah.

184
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,020
And thank you for making my love song so perfect.

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,660
I will never forget you.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,110
Yes, P.

187
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
Without you,

188
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,550
our love songs wouldn't exist.

189
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,690
Thank you so much.

190
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,910
If we finish filming,

191
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,910
I will definitely send it to you.

192
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,760
But seriously,

193
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,640
I have to thank you guys.

194
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,370
Do you know? I am very lucky to have met you all.

195
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:42,100
Do you know how good I feel that you guys were with me these 5 days?

196
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,330
I don't feel lonely at all.

197
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,820
Yeah.

198
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,040
Cheers.

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,330
Why must you be sad?

200
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,770
D♪mn!

201
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,210
It's close to midnight.

202
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,090
We're going to miss the last train.

203
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,080
Hurry up.

204
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,540
Let's go. It's still timely.

205
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,500
Let's go! Hurry up!

206
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,710
Have we forgotten something?

207
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,000
Beboy.

208
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,920
Beboy.

209
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,290
What's wrong with you?

210
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,930
Why are you sitting here?

211
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,220
Hey.

212
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,160
What happened with you?

213
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,350
Hey.

214
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,140
Let's drink beer.

215
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,690
Come on.

216
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,450
Beboy.

217
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,440
Let's drink beer.

218
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,030
We will drink until morning today.

219
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:45,940
Huh?

220
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,820
No vomiting, no stopping.

221
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,760
If anyone fell asleep, beer would be poured into their mouths.

222
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,880
P.

223
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,729
What?

224
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,000
What's wrong with you, Beboy?

225
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,030
Huh?

226
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,900
You'll be going back to Thailand tomorrow anyway,

227
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,330
wouldn't it be better for you to spend the rest of your time happily?

228
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,740
Hey.

229
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,100
You're...

230
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,670
Here.

231
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,490
Oh, sorry.

232
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:21,940
Here.

233
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,800
I open for you.

234
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,770
Plai.

235
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,200
Have you slept?

236
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,640
Aren't you going downstairs?

237
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,750
I'm not in that mood.

238
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,420
Are you sure?

239
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,819
Normally, you never miss being drunk.

240
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,290
Huh?

241
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,280
What's wrong with him?

242
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,140
Plai.

243
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,270
Did anything happen to you?

244
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,020
Are you sure?

245
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,720
Hey, what's wrong with you?

246
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,980
Plai!

247
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,400
What's wrong?

248
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,260
Do you have pain in your body, legs or arms?

249
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,680
Are you sick?

250
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,690
Hey.

251
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,660
Why are you crying? You can tell me.

252
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,220
I don't know.

253
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,480
I feel strange.

254
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,660
Sad.

255
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,300
Lonely. I can't explain it.

256
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,640
I think it's something bad.

257
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,240
We're just separating here.

258
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,330
We can meet in Thailand, isn't that so?

259
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,800
What about you, Pan?

260
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,180
What's next?

261
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,600
I don't know.

262
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,200
I must leave it like that.

263
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,690
Is that so?

264
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,170
Yeah.

265
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,000
I feel sorry for you, Pan.

266
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,830
Don't pity me.

267
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Just pity yourself.

268
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,080
I'm going downstairs now.

269
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,360
Follow me later.

270
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,090
Hey.

271
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,600
Why are you guys depressed like this?

272
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,080
Don't you feel anything?

273
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,030
I feel it!

274
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,310
But I just don't show it.

275
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,560
Also, everyone is sitting together here.

276
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,520
Huh?

277
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,880
Today is the last day.

278
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,290
Isn't it better that we make it happy?

279
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,650
Come on.

280
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,630
Let's get drunk until morning for today!

281
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,620
What about Plai?

282
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,320
He will come later.

283
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,400
Here.

284
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,360
Yours too.

285
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,410
Hey!

286
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,960
Are you in a hurry?

287
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,560
Let's cheers first.

288
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,480
Hurry up!

289
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,380
Let's cheers, Beboy.

290
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,930
Hurry. Come on.

291
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,490
1, 2, 3 Go! Cheers!

292
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,620
Hey.

293
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,040
Are you in a hurry?

294
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,620
Please wait for your friend.

295
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,010
You guys are really in a hurry.

296
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,620
You will be drunk to death.

297
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,840
You are slow and still have a bad mouth.

298
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,710
Hey.

299
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,880
Well.

300
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,680
This is yours.

301
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,280
Hold on!

302
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,900
Bottoms up.

303
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,120
Sure.

304
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,060
Yes.

305
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,600
It must be like this!

306
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,720
That person

307
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,230
just drank the whole can, right?

308
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,760
Don't mind him.

309
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,760
Beboy is a lightweight person.

310
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,420
He gets drunk on snacks, not beer.

311
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,250
Hey!

312
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,310
Beboy.

313
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,670
Calm down.

314
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,300
Hey.

315
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,410
Energy, come on!

316
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,190
Nothing. I just want to get drunk.

317
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,120
Why?

318
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,640
Let do this?

319
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,630
Let's drink really hard tonight.

320
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,210
Whoever vomits first becomes a dog and walks on all fours, okay?

321
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,360
Sure.

322
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,030
Howl too, is that good?

323
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,120
Yeah.

324
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,660
I'm not afraid anyway.

325
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,500
Come on!

326
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:04,790
Go!

327
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's cheers. What are you guys waiting for?

328
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,100
The chicken looks delicious.

329
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,880
Huh.

330
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,949
Don't eat too much chicken.

331
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,370
Cheers!

332
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,230
Let's cheers again!

333
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,610
Hurry up! Cheers again.

334
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,240
Well.

335
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,360
Let's get drunk with beer, not snacks.

336
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,200
You guys give me high energy!

337
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,090
High?

338
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,519
You guys give me high energy!

339
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,220
Yeah.

340
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,870
You're not depressed anymore.

341
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,110
Come on!

342
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,100
Shall we cheers with chicken?

343
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:47,220
Shall we cheers with chicken this time?

344
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,230
Cheers with chicken?

345
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,220
Yes! Cheers with chicken this time.

346
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,320
Well, cheers with chicken, right?

347
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,380
Cheers with chicken?

348
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,420
It's a step.

349
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,969
- We cheer with beers, we have to cheers with chicken too.
- Come on!

350
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,030
1, 2, 3. Go!

351
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,460
This chicken is very soft.

352
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,460
Beboy...

353
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,480
Hey.

354
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,480
I feel like I want to pee.

355
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,480
Let me go to the bathroom first.

356
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,690
Yeah.

357
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:15,880
I'll be back. Wait for me.

358
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,750
Don't take my food.

359
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,480
Yeah.

360
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,810
Will you vomit?

361
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,420
Yes, did he secretly vomit?

362
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,640
You look down on your friends too much.

363
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,939
You mean we're right, right?

364
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,180
Yes, we're right.

365
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,520
You're right.

366
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,340
Is it delicious?

367
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,030
Yes.

368
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,600
It's a bit cold.

369
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,120
D♪mn.

370
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:40,629
He was depressed earlier.

371
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,630
He acted depressed.

372
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,499
You guys really know.

373
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,930
After we said that the person who puked first was a dog, you immediately cheered.

374
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,790
Oh, I forgot.

375
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,840
That's okay.

376
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
What is that?

377
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,060
Here.

378
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,630
I give it to you.

379
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,600
What is that?

380
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,160
Hey.

381
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,880
Do the two of you secretly send love letters to each other?

382
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,960
What love letters do you mean?

383
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,090
Open it.

384
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,230
What?

385
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,950
Well, just open it.

386
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,160
Hey!

387
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,090
Thank you.

388
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,210
Yeah.

389
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,380
Where do you get the time to do it?

390
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm not telling you.

391
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,210
Amazing.

392
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,710
Look at this.

393
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,710
Plai, look at this.

394
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,010
It has this language.

395
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,060
Hey.

396
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,320
When you finish recording, don't forget to send it to me.

397
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,230
Yes, sure.

398
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,230
I'll send it to you first.

399
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,440
Well, let's cheers.

400
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,700
Come on. Let's cheers!

401
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,489
Cheers!

402
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,290
If you don't cheers, I'll give you cold chicken.

403
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,670
Why are you guys depressed?

404
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,550
Are you drunk?

405
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,300
Who's drunk?

406
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,090
Not me.

407
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,570
Uh, Pan.

408
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,830
Have you packed your suitcase yet?

409
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,860
Yes.

410
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,890
Why?

411
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,840
I haven't packed it yet.

412
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,930
Let me go pack it.

413
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,050
I'm worried that I won't be able to pack my suitcase in time in the morning.

414
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,820
Yeah.

415
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,210
I'll go now.

416
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,770
Plai.

417
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,760
I will help you.

418
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,810
Sure.

419
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,810
Do we secretly follow and watch them?

420
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,520
Huh?

421
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,060
Just take a break.

422
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,570
Plai, wait for me.

423
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,230
Yeah.

424
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,000
I will help you pack your suitcase.

425
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,200
Sure.

426
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,280
Wait.

427
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
Can I...

428
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,070
ask you something?

429
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,210
What?

430
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,410
When you said you broke up with your ex,

431
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,860
what was the reason for the breakup?

432
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,380
Hey.

433
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,290
It's okay if you don't want to answer it.

434
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,280
I'm just asking randomly.

435
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,620
Don't mind me.

436
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,120
It's not like that.

437
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,690
If you want to know,

438
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,850
I'll tell you.

439
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,740
I broke up with my ex

440
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,910
because I...

441
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,030
This part.

442
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,720
Umm.

443
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:35,920
