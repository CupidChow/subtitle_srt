What are you doing?

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,880
We...

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,800
We were just in a sham marriage.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Embrace this,

29
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
like you did before.

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
(You still remember it.)

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,920
Since it's a sham marriage,

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,520
let me clarify my rules first.

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Here are my thoughts.

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,040
Take a look.

35
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,040
I'll open the door.

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,800
Ms. Yang?

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,960
You alone?

38
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,000
Where is Fanyu?

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,040
Fanyu.

40
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,640
Fanyu.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
When will you

42
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,960
acknowledge me as Mrs. Xue?

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,520
(Is he hiding from his visiting)

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,240
(old flame?)

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
So soon after your nuptials,

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,080
living apart?

47
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,760
(She's so eager to be Mrs. Xue.)

48
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,440
(Also framing me.)

49
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
(No matter what her purpose,)

50
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,080
(do the opposite of her desire.)

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,960
We've got a guest?

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,480
Yiyi.

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Fanyu.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,480
Ms. Yang said we're living apart.

55
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,920
I just showered upstairs.

56
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,800
Apart?

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,280
Right.

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,640
Seems I got it wrong.

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,640
I was wondering
why Song didn't go to work today.

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,560
Even an ordinary employee

61
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
has a seven-day vacation.

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,480
How could Song be merely
an ordinary employee?

63
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll take her myself

64
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,560
to get familiar with everything.

65
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,480
I listen to Fanyu.

66
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
Since you're so inseparable,

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,080
I'll leave then.

68
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
Take care, stepmother.

69
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Then you should hurry up.

70
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,880
Have more kids.

71
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
She's your stepmother?

72
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,720
Yes, what else?

73
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,640
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

74
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,280
Calling herself

75
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,120
Mrs. Xue all the time.

76
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,200
I misunderstood.

77
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,440
My dad's also Mr. Xue.

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Have you read my rules?

79
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,640
The conditions are simple.

80
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,680
Why return to the company at all?

81
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,760
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

82
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
It tastes quite good.

83
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
I understand your situation.

84
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Wait for seven days.

85
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,840
Seven days?

86
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,520
Then the marriage leave expires.

87
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,880
You can go back.

88
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,320
Let me out.

89
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,560
I agreed that you return
to the company in a week.

90
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
But I didn't agree that you leave here.

91
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
What!

92
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,760
(Wanna confine me? No way!)

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Good idea.

94
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
But drop it.

95
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,760
You'll be dizzy in a moment.

96
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,960
See how you'll stop me!

97
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,240
Wanna drug me?

98
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,480
How would I?

99
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
Just preparing the seasoning.

100
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Here it is.

101
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,520
Taste it.

102
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
Enjoy it hot.

103
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,560
It's so hot.

104
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,120
I can't drink it.

105
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,840
Let me cool it for you.

106
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,960
It won't be hot.

107
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,720
Hmm, not hot.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,760
Drink up.

109
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,520
It's good, isn't it?

110
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Mushrooms are growing here.

111
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,720
Here too.

112
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
So many mushrooms!

113
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
They are growing on my body too.

114
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,560
Such a big mushroom!

115
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,800
Mushroom, stop there.

116
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
I surrender.

117
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,599
(12:00)

118
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,400
What did I do last night?

119
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,400
I just wanted to stay away from him.

120
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm going to lose it if this keeps up.

121
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,840
Wait.

122
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,000
So obvious?

123
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,280
