Right, let's go.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
See you.

28
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,240
See you.

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
(This fragrance)

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
(smells familiar.)

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,160
Mom.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
What are you mixing?

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
Yiyi, you scared me.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,880
Smell it.

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
It smells great.

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,320
We are cooking up some magic.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,480
Just for you!

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,640
Amazing!

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,600
It's our secret.

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Can I have it now?

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,680
When I finish casting the spell,

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
I'll give it to you.

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay?

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,880
Sure.

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,960
(Mom.)

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
(I finally got it.)

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,480
Hello, Xue.

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,880
It's off work. Shall we meet?

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,600
Okay.

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
Look.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
Let's see

52
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,160
who's tougher.

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,800
Xue.

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,840
What's up?

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
This is

56
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,240
the first time you've asked me out.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,560
Did you change your perfume?

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
The scent is rather unique.

59
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Yep.

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,240
This is my...

61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,440
What's this?

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
House certificate.

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,880
And company shares.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,720
No, thanks.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,120
This gift is too precious.

66
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
Gift?

67
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
Sure.

68
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,920
Gift

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
for

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
a month of marriage.

71
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,160
If you're giving me this now,

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,480
what are you gonna get me

73
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,720
for our first, third,

74
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,680
and tenth anniversaries?

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,120
You're mistaken.

76
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,920
Xue.

77
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
I also have a gift for you.

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,000
This is

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,400
the surprise you prepared?

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,960
Yep.

81
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,360
I want it to be a bit ceremonial.

82
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,400
Have a good rest.

83
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
Xue Fanyu.

84
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,080
You can't keep ignoring me like this.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
You really don't have to do this.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm not a child.

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Are you sure?

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Yep.

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
Scared?

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,920
Not at all.

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,640
Your fear is evident.

92
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,600
Still don't want divorce?

93
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,720
(Divorce Agreement)

94
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
- I think you got it wrong.
- Xue.

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
I also have a gift for you.

96
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
Xue.

97
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,880
There's no need to force it.

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,200
No matter what,

99
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
even if we're divorced,

100
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,200
or not related by blood,

101
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
I am always your

102
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,160
family.

103
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,073
(Divorce Agreement)

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
(Why does he bring up divorce?)

105
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,480
Mr. Xue, if the capital chain breaks,

106
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
the loss would be substantial.

107
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
Mr. Xue, you stood up Mr. Wu.

108
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
So now he's pulling his funding.

109
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,840
What's your plan?

110
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,160
Why still asking Mr. Xue?

111
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
Ms. Wu is right here.

112
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
My dad's pretty set in his decisions.

113
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,880
It's tough for me to change his mind.

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,960
But if we are family,

115
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
it would be much easier

116
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,280
to solve family issues.

117
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,720
Right, right.

118
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Mr. Xue.

119
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,600
You and Ms. Wu were supposed to marry.

120
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,840
But Mr. Xue is married.

121
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,000
After all, this is his private matter.

122
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,760
We can't judge here.

123
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,200
Right?

124
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,120
However, Mr. Xue.

125
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,320
Gotta weigh the pros and cons.

126
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,200
Think about which is more important,

127
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
your wife or your company.

128
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,720
Look,

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
what you're worried about

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
isn't gonna happen.

131
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,160
I've got other ways

132
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,200
to handle the money situation.

133
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
So, we're all good.

134
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,840
Adjourned.

135
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,600
Fanyu.

136
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,160
There is something

137
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,200
that you just can't muscle through.

138
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,080
Only I

139
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
can protect your parents' legacy.

140
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
That Song

141
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,000
can't really help with anything.

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,320
Yes, that's right.

143
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,440
- Yes.
- Indeed.

144
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,320
Why can't I help?

145
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,440
How?

146
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,880
Mr. Liu,

147
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
why don't you just drive Xue Fanyu out?

148
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,720
I can then restart the Peerless Rose.

149
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,400
You'll get my repayment with interest.

150
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,440
I have the Peerless Rose.

151
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,680
Where did you get the Peerless Rose?

152
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
How could I have the Peerless Rose.

153
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,960
But I do wanna gift you roses.

154
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,440
Then why did you promise them

155
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,760
to deliver it within three days?

156
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,760
I thought you had it.

157
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,120
I already terminated that plan.

158
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,960
I have my ways.

159
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,840
No worries about this.

160
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
Sign the divorce agreement.

161
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
I will figure out the rest.

162
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:25,242
(Divorce Agreement)

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
Why laughing?

164
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,920
Xue.

165
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,200
You're so much into me, aren't you?

166
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,440
You saw Wu Di going after the company
for the marriage.

167
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
You fear she'd come after me too.

168
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
So you wanted a divorce,

169
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
to cut ties with me.

170
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,200
Everything you do

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,720
is to protect me.

172
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,480
So,

173
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,040
as a repeat offender,

174
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,720
you've lost all credibility with me.

to clarify it.

187
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,280
Really?

188
