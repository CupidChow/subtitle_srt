What's wrong?

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Like this one?

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,440
Yep.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,160
I'll go try it.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,000
Hmm.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,720
Hello?

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Ms. Yang.

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,960
(Shaofei.)

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
(I'm sorry.)

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,920
(I took advantage of you.)

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,680
Song.

37
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,400
Song.

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
(Who is this?)

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
(What's he shooting?)

40
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Running away?

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Blame yourself
for provoking the wrong person.

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,280
It's me.

43
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Xue Fanyu?

44
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,680
It's okay now.

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Meng Shaofei

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,600
can't protect you at all.

47
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,040
Marrying someone you don't love

48
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,680
will only make you regret.

49
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:42,869
(Three Years Ago)

50
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,360
(Xue.)

51
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,080
(I've finally come of age.)

52
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680
(Happy birthday.)

53
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,480
(Xue.)

54
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,160
(I like you.)

55
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,040
(I want to be with you forever.)

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,480
How do you know

57
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
I don't like him?

58
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,040
Because I know

59
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,040
what you look like

60
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
when you do.

61
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,680
You're too young.

62
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,760
Don't know what like means.

63
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
You should

64
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
go and see the world.

65
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,600
Xue.

66
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,680
Right, I don't like him.

67
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm using him. So what?

68
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
Song.

69
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,200
Shaofei.

70
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,480
Well, I...

71
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,280
You planned this.

72
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
Despicable.

73
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,040
Master, thanks for the notice.

74
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,480
I'll take her back first.

75
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Actually...

76
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,160
I don't know what's going on
between you two.

77
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,040
But I know

78
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,360
you don't like me that much.

79
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,440
I also know

80
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,800
everything you do

81
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,280
is for staying in the core team.

82
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,040
Mr. Meng,

83
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,840
maybe

84
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,560
we should not get married.

85
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,360
No.

86
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
Whatever the reason,

87
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,520
as long as I can be with you,

88
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,480
I'd be content.

89
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Rubbish.

90
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,760
It's all because that Xue Fanyu meddled.

91
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,080
That wench.

92
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,480
Hooking up with Meng Shaofei.

93
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
And now Xue Fanyu as well.

94
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,960
Ms. Yang.

95
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,200
Maybe we just leave it.

96
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
- We can't beat her.
- Shut up.

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
No place for you to talk here.

98
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,840
Ms. Yang.

99
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Here's your file.

100
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,600
Shaofei.

101
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,600
You finally came.

102
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,520
Well,

103
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,960
your taste is quite similar to
your master's.

104
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,160
Even fancy the same woman.

105
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,040
Ms. Yang.

106
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
It's inappropriate.

107
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,840
You should find someone else
to deliver files.

108
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,600
I won't.

109
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,680
Sorry, Mr. Xue.

110
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,760
My dereliction of duty.

111
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,880
I'll be more attentive.

112
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,400
By the way,

113
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,560
Yang Nana talked to Miss Song privately.

114
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
Mr. Xue.

115
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,840
Ms. Yang has been
coveting your position.

116
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,760
Her methods remain as tough
as three years ago.

117
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,680
Then,

118
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,400
Miss Song's wedding...

119
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,520
Their wedding

120
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,960
will be held right here.

121
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll take a call.

122
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,720
Hello, Master.

123
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,440
Okay, okay.

124
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
What are you doing here?

125
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
I'll ask you one last time.

126
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Have you thought it through?

127
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,800
Why do you care?

128
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
Take her away.

129
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,400
The missing 5 million
from the firm's account

130
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,560
appears in your account.

131
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
How do you

132
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
explain this?

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,720
You asked me to apply for this purchase.

134
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,240
Do I need to apply to make a purchase?

135
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,400
Moreover,

136
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,920
the firm doesn't have any purchase plan.

137
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,160
Mr. Xue,

138
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
am I right?

139
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,600
Indeed, no plan.

140
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Take her away.

141
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Wait a moment.

142
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
It's true that the firm

143
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,800
doesn't have any purchase plan.

144
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
But this 5 million has nothing

145
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
to do with the firm.

146
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,960
What do you mean?

147
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,800
Because this 5 million...

148
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,360
Oh, sorry.

149
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
This 5.2 million

150
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,200
is my gift

151
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,520
for the bride.

152
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,080
Today is my wedding with Yiyi.

153
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,480
