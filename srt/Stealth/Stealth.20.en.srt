Mr. Xue.

Brother.

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,120
You really disgust me.

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,520
You clearly knew my identity.

57
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,000
Yet you took me as your disciple

58
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
and kept me by your side

59
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
to humiliate.

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,760
I've never wanted to humiliate you.

61
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,680

of the family fortune?

62
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160

65
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,240

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
about the Peerless Rose, right?

67
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,600

68
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
despise me

69
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880

70
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,280
But listen,

71
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
the Peerless Rose

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
simply does not exist.

73
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,000
Impossible.

74
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Absolutely impossible.

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Even if I give you the critical data,

76
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,720
you won't create it.

77
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
Impossible.

78
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,840
You're lying.

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,800
You must be lying to me.

80
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,880
I see.

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
You say all these nonsenses

82
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,800
just to get this back, right?

83
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Alright.
