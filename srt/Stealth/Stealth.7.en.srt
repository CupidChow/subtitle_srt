(Resignation Application)
(When did I write this application?)

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,640
(Disapprove. Xue Fanyu)

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,160
(It's Xue Fanyu)

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,760
(forging it to fire me?)

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,400
(Then why did he change his mind?)

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Take a sniff.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,080
What's the middle note of this scent?

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,160
It's the combination of two.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,760
Oh?

35
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,440
Then what is it?

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
White rose.

37
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,480
White rose.

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,880
Correct.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,920
And this one?

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,640
A...

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,440
C...

42
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
ACCA...

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,680
It's a hard word.

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,720
I am just a kid.

45
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,920
You are just a kid.

46
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,280
Mom forgot.

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,440
(You are just a kid.)

48
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
I know it's you.

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,560
You stole my keys,

50
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
and wanted to steal lab samples.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,800
I caught you red-handed.

52
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,840
- Gangzi.
- Yes.

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,400
Call the police.

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't.

55
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,720
Stop.

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,200
Shaofei.

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,320
Why are you here?

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
I gave her the keys.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,760
She is a newbie.

60
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,400
How could you give her the keys?

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,400
Song is one of us.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Besides, I reported it to Mr. Xue.

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,720
Go to him if you have any objections.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,760
I see.

65
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,640
Go inside.

66
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,800
Mr. Meng.

67
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,960
Sorry for the trouble again.

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Just call me Shaofei.

69
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,240
No matter what,

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,320
we are still good friends,

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
right?

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,200
Song.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,960
Hmm?

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
Aren't you...

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,440
What's wrong, Shaofei?

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,560
here looking for

77
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
something...

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,520
Shaofei.

79
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
- of your mom?
- Shaofei!

80
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,800
In today's cutthroat business landscape,

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,080
content is unquestionably the priority.

82
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,240
Mr. Li,

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm confident
you'll be pleased with our proposal.

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Ms. Yang, Mr. Xue, appreciated.

85
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
Let's start.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,680
Have you seen Mr. Meng?

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,680
He's the USB stick with the proposal.

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Isn't Shaofei here?

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
Who'll deliver the report?

90
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,520
One moment, Ms. Yang.

91
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,320
I'll go and check.

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
Wait a moment.

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,040
I'll find the persons
responsible for the proposal.

94
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,080
There's someone else
together with Mr. Meng.

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
It's the newcomer, Song Yiyi.

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
She's not here either.

97
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,240
Only they two are absent.

98
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,840
Could they be together?

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,040
Mr. Meng. Mr. Meng.

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
Wake up.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,360
Mr. Meng.

102
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,720
Mr. Xue.

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,640
We've searched everywhere.

104
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,320
Didn't find them.

105
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,160
Ms. Yang.

106
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
We've searched the firm.

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,920
No sight of Mr. Meng and Song Yiyi.

108
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,800
Are you sure
you've searched every corner?

109
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,440
Except one place.

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,240
Right here.

111
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,440
Here?

112
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
Unbelievable.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Why would they hide here?

114
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,920
How are you going to explain this?

115
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,800
Well, if you haven't searched here,

116
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,720
just go ahead.

117
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,920
(Oops.)

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,360
What is this?

119
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
Who did this?

120
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Stop it.

121
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,400
Where did it come from?

122
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,960
Stop looking.

123
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,960
Get out! Now!

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,760
Mr. Li,

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,960
Ms. Yang

126
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
pioneered the use

127
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,560
of short videos,
featuring the new product personally.

128
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,400
Isn't it more compelling and appealing

129
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
than traditional

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,600
promotional videos?

131
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,760
You agree?

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Please relax for a bit next door.

133
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
I'll be right over

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,400
to walk you through
our new product plan.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Alright, Mr. Xue.

136
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,880
This way please, Mr. Li.

137
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,840
Quite ingenious.

138
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,360
Ms. Yang.

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,400
But you may need to control your diet.

140
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
Check how chubby you look.

141
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,760
Xue Fanyu.

142
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,920
You really have something.

143
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,600
Come out.

144
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Master.

145
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
Get out.

146
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Song.

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,720
Not leaving?

148
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,080
This is why you wanted to return?

149
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,880
Such an obvious frame-up.

150
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
Can't you see it?

151
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,880
You fell for such a low-level trap!

152
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,400
Can't even button up properly.

153
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,440
Our yearly review is next month.

154
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
To access the lab,

155
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,640
just go there directly.

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,080
Besides,

157
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
stay away from Yang Nana.

158
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,400
What do you mean?

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,160
Xue Fanyu.

160
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I've reassigned the project with Mr. Li.

161
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
I've always led this project.

162
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,920
Yulin Group is my parents' life work.

163
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,520
I won't allow anyone to ruin it.

164
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm not following you.

165
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
You framed Yiyi for embezzlement,

166
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,920
and wanted to fire her.

167
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,880
But given you're my father's wife,

168
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,120
I just let go of

169
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,080
the missing 5 million.

170
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,800
Fanyu...

171
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,640
But if you ever hurt my people again,

172
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,160
you'll pay the price.
