(hiding from me?)

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Hello?

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,800
This is Wu Di.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
Ms. Wu, how can I help?

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,240
Shall we meet tonight?

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
We need to talk about Xue Fanyu.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
Sure.

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,160
You've got some nerves

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,760
coming here alone.

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Ms. Wu, what do you want?

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,160
Just say it.

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,840
A girl like you,
with no money or connections,

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,320
is not good enough for Fanyu.

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,960
You asked me here

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,320
just for this?

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Kind of silly.

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,800
Mr. Xue.

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,680
Time to go.

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,280
Got it.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
Need me to come along?

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,480
It's fine.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,800
Stay here and be with Yiyi.

48
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
Let's make a bet.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,880
In an hour,

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Fanyu will make his choice

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
between you and me.

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
He won't go with you.

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,040
Don't be so overconfident.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,880
Fanyu's mother devoted her life
in the company.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
You've no idea how important
it is to him.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Without me,

57
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,240
he will lose everything.

58
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,160
Here you are.

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,080
Haven't had dinner yet?

60
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
I'm not here for the food.

61
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,240
About the marriage alliance,

62
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,160
what do you think?

63
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,000
You know the answer.

64
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,960
My knife is sharp.

65
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
But this steak is just so tough.

66
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,280
What a waste of time.

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,680
Not afraid

68
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
you'll never see your little pet again?

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
Where is she?

70
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,320
She might be

71
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,720
somewhere here.

72
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
Great working with you!

73
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,160
Where exactly is she?

74
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,800
What do you want?

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,920
I want all of you.

76
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
In one hour,

77
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,640
I'll have your official seal.

78
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Then you may

79
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,440
see your little pet.

80
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
(So in your heart,)

81
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,800
(the company is always more important
than me.)

82
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,200
Ms. Wu said,

83
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
you're not wanted here.

84
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,120
Since I've chosen you,

85
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,280
I'd rather destroy you
if I can't have you.

86
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I won.

88
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,160
These are the compensations

89
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,480
