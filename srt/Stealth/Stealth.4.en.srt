I...

Not important.

welcome to Meng...

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,280
Wait a moment.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,840
Let me, please.

37
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
Dear guests.

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,400
Thank you for taking time

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,240
out of your busy schedule to attend

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,360
the wedding between Mr. Xue Fanyu

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
from the Yulin Group and Miss Song Yiyi.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
Now let's welcome
the bride and groom to the stage.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,360
Xue Fanyu.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,640
What are you doing?

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Xue Fanyu.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Is this fun to you?

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,040
What do you think?

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,800
Put me down.

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
Isn't Mr. Meng the groom?

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,560
Why's it Mr. Xue?

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,200
What's going on?

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
This woman is really something.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,080
Winning Mr. Xue over.

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,480
Exactly.

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Now, please welcome Mr. Xue
from the Yulin Group to say something.

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,960
Thank you all
for attending my wedding with Yiyi.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
These years, I've been busy working,

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,920
always on the road.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,280
Never had the chance

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,760
to prepare a unique wedding for her.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,720
So,

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm very happy today

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,200
that you can witness our love.

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,480
Thank you.

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,760
Shaofei.

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Xue Fanyu.

67
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,720
What exactly do you want?

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
If you keep messing around,

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,520
not only will you end up in jail,

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,760
but my company will be implicated.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,600
You remain unchanged.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Still that selfish and cold-blooded.

73
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:25,760
(Three Years Ago)

74
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
Without my permission,

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
you can't come back.

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,480
Now the groom may kiss the bride.

I like it as well.

88
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,920
Glad Ms. Yang likes it.

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,000
It's Beethoven's

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Moonlight Sonata.

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,080
You need to teach me more.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,040
Then I'll remember it.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,480
Ms. Yang.

94
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Behave yourself.

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Shaofei.

96
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Do you know

97
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,920
the best way to forget a woman

98
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,480
is to accept a new

99
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
and better one.

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
Let's make a bet

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,280
on how long

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,880
I'll make you forget her.

103
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,800
Love isn't a bet.

104
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Ms. Yang.

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
You are Song's superior.

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,960
I wanna see her once more.

107
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
Can I?

108
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,200
Sure.

109
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,920
If you teach me playing piano,

110
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,320
I'll give you

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,000
whatever you want.

112
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,360
Xue Fanyu,

113
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
I've done

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,480
all the acting with you.

115
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm leaving.

116
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,000
Such a day worthy of celebration.

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
Shouldn't we drink to it?

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,960
Look at what you've done.

119
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Have you considered Mr. Meng's feelings?

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Since you insist on staying,

121
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,840
you can only stay by my side.

122
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
I won't be like this ring,

123
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,080
manipulated by others.

124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
Miss Song,

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
you took him wrong.

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,480
No one would joke about marriage

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,680
and his own reputation.

128
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,280
(From today on,)

129
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,280

(Six Years Ago)

131
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,280
Do you like here?

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,920
My mom used to

133
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,480
plant many roses with me.

134
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Pitifully,

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,480
they were all destroyed by him.

136
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,640
Piss off.

137
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,800
Will

138
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,800
you leave me?

139
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,240
I will be with you

140
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
planting lots and lots of roses.

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,200
(The greenhouse remains unchanged.)

142
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,040
Alright. It's okay.

143
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
It's okay now.

144
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,520

Not exactly.
