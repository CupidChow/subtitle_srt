What's up?

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Angry?

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
You promised me you'd leave Song alone.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,000
But then you framed us.

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,320
I was helping you!

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Once what's done is done,

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,120
are you still worried she'll leave you?

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
The means is so despicable.

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,760
I know your plan.

35
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,040
Master is checking your accounts.

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
You want to divert attention.

37
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,640
Well.

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,400
I can't just sit around and wait to die.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,480
Shaofei.

40
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,800
Give me some idea.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay?

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
You overestimate me.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,680
After all,

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm not as good as Master.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,560
Then,

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,120
I'll have to figure out a way myself.

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,000
(Dr. Song Tong fell to his death.
Suicide or murder?)

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,160
Mr. Xue.

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,280
Are you sure you wanna
keep Miss Song at the company?

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,720
Her stalking incident three years ago
remains unresolved.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,160
What if...

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,120
It won't.

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,760
This time I will definitely not let her

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,880
end up the same way.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,920
So, Xue confines me here

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,960
to keep me from Yang Nana.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,480
Then I misunderstood him.

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,600
If so,

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,440
should I apologize to him?

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
But how?

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
(Alcohol emboldens the cowardly.)

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,680
(Go for it.)

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,160
I need to talk to you.

64
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Recite.

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,000
Huh?

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360
Newton's second law.

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
What does that mean?

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,640
You don't even know such basics.

69
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,080
Your exam is tomorrow.

70
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
What are you gonna do?

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,400
Xue.

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
Are you drunk?

73
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Solve this problem

74
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
before you go to sleep.

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,440
45-minute countdown.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,640
Start.

77
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,560
The first question already got me.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
Look.

79
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,800
A polar bear fell into

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,840
a five-meter deep trap.

81
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,040
It took just one second

82
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,720
for it to fall down.

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
One second.

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,440
So fast.

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,400
Then the question is

86
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,240
what kind of bear

87
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,640
is it?

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,480
Don't know.

89
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Polar bear.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
I've told you already.

91
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,480
It's empty.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll go

93
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,080
to the Arctic to get more.

94
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,440
Your physics is awful.

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,480
I have to find a tutor

96
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
I water the flowers.

123
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,200
Not too much.

124
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't drown them.

125

Mr. Xue.

126
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,880
The situation of Yang Nana's
Lingxiao Restaurant

127
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
has been clarified.

128
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,080
Got it.

129
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,240
Hey, Mr. Xue.

130
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
Why cut the flowers bald today?

131
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,800
They look great this way.

132
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Super great.

133
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Wow.

134
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm leaving.

135
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,080
See you.

136
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,440
Okay.

137
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,520
Got it.

138
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,600
That Xue Fanyu.

139
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
Just some kickbacks.

140
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
He dared report me.

141
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,400
All my assets are now frozen.

142
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Ms. Yang.

143
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,080
Don't be mad.

144
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,560
After all, I'm his lawful stepmother.

145
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,080
How dare he?

146
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
When exactly

147
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,520
can I stop being dominated by him?

148
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,800
Ms. Yang.

149
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,600
Maybe just let it go.

150
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,200
You can't beat him.

151
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
Unless...

152
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,240
Unless what?

153
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,640
You can do something

154
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,440
more meaningful for the company.

155
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
More meaningful?

156
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
Something more meaningful...

157
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Peerless Rose.

158
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
Peerless Rose?

159
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,920
Peerless Rose is the secret research
of Dr. Song Tong.

160
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,960
It can trigger the unique scent
in each person.

161
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
A million people, a million scents.

162
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,680
Unique for everyone.

163

164
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,320

Xue Fanyu can no longer match me.

167
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,920
I've heard of it.

168
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,640
Wasn't this project halted?

169
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,840
And without Master's consent,

170
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,560
it's hardly possible, right?

171
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
I got it!

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,920
