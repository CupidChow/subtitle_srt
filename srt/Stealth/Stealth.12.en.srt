Ms. Wu has advanced
the evaluation to tomorrow.

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,800
Got it.

Evaluation's advanced.

Get ready.

57
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,760
(I heard Ms. Wu will be
in charge of this evaluation.)

58
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,640
(Isn't she usually overseas?)

59
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,240
(What brought her back so suddenly?)

60
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Ms. Wu is here.

61
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,360
Is this the sample for the evaluation?

smell better than this.

64
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,760
to Yulin Group's standards?

65
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,960
Today's evaluation results

66
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,040
are all invalid.

67
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,760
But you haven't even

68
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
smelled the others yet.

69
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,400
Who is this?

70
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,520
Well, this is Fanyu's...

71
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
Never mind.

72
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,840
Right.

73
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,600
But it's not fair to the others.

74
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Fair or not,

75
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
I make the call.

76
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
Rubbish

77
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,280
should stay in the rubbish bin.

78
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
How can you

79
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,400
deny the efforts of all of us?

80
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,320
Who do you think you are?

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,320
Xue.

82
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,320
You're so careless!

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
Someone who is so clumsy

84
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
isn't really cut out for here.

85
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
Since Fanyu's spoken up,

86
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,080
you might stay.

87
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,400
Mr. Xue.

88
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,640
I've checked it.

89
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,240
Because of the engagement, Ms. Wu...

90
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm married now.

91
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
She should give up.

92
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,200
But,

93
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,680
how do we explain to Mr. Wu?

94
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,960
Mr. Wu collaborates with us

95
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,760
not because of the engagement.

96
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm just concerned that Yiyi will...

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Mr. Xue.

98
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,640

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,760

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,400
You can

105
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,960
just ask me.

106
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,240

has always been pleasant.

But if we were family,

After all,

154
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,280
