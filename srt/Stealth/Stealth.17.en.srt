Ms. Liang.

Take a seat.

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,920
Hi.

00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,840
Hi.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
Thank you.

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,440
Song,

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
latte for you.

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Okay.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
She's lactose intolerant.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,520
Song.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,400
Fighting with your uncle again?

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,680
Mr. Xue has been contributing

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,040
to the school all these years.

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
So this time,

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
I'd like to invite you all for a meal.

42
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,520
Song's boyfriend is also here.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,960
You know each other?

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Mr. Xue

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,280
is my Master.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,640
That's great.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,840
This deepens our bond.

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
Not really, Ms. Liang.

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
He

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
is not my uncle anymore.

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
We have

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
no blood relation.

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,080
Song.

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,320
Why fighting with your uncle again?

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,480
You really need to work on your temper.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,080
Ms. Liang, I'll use the restroom.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
- Song.
- Excuse me.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,040
Are you okay? Let me...

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,680
Let go.

60
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,800
What's it?

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,280
For a man,

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,560
is it worth it?

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,800
None of your business.

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
We are divorced.

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
Even so,

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm still your family.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
You know it clearly

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,280
that we have no blood connection.

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,440
What?

00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,000

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,160

fancies someone else,

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840

We're no longer related.

You're not even my uncle anymore.

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
We'll

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,120
