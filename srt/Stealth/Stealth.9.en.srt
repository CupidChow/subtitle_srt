Let's call it a day.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Meeting adjourned.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,040
Fanyu.

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,840
From now on, this project

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
relies on you.

30
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,120
(What mom left me)

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,840
(should still be inside.)

32
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
(I can't just wait for the evaluation.)

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,480
(I don't know how to face Xue at home.)

34
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,160
What is it exactly?

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,800
Just say it.

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Ms. Yang.

37
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,560
Such a big project.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,600
How could you entrust Xue Fanyu with it?

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
It is meant for Xue Fanyu.

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
Why is that?

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,280
The person in charge of this project
is Mr. Liu.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,880
Xue Fanyu offended him before.

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,760
I've talked to Mr. Liu.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,520
He won't give the green light.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,600
Ah.

46
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
That's clever!

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
I have never thought of it.

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,960
Such a big project.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
If Xue Fanyu messed it up,

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,880
that'd be mortifying.

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,600
By then,

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,960
he has to be fired.

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,040
Right.

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Fire him.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
So wise, Ms. Yang.

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
Just fire him.

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,880
Fire him.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,080
(Xue.)

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
(Since I've slept with you,)

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
(I'll help you this time)

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,720
(to compensate you.)

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Mr. Liu.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,120
This is the project update.

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
So this contract...

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,760
Why say this to me?

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,200
Xue Fanyu isn't here.

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
As an assistant, can you

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,440
make the decision?

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,480
Mr. Liu.

70
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,280
Whatever Xue Fanyu can do,

71
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,400
I can do it as well.

72
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,440
Mr. Liu.

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,120
What does this mean?

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,880
What does this mean?

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Wanna sign the contract?

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,120
Get happy first.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,640
Right?

78
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,320
How to get happy?

79
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
Just drink!

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
No drink, no happiness.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,160
Drink brings happiness.

82
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
The contract will be signed.

83
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,440
Mr. Liu, you really
have a sense of humor.

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, forget it.

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,520
Let's wait for Xue Fanyu.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
Come on, Mr. Liu.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Cheers to you.

88
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,040
Go ahead.

89
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,600
Xue.

90
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,640
Mr. Liu.

91
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,600
She is a fresh hand.

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
This is still

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,320
to be discussed between us.

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,120
Fine.

95
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,320
Since Mr. Xue is here,

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,800
let's discuss the contract in detail.

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,120
Yiyi.

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,920
Have you talked

99
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,640
to Mr. Liu about dividends?

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,480
No worry.

101
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
Your assistant covered everything.

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
I would say,

103
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
two percent is not enough.

104
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
I want five percent.

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
This leaves us no profit.

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
No problem.

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,680
Mr. Liu, you are my old friend.

108
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,360
We will have long-term collaboration,

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,920
right?

110
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,880
Alright.

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
Then let's sign it.

112
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,640
Mr. Liu.

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,400
Here you are.

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,760
Look.

115
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,600
Here is the pen.

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,160
Mr. Xue.

117
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
Sorry.

118
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,720
What should we do now?

119
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, it's fine.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
I've another one.

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480
No need.

122
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,480
I think that pen is quite good.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
Mr. Xue.

124
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Could you pick it up for me

125
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,680
by hand?

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,480
You never

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,560
intended to sign the contract
from the start, did you?

128
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Mr. Xue.

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,640
Will you sign it or not?

130
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
If anything happens to us today,

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,240
you'll never leave here, I promise.

132
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
Let's go.

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,560
I messed up the contract.

135
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,040
You didn't really think
the contract would be signed, did you?

136
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,720
Mr. Liu is not the problem.

137
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,320
He's merely used.

138
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,640
I've talked to Mr. Liu.

139
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,840
He won't give the green light.

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
So don't blame yourself so much.

141
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
Got it, Xue.

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,520
I'll be always responsible for you.

143
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,400
Don't worry.

144
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll leave then.

145
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Hello?

146
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,160
The issue with Mr. Liu is settled.

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,240
As she disregards the warning,

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,240
she needs to pay for her actions.

149
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,800
She'll be responsible for what?
