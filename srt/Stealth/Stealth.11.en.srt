Master, where's Song?

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,840
Do you know Yang Nana wanted
to restart the Peerless Rose?

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,480
She mentioned it.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
I tried to talk her out of it.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,960
She just...

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,520
What about you?

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Do you want to restart it as well?

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,120
How could I?

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
Master, you personally halted it.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,080
That's good then.

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,840
I personally halted the project.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
Never handle it.

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,360
The general manager
of the Yangshan branch

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,720
is leaving due to health issues.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,800
You should go over there.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,360
Great opportunity to gain experience.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
Once you're there,

42
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,160
cut off contact with Yiyi.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,280
Otherwise,

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,800
you'll

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,760
let your family down.

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,840
(Family.)

47
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,440
Mr. Xue.

48
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,280
Yang Nana is handed over to the police.

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
Anything else found in the car

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
besides the hard drive?

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,080
No.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,160
Mr. Xue.

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,040
Could the person who threatened you
3 years ago

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,120
be Yang Nana?

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,840
It shouldn't be her.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,360
She has no idea of these photos.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,440
Should I remind Miss Song?

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
Of what?

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm leaving.

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,840
Mr. Xue.

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,600
Yang Nana embezzled funds
of the corporate,

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
and took bribes.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,240
Now she's taken away by the police.

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,120
Fortunately, to seek leniency,

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,720
she let go of what you've done before.

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,760
This issue is settled.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
You have your freedom now.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
Are you asking me to leave?

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,600
Isn't it what you want?

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,760
Well,

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,320
should I give this back?

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
I've given it to you.

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,000
You decide.

74
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
(Will she want to stay?)

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,600
(The person who threatened me with Yiyi)

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,640
(is still a mystery.)

77
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,400
(It's best to keep her away from me.)

78
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:27,320
(Three Years Ago)

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,680
As long as you hand over
the Peerless Rose,

80
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll leave her untouched.

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
Xue.

82
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,640
Didn't you say
I should go and see the world?

83
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,040
Join me for a graduation trip abroad.

84
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Listen,

85
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
I've made the travel guide.

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,640
Look.

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Sign it.

88
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,520

89

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
These are my mom's shares.

93
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,480
Sign it.

94
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Why should I sign it?

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,840
You needn't know.

96
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,800
Whether you sign it or not,

97
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,480
it'll turn out the same.

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,720
Uncle.

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,480
Don't send me away.

100
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay?

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,600
Don't.

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,880
Uncle.

103
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't.

104
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
Without my permission,

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
you are not allowed
to return from abroad.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
Uncle, don't send me away.

107
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,240
Don't send me away.

108
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,440
You take care of me

109
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,040
just to get my mom's shares?

110
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,720
Xue Fanyu.

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,400
I hate you.

112
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,360
Is this the watch I gave you before?

113
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,960
I'm just looking.

114
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
Why haven't you left yet?

115
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
That night we...

116
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
That night we did nothing.

117
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
Oh.

118
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,640
Then how do you explain this?

119
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,160
The plane tickets
you tore up 3 years ago.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,720
Why do you still keep them?

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
I know everything.

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
You know what?

123
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
(Share Transfer Agreement)
What's this?

124
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,200
Back then, Yang Nana was going after
everyone in the company,

125
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,240
trying to take back their shares,

126
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,680
all to get at Mr. Xue.

127
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,160
He took your shares in his name

128
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,680
to protect you.

129
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
So he sent me abroad

130
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,760
because of Yang Nana.

131
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,840
Now the matter has been resolved.

132
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Mr. Xue only asked me
to give you the contract.

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,160
But I think

134
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
you should know these.

135
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
I know

136
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,320
why you asked me to leave,

137
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,840
misunderstand you,

138
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,840
dislike you,

139
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,680
and hate you.

140
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,120
It's because

141
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,280
you're scared you'll fall for me.

142
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,560
