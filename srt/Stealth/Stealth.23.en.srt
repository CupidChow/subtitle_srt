00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
How about

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,280
I come with you to the company?

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,840
Let's get the agreement done.

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
You've just recovered.

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
Stay at home and rest.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
Alright then.

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,920
Be safe.

(Two passports?)

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,400
What are you doing?

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Xue Fanyu's phone

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,040
keeps ringing.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,960
Someone is calling again.

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
What should we do?

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,280
It's still ringing.

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,400
Answer it.

43
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,040
Why aren't you answering?

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
Hello, who is this?

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, Mr. Zhao.

46
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,400
Xue isn't feeling well recently.

47
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,080
Hmm.

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,360
Bye.

50
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,640
It's okay.

51
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,000
Song.

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,720
You're doing great.

53
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,840
Shaofei.

54
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,680
Let's

55
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,480
cheers.

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
To our victory.

57
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,400
Shaofei.

58
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
I feel a bit stifled.

59
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
Wanna go out for a walk.

60
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,680
Song.

61
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,440
I want you to remain

62
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,680
the CEO's wife of the Yulin Group.

63
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,440
Shaofei.

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,320
You agreed to give me more time.

65
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,400
Song.

66
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,160
I kept letting you use me,

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,680
hoping you'd finally leave that jerk.

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,680
I really like you.

69
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
You let me down greatly.

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
Song.

71
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
You shouldn't have betrayed me.

72
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,480
Mr. Xue, what happened?

73
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,160
Injured?

74
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you alright?

75
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm fine.

76
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Where is Yiyi?

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,200
That day Miss Song went to the warehouse

78
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,040
and saw Meng Shaofei snatched her bag.

79
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,480
She then suspected
Meng Shaofei killed her mom,

80
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,800
asking for my help.

81
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
Song.

82
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Shaofei.

83
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,680
You even let her

84
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
do such risky things?

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Calm down.

86
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
Mr. Xue.

87
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,280
Miss Song found something.

88
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Six years ago,
Meng Shaofei never skipped class.

89
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,960
He found an Asian doppelgänger

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,520
to attend classes in his place.

91
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,200
She also found out

92
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,480
Meng Shaofei has two passports.

93
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,360
He returned to China

94
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,680
earlier than we expected.

95
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,840
It was before Dr. Song's death.

96
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
We were all misled.

97
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,640
It's Miss Song.

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,600
Yiyi.

99
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,840
Brother, it's me.

100
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,760
Where is Yiyi?

101
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,640
If you want to see her,

102
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,480
come to the company's rooftop alone.

103
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
You're awake?

104
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,480
Calm.

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,160
Xue Fanyu

106
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,760
is about to be finished soon.

107
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Why are you laughing?

108
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,280
You used Yang Nana as a front,

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,920
Wu Di as a shield,

110
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,800
and then me to control Xue Fanyu.

111
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,880
You've always hidden behind women.

112
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Now,

113
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,400
the rat's finally come out
into the open.

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,840
You actually think that of me?

115
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
When did you start suspecting me?

116
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
Your mom's diary.

117
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
At first,

118
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,440
I just felt your particular attention
to my mom's stuff.

119
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Song.

120
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,520
Shaofei.

121
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,040
Why are you here?

122
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,640
I finished the work.

123
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,080
Came to keep you company.

124
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm here to pick something up.

125
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,760
I'll accompany you.

126
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
Later on,

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
I found you're not what I thought.

128
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,440
So I started to investigate you.

129
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,440
You've already got the company.

130
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,560
I just have one question.

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
Did you

132
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,040
kill my mom?

133
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,480
You'll know the answer soon.

134
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,160
Don't be scared.

135
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,440
I'll take you away.

136
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
Brother.

137
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,480
I've been waiting for you for ages.

138
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
Get up.

139
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
Turn around.

140
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,720
Back off.

141
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,160
Hurry up.

142
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,680
I said hurry up!

143
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,920
I've given you the Yulin Group.

144
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,280
What else do you want?

145
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,440
I

146
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
want your life.

147
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,560
Leave here.

148
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,240
Quiet.

149
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,960
What should I do?

150
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,160
Your suicide note is ready.

151
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,640
Will it be that Song died by accident?

152
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Or you

153
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,000
committed suicide out of guilt

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
for killing Dr. Song?

155
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
Fanyu, leave here!

156
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,040
Be quiet!

157
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,920
Ok, fine.

158
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,360
I'll do it.

159
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,080
Then hurry up.

160
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,120
If you dare to hurt her,

161
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,720
I'll never forgive you, even in death.

162
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,280
Xue Fanyu.

163
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
Go to hell.

164
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,280
Six years ago, that night,
it was you, right?

165
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
So what if it was?

166
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,520
After tonight, no one will know.

167
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,680
- Let go.
- Back off.

168
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,080
Xue.

169
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,480
Xue.

170
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,200
Miss Song.

171
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,000
You're awake.

172
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,480
Bai Chun.

173
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Where's Xue?

174
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,440
Where is he now?

175
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,280
Is he alright?

176
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Mr. Xue left you

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,360
all the company shares

178
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,480
(Property Ownership; Divorce Agreement)
and the villa.

179
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,880
What's that supposed to mean?

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
Also this.

181
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Mr. Xue is very sorry

182
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,680
for making you suffer all this.

183
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,200
No matter what you say,

184
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
he cannot forgive himself.

185
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,160
So, Mr. Xue says

186
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,120
he won't bother you again.

187
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm sorry, Miss Song.

188
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,160
(The flowers have been watered.)

189
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,400
(Mr. Xue has been here?)

190
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,120
Xue...

191
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,960
Miss Song.

192
