What are you doing?

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,760
Shaofei?

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,920
When did you return?

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,200
Give it to me.

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,520
This is top secrets.

32
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,480
I can't give it to you.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,280
Give it to me.

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,920
Be quick!

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,240
Shaofei, what do you want?

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Give it to me.

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Give it to me.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
Give it to me.

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
- Give it to me!
- Mr. Xue.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
Here.

41
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,560
Mr. Xue.

42
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,680
Mr. Xue.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,080
Are you alright, Mr. Xue?

44
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,600
(That day,)

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,320
(Mr. Xue announced the successful
development of the Peerless Rose.)

46
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,520
(Just as we were about
to catch the mole,)

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,040
(Dr. Song unexpectedly
returned to the lab.)

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
(Meng Shaofei had been planning)

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,560
(to steal company samples
for a competitor all along.)

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,400
(Dr. Song happened to see it)

51
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,760
(and accidentally fell.)

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,200
(Now Meng Shaofei's been arrested)

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,560
(for stealing trade secrets.)

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,520
(Xue Fanyu never used my mom at all.)

55
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,816
(One Year Later)

56
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Ms. Song.

57
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Go ahead.

58
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Ms. Shen said

59
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,920
she's still considering working with us

60
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,200
or with other shareholders.

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
The bigwigs at the company

62
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
definitely don't want me
hogging this whole thing.

63
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,960
Xue

64
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,640
has been missing for over a year.

65
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
Has he contacted you?

66
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,520
Oh, nope.

67
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Well,

68
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,840
if it were Xue,

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,400
what would he do?

70
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,600
Mr. Xue says

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
he's really confident in you, Miss Song.

72
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
Thinks you're ready to run the show.

73
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
Says?

74
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
When?

75
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,040
Probably...

76
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,240
Hello, Mr. Xue.

77
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,440
Miss Song...

78
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,360
I've said

79
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,400
I won't meet her.

80
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,920
Miss Song is in trouble.

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,440
Someone kidnapped Miss Song

82
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
to get Ms. Shen's project.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,760
Yiyi.

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Yiyi.

85
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,920
Yiyi.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Song Yiyi.

87
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,160
Where are you exactly?

88
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,280
Xue Fanyu.

89
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,160
You've disappeared for an entire year.

90
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,040
Feeling any better?

91
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
We should not bear

92
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,480
the grudges of the previous generation.

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,800
So,

94
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,280
don't atone for others' mistakes.

95
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,160
You've been gone for so long.

96
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Punishing yourself?

97
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,800
No. You're punishing me.

98
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,400
I know.

99
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,400
You're doing it for my sake.

100
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
So I don't blame you.

101
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
This time,

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
I won't let you escape again.

103
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Marry me once more.

104
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,880
I chose this DR diamond ring

105
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
because it's for only one person
in a lifetime.

106
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,040
So DR epitomizes lifelong love.

107
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,840
And you

108
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,160
are the person I want to protect

109
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,600
with all my life.

110
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,240
I've decided.

111
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,720
You're my forever one.

112
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Yiyi, what's this scent?

113
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,400
The Peerless Rose cannot be released

114
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,680
because it involves
considerable user privacy.

115
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,480
But this

116
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,360
is your exclusive scent.

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,360
My exclusive scent?

118
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,640
Xue.

119
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,480
When did you start to like me?

120
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,360
Mr. Xue.

121
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,520
Return to the company.

122
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,600
It's chaos without a leader now.

123
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,840
Her death is not your fault.

124
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,560
You can't give up yourself like this.

125
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,920
Mr. Xue.

126
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,720
Uncle.

127
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
I'll get the car, Mr. Xue.

128
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
The rose you gave me is growing.

129
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,200
These are its seeds.

130
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,360
If you are feeling unhappy,

131
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,680
just plant flowers.

132
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,960
It can cheer you up.

133
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
(Later,)

134
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800

135
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,120
