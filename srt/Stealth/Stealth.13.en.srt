Xue.

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,280
Uncle.

28
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Don't be mad.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,040
Have an ice cream to cool off.

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
Why make such a joke?

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,600
Why did you avoid me?

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,520
I checked with Bai Chun.

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
Your meeting ended ages ago.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,240
Come on, don't be mad.

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
Since you're here,

36
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,160
hang out with me.

37
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,720
Let's go.

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,480
Remember

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
that you used to wait for me here?

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm wondering.

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm not bad-looking.

42
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
I got good grades.

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
Why nobody asked me out?

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,600
Tell me.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,480
Why did you scare them off?

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,000
You were so young.

47
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,640
You should focus on your study.

48
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,400
Is that so?

49
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Hey.

50
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,240
My basketball.

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Thanks.

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,040
Spotted you afar.

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
Can I add your WeChat?

54
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Uncle.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
Can he?

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,880
He is so young.

57
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,240
He should also focus on his study.

58
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,480
Okay.

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,720
Uncle.

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm already eighteen.

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,640
Secured university offer already.

62
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
I can ask girls out.

63
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Alright.

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,480
Beat me.

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
Then you can add her.

66
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,880
Deal.

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,440
Won.

68
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Xue, you're awesome.

69
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,200
That was fantastic.

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,280
Oh my, that's awesome.

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
Xue.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
How didn't I notice

73
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
that you're so good at basketball.

74
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
That move you just did

75
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,720
hit right on.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,760
Fabulous.

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,640
So Fabulous!

78
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,600
Nothing special.

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,160
Really?

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,280
What are you two doing?

81
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,840
It's Destroy Nun.

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
Hurry.

83
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,200
Stop there.

84
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,120
Stop.

85
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,080
Puppy love, huh?

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,400
Stop there.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,600
Go, go, go.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
Xue.

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
Why should we run?

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,040
You ran first.

91
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
Are you feeling guilty?

92
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,040
Is it because you think

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
there's something shameful

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
about our relationship?

95
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Listen.

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
This place

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,600
is the secret base for young lovers.

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
They

99
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
are just like us.

100
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
On the sly.

101
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Silly.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Xue.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,280
Your heart is racing.

104
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Heart

105
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,400
won't lie.

106
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,040
Xue.

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,600
You like me.

108
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,760
Stop it.

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,440
Do you really forget?

110
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,360
Three years ago,
I buried something here.

111
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
Find it.

112
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,360
Or I'm not leaving.

113
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,280
