25

All about me.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
We met when I was a kid!

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,320
When was that?

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
Back then,

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,040
I delivered documents to your mom.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
There was this kid

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
holding onto me

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,840
and asking me about her homework.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,560
Alright.

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
So this is not the Peerless Rose.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,320
But the footage of my growth.

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,520
It's a birthday gift from my mom.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,320
Your mom loves you

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
so, so much.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
So do I.

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
Let's go to a place tomorrow.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
Okay.

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
What made you want to come here?

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,880
This is my mom's favorite place.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,920
Isn't it beautiful?

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,680
Mom.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,880
I'm finally with the person I like.

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,120
His name is Xue Fanyu.

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
He said

49
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,120
he would plant lots of roses with me.

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,560
Mr. Xue.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
Meng Shaofei wants to talk to you.

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,200
Put him on the phone.

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Brother.

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,360
Shoot.

55
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,120
Song's so joyful with you.

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,040
Seems like

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,320
she's still unaware
of what you did to her mom,

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
your senior sister.

59
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,560
Xue.

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,920
What's up?

61
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,760
Xue.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,920
Xue, what's wrong with you?

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Find my medicine.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Medicine?

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,920
Where is the medicine?

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
On the right.

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,760
Here.

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,400
How do you feel?

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,320
Any better?

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm fine.

71
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,676
(Imipramine Hydrochloride Tablets)

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,160
Why do you use psych meds?

73
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,040
So

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,520
you got the dizziness and tinnitus

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,840
as a result of

76
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,880
seeing my mom fall to her death?

77
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
That's why

78
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
I've noticed you acting very strange
several times.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,680
I thought

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
you just had a headache.

81
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,360
Why didn't you tell me?

82
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I don't feel comfortable
talking about my issues.

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,760
Even with me?

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,360
You're not keeping anything else
from me, are you?

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,840
You are!

86
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
What is it?

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,920
Spill it.

88
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
Actually, Meng Shaofei

89
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
is my half-brother.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
What?

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,600
My dad had quite a few
youthful romances.

92
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,040
That's why.

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
I feel that

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,680
we should not bear

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,360
the grudges of the previous generation.

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,880
You always protected me before.

97
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
From now on,

98
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,600
my turn to protect you.

99
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,040
Mr. Xue.

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,080
Miss Song.

101
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
I have something to attend to
with Bai Chun.

102
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,640
You go home first.

103
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
What do you know

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,200
about what happened six years ago?

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
Spill it.

106
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,520
Xue Fanyu.

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,200
How dare you question me here?

108
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,600
Mr. Xue.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,160
(Six Years Ago)
You banned core data uploads.

110
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,080
Just some basic data leaked.

111
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,480
But no viruses.

112
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,640
No hackers.

113
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
It must be someone from us.

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,880
Shall we cut off the server first?

115
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
No.

116
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
Do not cut it off.

117
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,880
Keep inputting new data.

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Since it's phishing,

119
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,080
don't put too much effort into it.

120
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,960
Use that...

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,720
The terminated secret research.

122
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,840
You mean

123
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,520
Dr. Song's Peerless Rose project?

124
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,280
Yes.

125
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Mr. Xue.

126
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
Here.

127
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
Back then,

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
you used the Peerless Rose project

129
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,880
and sent Song Tong to find the mole,

130
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,160
which led to her tragic death.

131
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,720
Xue Fanyu.

132
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,320
You killed your senior sister,

133
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,520
the mother of Song Yiyi.

134
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm wondering,

135
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,120
if Song Yiyi finds out about all this,

136
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,600
will she still be with you?

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,360
Shut up!

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,720
Just give me the company's shares.

139
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,360
I'll stay silent about it all.

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,920
Have you lost your mind?

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,520
Why think you can negotiate with me?

142
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,200
Bai Chun.

143
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,600
Watch him closely.

144
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,720
Xue Fanyu.

145
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,520
You'll regret this.

146
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,680
You'll regret this!

147
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,480
You are back, huh?

148
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,480
Is it all done?

149
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,520
What happened?

150
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,040
Will you always believe me

151
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
no matter what happens?

152
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,000
You bet.

153
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560

Let's

179
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,560
go somewhere where no one knows us.

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,800
Okay.

181
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,960
Aren't you curious why?

182
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,040
I owed you the graduation trip.

183
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,760
And the honeymoon.

184
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,960
This time, I'll make up

185
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,360
for all that I owe you,

186
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,120
okay?

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,320
How can a big boss like you

188
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,760
be away from the company for so long?

189
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
Don't worry.

190
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,640
I've arranged everything.

191
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,880
Really?

192
