This is your place, Chair Wu.

26

Expecting our fruitful collaboration.

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Definitely.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Where is Yiyi?

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,080
We have guests here.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,200
Sorry.

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
I did nothing to her.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,200
I gave her five million.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,080
Where is she exactly?

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Fanyu.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I resolved a big issue for you,

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,760
to ensure our successful collaboration.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,480
Let me ask you one more time.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Where is

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,760
Song Yiyi?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,240
Don't push the line.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,680
What can you do to me?

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
Look,

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,000
your company's lifeline is in my grip.

44
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,680
I gave you the chance.

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,840
These are the gray proceeds

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Wu Corporation's gained over the years.

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Xue Fanyu.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Have you lost your mind?

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,600
You also hold a stake here.

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,640
I want nothing now.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,960
Xue Fanyu. Xue Fanyu.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,160
Ms. Wu, please cooperate.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,360
Hello?

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,040
Mr. Xue.

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
Miss Song is back home.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,840
Okay, I got it.

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,600
Yiyi, last night I...

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,640
Xue Fanyu.

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,720
In the eyes of you and Wu Di,

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
am I an eyesore?

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
Just like

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,200
this blue rose

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
you hid away.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,320
No. She and I...

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,280
What?

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
Can't explain it?

67
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,440
Fine.

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,480
Then you don't deserve

69
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,880
this.

70
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,920
We should

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,400
get a divorce.

72
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
From today on,

73
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
I am your uncle.

74
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,520
This room brings back

75
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,240
many memories, huh?

76
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,000
Not good ones.

77
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,960
Probably too old.

78
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,760
It's tripped.

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,320
Song,

80
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,280
let me do it?

81
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,000
No need.

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,040
I took care of this stuff on my own.

83
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Shine your light here.

84
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
Song.

85
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,600
The scent on you is quite unique.

86
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,240
My mom left me this.

87
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,000
Who are you?

88
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,200
What are you doing?

89
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Ms. Liang?

90
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,400
Song Yiyi?

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
Miss Song is home safely.

92
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,200
About Wu Di,

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,920
the police are investigating
her various offenses.

94
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
Even for divorce,

95
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
is the current situation

96
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,640
what you want?

97
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,520
I nearly mistook you
for thieves last night.

98
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
Ah, Song,

99
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,920
your boyfriend?

100
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,200
Good taste.

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
Oh, no, Ms. Liang.

102
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,760
We...

103
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
If your mom were to see this,

104
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
she'd surely be happy.

105
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
There's someone

106
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
you probably haven't seen for ages.

107
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
Who is it?

108
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,520
