Yiyi.

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,480
Your mom passed away.

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,040
I, your uncle, is your sole kin.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,200
Listen to me.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Sell this house.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,320
So we'll have cash.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,360
Think about it.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,640
Your mom is gone.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,560
You'll rely on me

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,040
for the rest of your life.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,880
Get the house certificate.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,080
Stop dithering.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm being nice.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,600
Don't test me.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,120
She's dead.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,200
Still occupying this house?

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,120
Want me on the street?

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,120
Piss off.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,160
Denying me peace, even in death.

(Property Ownership Certificate)

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Your mom wouldn't
want to see you like this.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,840
Look at you.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
Wanna fight me?

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,480
Who are you?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,720
A person like you

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
isn't qualified to be her uncle.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,720
You just wait.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,440
Your mother was my senior.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,640
From today on,

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,640
I am your uncle.

Mr. Wang.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,320
Does my job application stand a chance?

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
Oh.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,440
I've seen your resume

many times.

51

But Yulin Group

isn't a place where anyone can get in.

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,160
After all,

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,680
to get things done well,

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
you must first be a nice person.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,240
Mr. Wang.

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm not that kind of person.

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,200
I know you're not.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,680

Don't move.

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,360
Let go.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,200
Give it to me.

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,480

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
How careless I am.

80
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,400
This grass must be precious.

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll pay you.

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
No need.

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
Since you're here,

84
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,480
have a cup of tea before you go.

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Also,

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,720
I was looking for you.

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Alright.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,280
Is that your friend?

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,440
No, no.

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,200
Don't mind her.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,480

Mr. Xue.

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,920
We've nothing to do with each other now.

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
Long time no see.

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
Forget my name?

99
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,160
Don't come over.

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
Six years ago,

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,120
you pretended to adopt me,
gaining my trust.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,920
(Share Transfer Agreement)
3 years later, you took my mom's shares

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
and sent me abroad.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,480
You've got what you wanted.

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
What else do you want?

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,520
Whatever your intentions are,
I don't care.

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,640
I'll send you away as soon as possible.

108
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,280
Listen.

109
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm not going anywhere.

110
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't think about controlling me again.

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,320
Xue Fanyu.

112
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,640
Haven't you had enough

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,120
of this farce of playing family?

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Mr. Xue.

115
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,880
Time to change Mr. Wang's tea.

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,560
Keep an eye on her.

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,240
You betrayed the company, right?

118
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,880
Ho-How could I?

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
So it was Ms. Yang's instructions.

120
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,840
No, no, no.

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,560
It's not...

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Not Ms. Yang?

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Then it can only be you.

124
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,960
Well, I...

125
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,440
No rush.

126
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,360
Mr. Wang.

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
Have a sip of tea first.

128
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Take your time.

129
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
I...

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,600
Yes, it's

131
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,760
Ms. Yang's instructions.

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
Thank you for your cooperation.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,760
By the way,

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,560
which hand of yours
touched that girl just now?

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,760
Mr. Meng.

136
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,760
Here is the evidence
of Mr. Wang's crimes.

137
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
Videos of him trying to assault me.

138
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Evidence of him leaking company secrets.

139
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,440
Without Mr. Wang,

140
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,880
I can then help you.

141
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Mr. Meng.

142
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,560
During my return this time,

143
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,000
I must join the Yulin Group

144
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
and get my mom's belongings
from the lab.

145
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,200
Thanks for taking me here.

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,320
Song,

147
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll always help you.

148
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,760
But promise me.

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
Don't take such risks anymore.

150
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,720
Let's go.

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,840
Isn't that Mr. Meng?

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,600
He's said to be

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,160
the candidate for the Vice President
of the Yulin Group.

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
But why is Yang Nana's perfume launch

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,760
held here?

156
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,520
She's the shareholder
of the Yulin Group.

157
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
Yulin has many businesses.

158
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
This restaurant is merely a fraction.

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
She is said to rival Mr. Xue in power.

160
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,640
Two tigers can't coexist
on a single mountain.

161
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,560
- Ms. Yang.
- Ms. Zhao.

162
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,680
- Welcome.
- Ms. Yang.

163
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,280
Shaofei.

164
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,080
This is Ms. Yang I've mentioned.

165
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,680
I'll introduce you to her in a moment.

166
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,440
Ms. Yang.

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
Mr. Li seems looking for you.

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,960
Master.

169
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,120
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

170
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
Why?

171
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,920
Shaofei.

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,640
This is?

173
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,680
This is my girl...

174
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,600
Girlfriend.

175
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,800
Girlfriend?

176
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,600
Why haven't I heard you mention her?

177
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
Because

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
I don't allow him.

179
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,600
Your girlfriend has quite a personality.

180
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,760
Because my uncle is no ordinary man.

181
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,680
How come I've never heard
you mention this before?

182
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,080
He passed away.

183
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,280
Oh, right.

184
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
I left my bag in the car.

185
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,560
I'll go get it.

186
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll go.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,440
High heels are inconvenient.

188
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,880
Sorry, sorry.

189
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,440
Don't you worry

190
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
your boyfriend will be jealous?

191
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,920
Mr. Xue.

192
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,840
Have you forgotten

193
