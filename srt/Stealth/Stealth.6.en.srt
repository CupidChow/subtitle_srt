How is it?

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,200
I prepared it specially for you.

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,400
Don't waste my good intentions.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,160
Go ahead.

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
Go.

31
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
(Let's see how you get out.)

32
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
Got what you wanted?

33
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,760
Wait.

34
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,080
You...

35
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
How did you get out?

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,360
Guess.

37
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,880
Give it back to me.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
You got a nosebleed.

39
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
No blood.

40
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,200
About to end, finally.

41
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,560
One last day to go.

42
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
I can return to work tomorrow.

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,200
Mr. Meng?

44
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
Mr. Meng.

45
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
What brings you here?

46
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
I couldn't reach you.

47
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
Master wouldn't let me in.

48
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I had no choice but...

49
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,600
About the wedding,

50
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
Back to you.

52
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,280
It's not your fault.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,480
I failed to protect you.

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,240
It's fine now.

55
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,200
I'm returning to the company tomorrow.

56
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,480
Mr. Xue.

57
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
Mr. Meng is here.

58
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,880
He's to take Miss Song away.

59
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,600
Should we...

60
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,400
Let her choose for herself.

61
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,560
You may not know yet.

62
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,600
You've been fired by Master.

63
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,240
I did my best.

64
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
But...

65
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,560
I have no authority.

66
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,200
Song.

67
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,480
Come with me.

68
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,480
I will take you away from here.

69
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,880
No need.

70
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
Some things

71
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,240
must be faced eventually.

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,760
I...

73
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,040
Besides, if you helped me,

74
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,760
you would be implicated, right?

75
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,840
Right.

76
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,320
Although I could stop it,

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,080
I got you the keys to the lab.

78
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360
Mr. Meng.

79
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,760
I truly appreciate it.

80
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
Then I'm leaving.

81
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,920
Hmm.

82
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,120
(Xue Fanyu.)

83
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
(You tricked me again.)

84
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,240
I'll go out with you today.

85
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
To the company?

86
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
Haven't you always wanted to travel?

87
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
I've bought the plane tickets.

88
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,440
I'll join you this time.

89
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Xue.

90
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
Let me tell you a story.

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,480
Once there was a king

92
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,720
who liked the canary very much.

93
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,960
So he carefully crafted a cage,

94
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,840
and locked the canary inside.

95
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,080
He took meticulous care of it every day,

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,240
but never cared whether the canary

97
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
was happy or not.

98
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
Then one day,

99
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,760
the king forgot to close the cage.

100
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
Finally,

101
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,720
the canary came out.

102
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,240
It faced the sky,

103
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,800
and took a gentle leap.

104
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,720
Guess what happened?

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
It fell to the ground and died.

106
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't like this story.

107
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,560
The king

108
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,720
kept it locked up for too long.

109
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
It forgot how to fly.

110
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,720
If the canary had just stayed

111
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
inside the cage,

112
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,320
it wouldn't have fallen to its death.

113
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
But I'm not happy!
