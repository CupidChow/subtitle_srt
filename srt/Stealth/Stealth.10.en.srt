Who are you?

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Why are you tying me up?

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,600
Ms. Yang doesn't even recognize me,

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,240
yet expects my assistance
against Xue Fanyu?

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,520
Mr. Liu?

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,600
Mr. Liu.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,760
I do owe you money.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
But after I drive Xue Fanyu out,

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
I'll have money to repay you.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,840
How long do I have to wait this time?

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,960
I transferred 5 million not long ago.

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,760
Xue Fanyu is watching me.

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,720
Mr. Liu.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,920
Why don't you just drive Xue Fanyu out?

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
I can then restart the Peerless Rose.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
You'll get my repayment with interest.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
Am I stupid to you?

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,320
You are using me against Xue Fanyu.

44
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Are you Mr. Liu?

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Who are you?

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,800
How much will you embezzle this time?

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
It's you!

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,640
Right, it's me.

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,600
Xue respects you as his stepmother,

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,760
so he bears with you

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,480
again and again.

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,160
What about you?

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
How much kickback have you taken
over the years?

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,320
Now, you're colluding with outsiders

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,720
against Xue.

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
You even planned to drive him out
of the company?

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,240
Slander demands evidence.

58
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,280
Evidence?

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
Do you think

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,920
I still care about evidence?

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
What do you want?

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,680
Do you know

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,560
that burnt protein

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,280
smells like

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,960
feathers?

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,200
Stop it.

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,040
You'll soon smell your scent.

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
Xue Fanyu is the one to blame!

69
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,080
If he hadn't been that hard on me,

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
and frozen my funds,

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,320
why'd I bother with the Peerless Rose,

72
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,800
and mess with him?

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,400
Ms. Yang admitted the embezzlement.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,480
I've been suspecting her for a while.

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,800
You've seen it.

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,840
So about the dismissal of Ms. Yang,

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,520
any objection?

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,200
No objection.

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,200
It's outrageous.

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
Look at all these!

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
So brazen!

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,520
Shareholders' meeting?

83
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Exactly.

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Eye for an eye.

85
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,400
Ms. Yang.

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,520
Wait for the corporate oversight.

87
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
You kidnapped me.

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll sue you.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,960
This is your room.

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
These are all your stuff.

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,280
Aren't they familiar?

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,920
This is

93
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,840
just a game between us.

94
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,240
No.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm not going to jail.

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,880

Miss Song, Mr. Xue asked me
to pick you up.

99
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,640
You leave. I'll take care of this.

100
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Hello, why aren't you picking me up?

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Ms. Yang, just wait a bit longer.

102
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Useless.

103
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
Ms. Yang.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Shall we have a good talk?

105
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
Why would you wanna
restart the Peerless Rose?

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
Do I have a choice?

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,760
If you hadn't reported my restaurant,

108
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,200
and frozen my assets,

109
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,120
would I resort to the Peerless Rose?
