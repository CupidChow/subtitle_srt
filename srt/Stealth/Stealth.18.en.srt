25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Master.

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,480
Why are you here?

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,760
Yesterday, Song accidentally...

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,920
Master.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
What's between you and Song
is history now.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,520
Please don't bother her anymore.

31
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,720
Shaofei.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,880
Are you alright?

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,440
Song, I'm fine.

34
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,480
Song.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,640
Soup for you.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,480
Thanks.

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,880
Well,

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,800
is your hand okay?

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,600
It's fine.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Hungry? Drink it.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Take a seat.

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
How did you get in?

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
I've changed the password.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
My fingerprint still works.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,680
Master.

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
What are you doing, Xue Fanyu?

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,360
Yiyi is allergic to shrimp.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,920
What would you like?

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll cook for you.

50
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,400
Mr. Xue.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Yang Nana confessed something new.

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,680
Is it funny?

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,080
Sorry, Mr. Xue.

54
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,320
Master.

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,920
What's it?

56
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm just curious.

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,240
Many people come and go in the company.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,320
Why do you treat Yiyi

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
differently?

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,720
Only those drenched by rain

61
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
would think about

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,000
holding an umbrella.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,520
Master.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,120
You won't get it.

65
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,200
Colluding with Yang Nana.

66
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,400
And covertly prodding Wu Di
into abducting her.

67
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,280
Your way of holding an umbrella

68
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
is quite unique indeed.

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,440
Master.

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,160
I've no idea what you're talking about.

71
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,880
Yang Nana already confessed

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,560
that it was you

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
who induced her to
restart the Peerless Rose.

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,320
It was also you

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
who put the hard drive in her car.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
You're the one who sent me Yiyi's photos

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,840
and threatened me three years ago.

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,400
Master.

79
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,000
You are just awesome.

80
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
But,

81
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
any evidence?

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
I'll tell her everything.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,240
If you can,

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
you've told her before.

85
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,640
Moreover,

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,440
can you explain clearly

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,680
the death of Song Tong to Yiyi?

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,240
How did you know about that?

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,000
You can check on me. So can I.

90
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,920
Shaofei.

91
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Come on.

92
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
Xue Fanyu, you...

93
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,600
Song, I'm fine.

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
Master simply misunderstood me.

95
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,080
I've explained it already.

96
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,520
Right?

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
Master.

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,520
Let's go.

99
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,840
Go.

100
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,720
Bai Chun.

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
Check where Meng Shaofei was

102
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,160
six years ago.

103
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Song.

104
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,480
Ms. Liang.

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
This is for you.

106
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,840
What is this?

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,760
I thought it was students' homework.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,800
But I recently found it is not.

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
Then it is?

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,840
Your mother's diary.

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,280
I didn't get to give it to you
last time.

112
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,320
Song.

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,680
I'll leave you be for now.

114
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
Okay.

115
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Take care on your return.

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,880
(I'm considering
whether to tell Yiyi this news.)

117
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,240
(Yiyi, my sweet and adorable child.)

118
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,560
(I hope I can accompany her)

119
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,840
(to grow up healthily.)

120
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,240
(She eats)

121
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,160
(like a cute little bunny.)

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,480
(The baby sleeping in my arms yesterday)

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
(is about to grow up)

124
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
(and become a fifteen-year-old girl.)

125
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,560
(I have left a special gift)

126
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
(For her 18th birthday)
(at the Moonrise Hotel.)

127
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,920
Mom left me a birthday gift

128
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
at the Moonrise Hotel.

129
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,671
(Moonrise Hotel)

130
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,560
Song.

131
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,520
Shaofei.

132
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,040
Why are you here?

133
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
I finished the work.

134
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
Came to keep you company.

135
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm here to pick something up.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll accompany you.

137
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Okay.

138
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,440
Hello.

139
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
Are you Miss Song from the call?

140
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,760
Yes, I am.

141
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,800
This way, please.

142
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Okay.

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,800
Sorry, sir.

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,840
Ms. Song Tong's item is in the VIP room.

145
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Only her daughter, Miss Song

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,360
can come and claim it.

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Shaofei.

148
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,200
Then wait for me a moment.

149
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll be right back.

150
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,360
Let's go. This way please.

151
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,720
So anxious?

152
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,160
Are you scared

153
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,320
that Yiyi'll run off,

154
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,680
or the Peerless Rose will disappear?

155
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,520
Master.

156
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,440
You're really keeping a close eye.

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,040
I won't let you hurt Yiyi.

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,960
Then you'd better watch closely.

159
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
