(VIP Room)

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,800
(This is the 18th birthday surprise
from your mom.)

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
(But on your birthday,)

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,440
(you didn't come.)

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,240
Don't worry,

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,760
I'll catch you

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,600
red-handed soon enough.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
Then let's see

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,600
who she believes.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Go with me.

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,560
Shaofei.

36
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
I've got it. Let's go.

37
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
Slowly.

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Slowly.

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,760
How is it, Mr. Xue?

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
Feeling better?

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,800
Did she stop by?

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
Miss Song came last night.

43
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
She brought you back.

44
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,800
Watched over you all night.

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
Where is she now?

46
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm here.

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,640
So she left.

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
Why did you come?

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Ungrateful guy.

50
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,920
Not my name.

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,080
Not my mom's name.

52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
Then,

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,920
what exactly is the password?

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,560
Mom,

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,440
what are you mixing?

56
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,200
We are cooking up some magic.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
Just for you!

58
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,040
(Acacia)
Acacia.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,120
(Iso E Super)
Iso E Super.

60
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,200
(Ylang)
Ylang.

61
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,104
(AIY)

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
That's it.

63
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,440
The password says 'love Yiyi'.

64
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,400
So the magic mom cooked for me

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,120
is the Peerless Rose.

66
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,360
Then what happened to this research?

67
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,320
Hello?

68
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,760
Yiyi.

69
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Let's meet.

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,720
Coincidentally,

71
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
I have something to ask you.

72
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
About

73
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
the Peerless Rose.

74
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,560
Xue.

75
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,800
Xue Fanyu, you...

76
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,640
It's nothing.

77
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,960
This minor injury won't kill me.

78
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,400
(I said,)

79
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,000
(sooner or later,
I'll take back all that's mine.)

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Mr. Xue,

81
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
I've checked.

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,760
Mr. Meng was studying overseas,
six years ago.

83
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,240
Go check

84
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
today's motorcycle.

85
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
I'll arrange.

86
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
Still hurt?

87
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Nope.

88
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
Since you're fine,

89
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm leaving.

90
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
I went to the warehouse.

91
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
But I fell for Wo Di's trick,

92
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
so I couldn't find you.

93
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Doesn't matter.

94
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
Even without Wu Di,

95
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,840
you brought up divorce first.

96
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,120
Because I was scared

97
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,640
that you'd mistake dependence for love

98
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
as you were too young

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,720
to understand what love really is.

100
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,880
So I...

101
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,560
I used to think

102
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,320
I really needed you around.

103
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
But now, honestly, I'm just exhausted.

104
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
There's something...

105
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
Never mind.

106
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
Leave it after you recover.

107
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,320
Yiyi.

108
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
