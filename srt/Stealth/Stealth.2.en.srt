Master.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
What are you doing?

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,160
Shaofei.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,000
We...

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,000
What else can it be?

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
A man and a woman.

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,200
Ms. Yang.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
You must've misunderstood.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
They didn't mean it.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,760
Everyone's got this bag these days.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,320
Time to throw it away.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,120
Ms. Yang.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,680
I have

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,080
a self-made perfume here.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
Fanyu.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,920
When will you

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,480
acknowledge me as Mrs. Xue?

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
(He's getting married?)

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,520
It's getting late.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,480
Time to go.

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,600
Ms. Yang.

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
Sorry.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm really sorry, Ms. Yang.

49
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Mrs. Xue.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Such bad luck.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,040
Shaofei.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Let's go.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,080
Mr. Yu is waiting for us.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,520
- Let's go.
- Ms. Yang.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,920
You don't really think
you can get into the Yulin Group

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
through Yang Nana, do you?

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,200
What's it to you?

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,520
Do you really think
your little tricks with Shaofei

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
will work as you wish?

60
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
Sorry.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm really sorry, Ms. Yang.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
Your flight is tonight.

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
Why?

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,560
Because I am your

65
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,160
dead uncle.

66
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,760
What are you doing?

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,120
This outfit doesn't suit you.

68
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Don't wear it again.

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,640
Okay.

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,520
If you ask me to take it off,

71
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,360
I'll take it off.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,320
I'll go over.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,760
Long time no see.

74
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,400
Ms. Li. Ms. Shen.

75
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,640
Ms. Yang.

76
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
It's very flattering.

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,240
A new product launches today, I heard.

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,760
Of course, perfect for you.

79
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,640
Gangzi.

80
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,960
This scent is unique.

81
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,240
About this scent,

82
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,520
its top notes are leaves and wild roses.

83
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Am I right, Ms. Yang?

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Gangzi.

85
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,800
The middle notes...

86
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,440
It's not right.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,040
It's not my perfume.

88
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,840
How could that be?

89
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
This isn't my bag.

90
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
You can't even tell?

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
There's no time.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,760
Hello, everyone.

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
Great welcome to

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,800
the new product launch
of our Yulin Group.

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,280
We present this perfume with sincerity.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,400
Ms. Yang,
your new perfume is quite unique.

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,120
But what are the middle notes?

98
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
The middle notes...

99
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,400
I knew it.

100
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,920
A nanny previously.

101
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,680
How...

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,280
Ms. Yang.

103
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Who is this?

104
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,320
Who is this?

105
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,360
The middle notes of this perfume are

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,520
plum trees,

107
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
mimosa and clary sage.

108
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,680
Right, Ms. Yang?

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,760
Right.

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,600
We were just waiting for her.

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,760
Meet our new team member.

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,440
Her name is...

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
My name is Song Yiyi.

114
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,400
Song, right.

115
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,480
So next,

116
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Song will

117
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,800
tell us briefly about

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
the creative concept
behind this new perfume.

119
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
Good. Good.

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
(Our perfume)

121
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,960
- (features a rare aquatic note.)
- Mr. Xue.

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
- (Its inspiration is drawn from)
- Miss Song aims to

123
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,848
- (a sunset-drenched beach.)
- join the R&D team.

124
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,120
- Shall we...
- It's fine.

125
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
(Its fragrance)

126
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,800
(takes you to a summer dusk
with sea breezes.)

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
Let her enjoy happiness a bit more.

128
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Let us indulge in a dream
of unrestrained joy

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,400
in this serene and slightly tipsy night.

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,760
So what is the name of this perfume?

131
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
(Yulin Group)
Song.

132
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,360
Our perfume is named "Stealth",

133
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,320
embodying a fleeting existence
veiled by falsehoods.

134
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
Light and shadow intertwine,

135
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,880
with no interference.

136
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,400
Good.

137
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,280
- Good.
- Good, good.

138
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,560
Song, you can do it.

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
Hmm.

140
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,520
(Mom.)

141
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
(This is where you used to work.)

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
(Here I am.)

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,360
(Why I'm in the parking lot?)

144
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
What exactly do you want?

145
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Go to the airport.

146
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
Three years ago,
you took away my mom's shares.

147
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,160
Isn't that enough
to exchange for my freedom?

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,920
Drive.

149
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
Master.

150
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,480
- Master. Master.
- Shaofei?

151
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,680
Master, open the door.

152
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,400
Master.

153
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
Shaofei, what do you want?

154
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,720
Master, you can't take Song away.

155
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
She's not your Ms. Right.

156
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,120
No matter what,

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
I just hope Song can do what she wants.

158
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,920
Naive.

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Drive.

160
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,240
Master.

161
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,880
What you want?

162
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
- Out of your mind?
- Master.

163
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,160
- Why meddle in my life?
- Master.

164
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,560
As long as you are not married,

165
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
- I've the right.
- Master.

166
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,520
Fine.

167
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Then I will get married right now.

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,000
Stop the car.

169
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,800
Shaofei.

170
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you willing to marry me?

171
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,320
Marry me.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,920
(How dare you take my man?)

173
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,480
Miss Song and Mr. Meng

174
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
met while studying abroad.

175
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,280
This time, it's also Mr. Meng

176
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,760
who helped her join the Yulin Group.

177
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,080
However,

178
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,040
would you really see Miss Song

179
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,520
marry Mr. Meng?

180
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,720
Do you know how to make roses thrive?

181
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,520
The damaged part

182
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,560
must be cut off promptly.

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,360
A softer heart

184
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,360
just makes the roses wilt faster.
