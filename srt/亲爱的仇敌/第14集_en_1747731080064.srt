00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:23,120
oh

4
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,120
oh

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ooh, Nia

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Nia

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are different from before

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Really?

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's the difference?

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You look tired

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You used to be so full of energy and effort

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now you are a little bit tired

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You seem not interested in anything

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How can I be like more than ten years ago?

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it's good

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
At least you look like a real person now

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I used to be so shy

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Your girlfriend is quite good now

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
She has brought you positive influence

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She is too young, too forgetful, and can be a burden

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am a little bit old and can't keep up with society

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't have a time to be at ease every day

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
After so much experience, we have found our own value

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I must show my chest, ok?

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What did I just tell you?

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Congratulations

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Congratulations

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I am sorry

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You are not wearing your shoes

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How can you go back?

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nia

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I am sorry

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I didn't know that this was the closest moment of our love

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I am sorry

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I am done

38
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How is it?

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you want to hear the truth?

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Of course

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think it's very beautiful

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Really?

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have been reading it since I woke up

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I didn't even have breakfast

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Did you sell this story?

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,820
Did you send me any

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
text messages or any other information?

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I want to show it to others

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Forget it

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What?

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't want to show off your kindness

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who was talking about yesterday

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't care about him

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who?

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Who?

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who?

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Who?

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I am not joking

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I am serious

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think he is good

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I want to recommend him to others

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will go get it

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wait for me

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There are not many topics like female?

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think your story is very well-known

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The characters are clear and the IQ is high

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do it well

71
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You might become a tycoon

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Really?

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think so too

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
In the next few years

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The theme of female alliance will become a tycoon

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There will be a beautiful, smart, cruel and cute woman

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
who plans a counterattack

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and turns it into an art

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's very artistic

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll take a picture of you

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll send it to you, Mr. Zhou

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I tell you

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The way you looked at me

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
was like two words

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Love

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was full of love

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Really

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Boss

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Listen to me

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In writing

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You must not give up

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You must persevere

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because you have talent

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But you must cherish it

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't waste your energy

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
on those trivial things

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll go make the newspaper

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wait

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The shoes I gave you

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
are the same as yours today

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Really?

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Here

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Perfect

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How can I describe it to you?

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I feel like what I saw at that time

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
was not Zhou Muxun

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Could it be

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the kind of father-son boyfriend

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
that others talk about?

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That female ally

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
is a very beautiful woman

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think so too

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think so too

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think so too

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That female ally

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Didn't you start writing this story

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
very early?

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I talked to Wu Hao before

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He was not interested in it

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But to be honest

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Zhou is indeed

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the man I know

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
who knows how to appreciate me the most

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What is the comparison between Wu Hao and Zhou Muxun?

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I have a conclusion anyway

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In China

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
when you think a man loves you

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
basically

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
he doesn't see you as his daughter

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
but his mother

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Some men

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
can't love a woman

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and appreciate her

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Basically

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
they look for a girlfriend

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
or a mother

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
or a daughter

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What does it mean to look for me?

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At first it was a daughter

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and then a mother

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How can your love

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
for more than ten years

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
be the same?

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My love

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
has not been over three years

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Your love for more than ten years

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is different

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's only been half a month since your birthday

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and you haven't planned

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
how to arrange your birthday party

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How are you going to spend your birthday with Zhou?

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I...

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't worry

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I will definitely come out

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
before my birthday

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will definitely come out

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I found

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
after thirty years

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I didn't want to celebrate my birthday

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How about this dress?

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This one?

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's like your dress

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Try it

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Try it

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hello, Luo Man

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm Cindy from Hengming

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm leaving

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sit down

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Miss Luo Man

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is the food and drinks arranged by Mr. Zhou

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Please tell me

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if you have any problem

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Give it to the guests first

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's good

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think if it's a short story

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
we can be bolder

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and throw out the whole case

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
it will be more novel

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Not only the structure

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think we can be bolder

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
on the theme

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why can't the female lead

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
have an offensive nature?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why can't we women

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
live for ourselves?

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, I think so too

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And we should be more practical

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The female lead now

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
can be not so perfect

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Actually, the audience

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
can accept it

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Be bolder

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm looking forward to it

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Go back and finish the script

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
A good script

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
will be written slowly

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We have patience

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't worry

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you have any ideas

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
we can communicate at any time

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Zhou Muzun is right

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You are excellent

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You are a very good writer

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You are not only good at writing

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but also very passionate

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I have known him for so long

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is the first time

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have heard him

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
praise each person's talent

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He said so?

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Not only that

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He said you are very diligent

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You are the kind of writer

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
who won't drag the script down

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mr. Zhou, you are flattering me

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Looking forward to our cooperation

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay

227
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm going back

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Be careful on the road

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yu Qiaoqiao

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How do you know

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that you are so thoughtful?

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I mean it

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've never met

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
such a good writer

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I have a feeling

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I will win this show

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
for sure

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let the most suitable person

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and resources match

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is my job

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You are so good

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Is there more?

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I feel good

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The food is getting delicious

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you going to make

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
an Italian noodle for my birthday?

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Italian longevity noodle?

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I will see how the chef feels

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You are always so secretive

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
By the way

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I seem to have seen

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
your ex-wife today

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She is here to pick up Cindy

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
She is a nice person

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Zhou

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You have worked hard

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't worry

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I will win this show

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
for sure

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Eat well

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Write the script after you finish eating

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You slept so late yesterday

265
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You didn't sleep well yesterday

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I didn't sleep well

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I am done

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Are you tired?

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You are so thoughtful

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Look

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You are tired

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I have a show at the studio tonight

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I will go there

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You will go out

275
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
after you pick up Cindy?

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hello, everyone

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I am Chen Kaixi

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Today I am here

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to say hello to you

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hello

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hello

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hello

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I am Chen Kaixi

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Today I am here

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to say hello to you

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to say hello to you

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to say hello to you

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to say hello to you

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hello

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hello

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Hello

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hello

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hello

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What kind of good food

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and story

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
are you going to tell us today?

297
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why is it Mrs. Zheng?

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Last time you told me

299
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that it was

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that Li Fei'an

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She doesn't have

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the mind to do this

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Honey, do you remember?

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
My son

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
likes this kind of food very much

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He can cook himself

307
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Aunt Xiu can cook too

308
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
My aunt can cook

309
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
My son can cook too

310
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Boys can cook

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It is rare to see

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A gentleman is willing to run away from his wife

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This is the idea of the ancient people

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The current educational field

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
is a kind of education

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
that teaches food and marriage

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It is a kind of education

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It is better than the last one

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How can Mrs. Zheng talk like this?

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You just give her a talk

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and she can keep talking

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I found out

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that you are getting more and more

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
into this

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It is very natural to ask questions

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Right?

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Honey, you don't understand this

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is called

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the topic guide

331
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It is like

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
you are picking up her words

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but actually

334
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
you are leading her

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to the next topic

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes, yes, yes

337
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But I think

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
if you continue to do this

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the netizens will get bored

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
in a few weeks

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You should add

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
something new

344
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Add something new

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Add something new

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What should I add?

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Honey, help me think about it

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think we should interact

349
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Honey

350
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The netizens now

351
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
really want to be valued

352
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and they want to interact

353
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Right?

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They need to have a sense of participation

355
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So can we

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
turn this

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
kitchen talk

358
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
into an open-minded one?

359
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
For example

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
when you were doing the interview

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
didn't you have the comments?

362
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then many netizens will ask

363
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Where do you rich people usually go?

364
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What kind of exercise do you do?

365
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Which restaurants are delicious?

366
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and so on

367
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you are in a hurry

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
you can ask them

369
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and they will answer you

370
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay

371
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The air is filled up

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
with a little air purifier

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
that is light and fragrant

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The air is filled up

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The air is filled up

376
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
with the air purifier

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
that you can buy at Weiping

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You can also buy it for free

379
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Go to Weiping

380
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and buy the best clothes

381
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
for three people

382
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why don't you

383
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
look for that one this time?

384
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That old dad

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and husband are very rich

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He has three children

387
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Mrs. Wu

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, yes, yes

389
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
She is quite well-maintained

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You can talk to her about Yue'er

391
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yue'er is quite good

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, we are Mrs. Xun

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We are Mrs. Xun

394
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We have three children

395
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and two are not enough

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And Tiao Tiao

397
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
comes back to me

398
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
from time to time

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and asks me

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
When will you

401
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
give me a brother or sister?

402
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then you can give her

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
another one

404
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yue'er is really good

405
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If I were an ordinary netizen

406
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I would be very curious

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
about how you

408
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
raise children

409
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Do you think

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have a special way

411
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
to raise children?

412
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Wait a minute

413
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I will finish this sentence

414
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What are you doing?

415
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You are trying to

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
make a joke

417
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No, I am trying to make a joke

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I have to teach her how to be a good person

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What's wrong?

420
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know what happened to her

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know what happened to her

422
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
She is always

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
like that

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
She is always like that

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and she always

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
quarrels with you

427
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You can quarrel with her

428
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No problem

429
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Who am I afraid of?

430
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well

431
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't be angry

432
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't be angry

433
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't be angry

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's good to quarrel

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The more you quarrel, the better

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Well

437
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think

438
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
on your birthday

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Mr. Zhou will

440
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
make a big move

441
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Right

442
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's not a quarrel

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's a small move

444
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I will give you

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
a piece of cake

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and two hot noodles

447
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What do you want?

448
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Birthday girl

449
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Birthday girl

450
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What are you talking about?

451
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You are talking about

452
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
a small thing in my heart

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What do you mean a small thing?

454
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a little bit unfortunate

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
A little bit unfortunate

456
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Anyway

457
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
a woman's birthday

458
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is a symbol of

459
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the position you are in her heart

460
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
no matter how a man expresses it

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is the first time

462
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
you two have celebrated your birthday

463
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
after being together

464
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Mr. Zhou

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
will definitely express it

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
After all

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I deserve it

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm so happy

471
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I envy you two

472
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You are born on the same day

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and born on the same day

474
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What a good fate

475
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I envy you

476
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You are also born on the same day

477
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Who wants to be born on the same day

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and born on the same day?

479
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is good

480
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Done

481
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You win

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How are you?

483
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How is the shooting going?

484
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's going well

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
with my friend Jiang

486
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Did anyone bully you?

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Not yet

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Tell me if you have any

489
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll help you

490
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sorry

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I have something to do

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm leaving now

493
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Right

494
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I have WeChat

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Bye

496
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I won't run away

497
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll leave it to you, editor

498
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hello, dad

499
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I discussed with your mom

500
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm going to buy you a house

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Buy a house?

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You have been saving money these years

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I also saved some money with your mom

504
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a whole lot

505
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was going to do your dowry

506
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
you are not in a hurry to get married

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Buying a house is too sudden

509
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You are not in a hurry

510
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm not in a hurry

511
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What do you mean?

512
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You are not in a hurry to get married

513
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You are not in a hurry to buy a house

514
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm telling you

515
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Your birthday is in a few days

516
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is your birthday gift

517
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll wait

518
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You should go out and see the house

519
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You must find a reliable agent

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do you hear me?

521
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Okay, I got it

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Why is the gift so strong?

523
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Mrs. Wu is not good at cooking

524
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We can shoot a video to give the kids a side dish

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's more like a child's theme

526
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay, we'll shoot more on the camera

527
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Zheng Kai Qi

528
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Zheng Kai Qi

529
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Honey

530
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is my husband's lunch

531
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is his lunch

532
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sorry

533
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry

534
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This is my husband's lunch

535
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This is our camera

536
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We'll talk about it later

537
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You go back first

538
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Okay

539
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Bye

540
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't understand

541
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Why do you care so much about reality?

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What's wrong?

543
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Did you find Li Bei An's lawyer?

544
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This is the phone

545
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hello

546
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because he wants Chen Chen's custody

547
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He has been at home for so many years

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Except for us, his wives

549
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He doesn't know anyone

550
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He really can't do anything

551
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So he asked me if I have a familiar lawyer

552
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Why don't you help him find someone else?

553
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Chen Kai Qi

554
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You're capable, right?

555
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You have a connection, right?

556
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, my husband is too cruel

557
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He doesn't even let his children see

558
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Have you ever thought about it for me?

559
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I know my husband

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Why does he miss me?

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Chen Kai Qi

562
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I really didn't find it

563
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You used to be very cold

564
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
How did you become a mother-in-law now?

565
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You want to control this little sting, right?

566
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If I hadn't met Wang Yu

567
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I wouldn't have known about this

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Chen Min, can you tell me the truth?

569
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I am a woman

570
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I am also a mother of a child

571
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I saw Li Wei An like that

572
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I was wrong to help him

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Besides

574
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I just introduced a lawyer to him

575
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
How to fight a lawsuit, how to judge, how to judge

576
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It has nothing to do with you and me

577
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Do you have to be so angry?

578
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
If there is such a day

579
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Will you treat me like this?

580
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You are

581
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You are just not good at doing things

582
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You are so stubborn

583
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
If you were my subordinate

584
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I would have fired you a thousand times already

585
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But I am not your subordinate

586
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I am your wife

587
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I am your child's mother

588
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Chen Min

589
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Do you not love me anymore?

590
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yes

591
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Happy

592
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you get bored every day?

593
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Bored?

594
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If you say you don't love me, then I don't love you

595
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But that house is really too small

596
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And it's too old

597
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Then why don't you consider that new house?

598
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yes

599
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You have seen that new house too

600
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's really too far

601
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And there are no equipment around

602
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's good if the subway is connected later

603
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But it's not this price at that time

604
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, I'll think about it again

605
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you

606
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why is it so difficult?

607
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You found the right one?

608
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I like it

609
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I can't afford it

610
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I can afford it

611
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But I don't like it

612
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Then wait a little longer

613
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Wait?

614
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's it

615
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
My budget is there anyway

616
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I want the transportation convenient

617
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The ones next to the subway are all old and broken

618
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
More than 40 square meters

619
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Even if I buy it, I won't live in it

620
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That new house is good

621
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But you know how far is that new house?

622
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's really far away

623
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's almost out of the ring

624
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Old and broken

625
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It's suitable for investment

626
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
New house is suitable for living

627
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes, and then?

628
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Choose the one you like at first sight

629
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The one I like at first sight

630
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Okay, don't bother

631
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Anyway, it's not an answer in a short time

632
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How about we drink this red wine?

633
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Let's watch a movie

634
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll go to drink

635
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm busy now

636
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Is this the one?

637
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes

638
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Why don't you sleep?

639
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Aren't you the same?

640
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Hello

641
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm different from you

642
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm a person who dares to write a script

643
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's hard

644
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Xixi

645
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You're 33 years old

646
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
What's your birthday wish?

647
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
There's an old saying

648
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
33, a knife show

649
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I just want my life to be original

650
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm satisfied

651
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You don't have high requirements

652
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You're old and old

653
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What else can you do?

654
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
What about you?

655
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What's your birthday wish?

656
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You know all my birthday wishes

657
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Sleep early

658
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Drink a cup of hot milk

659
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
To warm up

660
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Okay, good night

661
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Good night

662
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What wish did you make?

663
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I want a lot of money

664
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You want a lot of love

665
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I want to have a big family

666
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You just need to use your face

667
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm sorry

668
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You always give me the same gift

669
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Is it too creative?

670
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You're the same

671
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But since you've given me this

672
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Are you too conservative?

673
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm not conservative

674
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Come on

675
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Let's have a drink

676
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Let's have a drink

677
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
How's it going?

678
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What's going on with you?

679
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Did Boss Zhou arrange it?

680
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Zhou?

681
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He's on a business trip

682
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
He said he'd be back next week

683
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Come on

684
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
From what you know about men like them

685
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The first birthday of Zhou and me

686
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What will he give me on my birthday?

687
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Did you tell him what you want?

688
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No, who dares to open their mouth?

689
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's right

690
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's probably a Kelly or a Berkina

691
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's the standard for men like them to give their girlfriends

692
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So realistic

693
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I like it

694
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm not dead

695
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's beautiful

696
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's beautiful to give you, right?

697
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He doesn't really like this kind of thing

698
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Basically, he buys everything he wants

699
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He doesn't even have a taste for it

700
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Every time he has a birthday party

701
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
He gives out a happy birthday cake

702
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And he's the kind of guy who buys it in the airport

703
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He's very generous

704
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm telling you

705
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Straight men don't have high expectations

706
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No expectations

707
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No expectations

708
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Just hit me with a gift

709
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride

710
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
No need

711
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Zhou's driver is waiting for me downstairs

712
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He's going to give you a ride?

713
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
No, I'm just going to listen to him

714
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm going to give you a ride

715
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Happy birthday

716
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
All your wishes will come true

717
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Happy birthday

718
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's a special night

719
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Be happy

720
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Don't let me down

721
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You'll be happy

722
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Happy birthday

723
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Happy birthday

724
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Happy birthday

725
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Happy birthday, Luo Man

726
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Happy birthday, Luo Man

727
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Happy birthday, Luo Man

728
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Happy birthday, Luo Man

729
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Didn't you say you'd be back next week?

730
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm highly efficient at work

731
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Is that okay?

732
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I misunderstood

733
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I thought you were coming back

734
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
To celebrate my birthday

735
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Maybe

736
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Do you remember our first meal?

737
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I was pretending to be with you

738
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I said

739
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't think there's any special

740
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Good Cantonese food here

741
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I can't help it

742
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I can only make my own

743
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Salty fish with eggplant and crispy skin

744
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Do you remember?

745
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I remember

746
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I lied to you

747
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't even know how much water I put in the food

748
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Actually

749
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I've seen it before

750
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
How did you see it?

751
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Isn't it obvious enough?

752
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Otherwise

753
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Do you think you have any secrets

754
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That I don't know?

755
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
There are many

756
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm a mysterious woman

757
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
With your personality

758
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
If you can cook

759
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You would have been a good cook

760
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You could have blown up my kitchen

761
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You know me so well

762
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Then

763
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Then why do you still like me?

764
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I don't know

765
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
No, no, no

766
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You must know

767
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I know

768
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I just like

769
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Sometimes you are very smart

770
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Sometimes

771
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You look very smart

772
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
For example, now

773
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like this

774
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You said I have a complete stupidity, right?

775
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I didn't say that

776
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I didn't say that

777
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Can I operate it?

778
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes

779
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You know I'm with you

780
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
When do you feel the happiest?

781
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
When?

782
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's just

783
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Sometimes

784
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
When I'm with you

785
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I feel

786
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm understood

787
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Sometimes

788
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I didn't even realize

789
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The flash in my body

790
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Then

791
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Including the shortcomings in my body

792
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You also feel very precious

793
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You let me see how good I am

794
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I will feel

795
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I will understand

796
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I feel very happy

797
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Then I have to say

798
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
In my hand

799
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
In your body

800
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
All are life

801
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I understand

802
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Sorry, wait a minute

803
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I will write it down

804
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Ok

805
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Actually I am very curious about one thing

806
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
This is in your WeChat

807
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What is the birthday I prepared?

808
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I

809
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Luo Man

810
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You You You Ba

811
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So hard, Mr. Zhou

812
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So hard

813
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So hard

814
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You guess

815
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
How did Zhou remember my birthday?

816
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
He wrote my birthday

817
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
In the name of the assistant

818
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Really simple and rough

819
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I don't understand

820
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He should do it

821
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Happy birthday, Luo Man and Kaixi

822
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I didn't expect that Mr. Zhou

823
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Also has a day full of desire to survive

824
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I am sorry

825
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000

884
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Tiatiao's mother

885
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I want to go home at nine

886
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Can I?

887
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes

888
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,340
Are you excited for your davonnation?

889
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,840
I'm excited to see you happy this year,

890
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,980
and to see you singing.

891
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,380
Yes, you sure are.

892
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,880
See you soon.

893
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,460
Yes.

894
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
What are you staring at?

895
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,860
I guess?

896
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,480
Such an excellent cook.

897
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Well, I want to see it too.

898
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,000
How can there be such a cute woman?

899
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
How can there be?

900
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,800
Thank you for preparing all this for me.

It's my pleasure.

Don't worry.

I'll definitely give you a good massage later.

00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,000
Well, I have to prepare well.

905
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Wait a minute.

906
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Don't peek.

907
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Can I turn around?

908
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Sure.

909
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Happy Birthday.

910
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,840
This is what Mr. Chen Mian asked me to give you.

911
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840

This is from Mr. Chen.

928
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
Oh.

929
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
He canceled his flight tonight.

930
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Mr. Chen really wanted to fly back

931
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
and celebrate his birthday with you.

932
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Oh.

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
That Cos wash is thick.

975
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,880
thousands of flowers

976
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,880
I'm thinking we can work together on this.

977
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
Okay.

978
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,880
This is...

979
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,880
I'm sorry.

980
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,880
You don't like the gift I gave you?

981
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,880
No, I like it.

982
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Chen Mian said that gifts represent attitude.

983
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,880
How a man expresses his woman's fate

984
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,880
represents the position you are in his heart.

985
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Then it's probably a carrier or a birthday gift.

986
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,880
It's the standard for a man to give his girlfriend.

987
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,880
Every time he gives a birthday gift, he gives a gift.

988
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,880
And it looks like he bought it on the market.

989
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,880
It's very eye-catching.

990
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,880
It's okay.

991
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
If you don't like it, you can tell me.

992
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,880
It's not that I don't like it.

993
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,880
Then it's not that I don't like it.

994
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
I don't like it.

995
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,880
What are you doing?

996
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Is it necessary?

997
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,880
At least let me finish.

998
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,880
I just didn't expect you to be so...

999
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,880
So what?

1000
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,880
So...

1001
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,880
Can you be honest?

1002
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,880
I always think that the biggest advantage of you is being honest.

1003
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Okay, then I'll be honest.

1004
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
I don't like it.

1005
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
Does it sound nice?

1006
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,880
Can I not like my birthday gift?

1007
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
I have the right to do that, right?

1008
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Of course.

1009
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
Then...

1010
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Don't you want to ask me why I don't like it?

1011
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
Why?

1012
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,880
I already know.

1013
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,880
What do you know?

1014
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
I don't like it.

1015
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,880
The world is like a lake

1016
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,880
Even if it's just a breeze

1017
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,880
The days are long gone

1018
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,880
The world is very beautiful

1019
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,880
The most beautiful when you look back

1020
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,880
I dare to face myself

1021
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,880
Reborn or destroyed

1022
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,880
I see the moonlight

1023
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,880
The wind is cool

1024
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,880
The world is like a big stadium

1025
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,880
The game is endless

1026
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,880
The wind is cool

1027
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,880
The main character is okay

1028
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Life will always come to an end

1029
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Whether you are okay or not

1030
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,880
Thank you for doing everything

1031
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,880
Let yourself be proud of that

1032
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,880
Let your life go from the beginning to the end

1033
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:15,880
How do you think of me?

1034
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,880
Thank you for watching!
