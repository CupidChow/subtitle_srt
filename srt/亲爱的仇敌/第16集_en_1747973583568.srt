I'm so happy to be with you

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm so happy to be with you

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm so happy to be with you

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm so happy to be with you

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm so happy to be with you

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm so happy to be with you

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

Stay with me

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thanks to Elvis

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There's already one, but it's two

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You ready!

Yu Yang

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,980
Really

31
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,820
I'm not sure.

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,220
I think this is a good thing.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,420
Right?

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,420
We found out that you were in a hurry to cooperate with the treatment.

35
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,420
Isn't it over?

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,420
Besides, the medical resources here are definitely better than the old house.

37
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,020
Right?

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,020
We are the old house's medical supplies. Can we repay them here?

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,620
I'm not sure either.

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,820
Anyway, you should start with the ticket first.

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,420
You can repay them and then talk.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,620
Don't worry about the money.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,020
The treatment is the first.

44
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,420
A Luo,

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,220
I have to apologize to you.

46
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,020
Don't get angry with me.

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
You'll get a divorce if you eat up.

48
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,820
Can you give me a break until the age of 80?

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
You're already old.

50
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,620
How old am I?

51
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,620
Uncle, you're already old.

52
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,820
Who cares about your marriage?

53
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Whatever.

54
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,420
You need a massage, right?

55
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,420
You haven't recognized a doctor for such a long time.

56
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,820
Ancestral.

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,040
Hello, hi, ح Neben

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,960

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,300

Ooh.

70
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,440
Sorry to进 footprints.

71
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,240

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
It's a pity it's a regular month.

74
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,660
The baby may have mature�.

75
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,360
You know her.

76
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,240
Can't you just treat her as she is?

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,400
Yes.

78
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,840
When I'm sleeping,

79
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,400
take her to the hospital.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,700
Oops, sorry.

81
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,740
Director,

82
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,340
I want to review it again.

83
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,740
Is it cancer?

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
I'm not sure yet.

85
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,940
It's a bit big and a bit of a Maoist.

86
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,540
But it's not certain.

87
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,740
It's better to wait until the results are out.

88
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,040
How about this?

89
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,240
You can download an apple from our hospital.

90
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,740
It's easier to hang out with them.

91
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,140
Right.

92
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
The date is 4am every day.

93
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,140
You can set up a reminder.

94
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,440
This is the expert.

95
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Do you have a medical kit?

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,340
Yes.

97
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,440
From the local to the foreign?

98
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
Yes.

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,240
Then contact the medical kit.

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,440
Set up a medical kit.

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Wait a minute. I'll remember.

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Every day...

103
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,240
4am.

104
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,540
And then...

105
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,640
The director.

106
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,540
A medical kit.

107
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,340
Okay.

108
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,540
A medical kit.

109
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,640
What else do you need?

110
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,140
Don't be too nervous.

111
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,040
Many people don't need a surgery.

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Even if they need a surgery,

113
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,840
the technology is very advanced.

114
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,140
You're right.

115
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,540
Thank you.

116
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,140
For...

117
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,940
For the treatment.

118
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,740
For the treatment.

119
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,140
For the home and the WeChat.

120
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,940
Okay.

121
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,840
I'll do it.

122
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
Okay.

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,340
Thank you.

124
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,440
Okay.

125
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,140
Miss Luo.

126
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,740
If you have any questions, please contact me.

127
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,140
I'll leave now.

128
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,340
Thank you.

129
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,540
Thank you.

130
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,840
What is this?

131
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,540
Nothing.

132
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,740
Nothing.

133
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,340
Take it slow.

134
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll ask you.

135
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,740
My mom told me that my dad's sister

136
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,040
has been out for several years.

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,840
He never told me.

138
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,540
And I saw that he didn't smoke,

139
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,240
didn't drink, and even exercised.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,340
When he scolded me,

141
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,440
I was so sick.

142
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,940
I didn't expect...

143
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,240
Sometimes, people are like this.

144
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,540
People are like cars.

145
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,740
When they go to the gym,

146
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
they always have problems with the small parts.

147
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,040
If you keep on taking care of them,

148
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
you can go to the gym again.

149
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,340
Don't think too much.

150
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,640
You're telling me.

151
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,740
Thank you.

152
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,240
You even said thank you to me.

153
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,140
And...

154
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,940
That day...

155
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,240
Those words...

156
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm sorry, too.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Don't be so mean.

159
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,240
Why are you here?

161
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm not pregnant.

162
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,440
Isn't this a big thing?

163
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,240
God is giving you a baby.

164
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,140
Congratulations.

165
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,940
Congratulations.

166
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Congratulations.

167
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,640
Honey, I'm going to take a shower.

168
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,740
Honey, honey, honey.

169
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Tell me.

170
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,640
Is this real?

171
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,540
Is this real?

172
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,440
Yes.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm so happy.

174
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Honey, I'm so happy.

175
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Honey, when is the baby? I'll go with you.

176
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Next Monday.

177
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
Honey, do you know?

178
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm so happy.

179
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
I'm so happy.

180
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,740
Honey, when is the baby?

181
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll go with you.

182
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,040
Honey, do you know?

183
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,440
I finally have a daughter.

184
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,740
Honey, do you know?

185
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,640
I have two daughters.

186
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
I have to pay for them.

187
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Who said you have a daughter?

188
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Come on.

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,540
Let's go talk to Tiao-yong.

190
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,740
She has a sister.

191
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,440
What are you talking about?

192
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,340
It's not three months yet.

193
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,840
Honey, I have a feeling.

194
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,440
This time, she must be a sister.

195
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,640
Think about it.

196
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm going to call the Chinese.

197
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,840
We'll go to the private school and call them together.

198
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,540
We'll call the Chinese. Okay?

199
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,640
Okay.

200
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,940
Honey, it's not my fault.

201
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,940
I can't leave the private school.

202
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
But don't worry.

203
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,240
I've already called the Chinese.

204
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,940
If you have something to do, call her.

205
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,840
Be good.

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,540
Okay, I got it.

207
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,240
Honey, check the check-in number.

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,740
Tell me the first time.

209
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,940
Next time, I'll pay for it.

210
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,140
It's okay. It's not the first time.

211
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,040
I know it.

212
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,240
Shi-hao, it's your turn.

213
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,740
I'll hang up now.

214
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Let me see.

215
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,840
Be careful.

216
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,240
No, no.

217
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,940
Be careful. Don't be anxious.

218
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm fine.

219
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,840
Hello?

220
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,440
Hello, Xi-xi.

221
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,340
I want to see the cousin of Chen Min.

222
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
He's a doctor, right?

223
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,140
My dad has a medical report.

224
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,740
The condition of the lung is not good.

225
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
Don't worry.

226
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,540
I'm just in their hospital.

227
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,040
You can bring the report and come over.

228
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,140
Okay, thank you.

229
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,540
I'll wait for you.

230
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,660
Let me see.

231
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,340
How come it's tougher than Hehe's eye makeup?

232
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,980
director

233
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,580
director

234
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,900
Hello

235
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,940
Hello

236
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,640
Dr. Fang, well...

237
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,940
Is it convenient for you to talk?

238
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,740
Yes, you can talk.

239
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,640
I have something to ask you.

240
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,740
I've been taking the number for two days. I can't even take it.

241
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,940
I want to ask if you know the hospital.

242
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,440
I don't know.

243
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,240
I haven't found the patient yet.

244
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,040
The director hasn't taught me.

245
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,340
Okay, I understand. I'll be in the way.

246
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Wait a minute.

247
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,040
Director Xie will release a number on the day of the operation.

248
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,140
But he has to go to the hospital early.

249
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Can you do that?

250
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,640
Of course. Of course I can.

251
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,540
Send me the patient's information first.

252
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,040
I'll look for the senior.

253
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,140
Don't panic. We'll do what we can.

254
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,140
Okay. Thank you.

255
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,540
The patient is in the hospital.

256
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,440
I told you,

257
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,940
if you can't look at it,

258
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,540
you don't need to look at it.

259
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,540
It's okay. I'll take care of you.

260
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,540
Don't think of me as a mom.

261
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm not a mom.

262
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm not a mom.

263
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,540
Okay, okay.

264
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,940
Okay. I'll treat you.

265
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,140
Okay, okay.

266
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,440
Where are you going?

267
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,740
What are you doing? Line up.

268
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,040
Wait.

269
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,540
Line up.

270
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,840
Go ahead.

271
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,940
Let's go to the hospital.

272
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
I've picked up the stuff. I've got the money.

273
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,740
I'll give you a discount.

274
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,340
Sorry.

275
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,040
I need to fill up the file.

276
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Hurry, hurry.

277
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,240
You've checked it already.

278
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,540
Done.

279
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:21,100
Do you want to replace the

280
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,540
live adjustment which has been completed?

281
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,940
Why change the officers' clothes?

282
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,140
I should live determinedly.

283
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Right?

284
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,740
I should do what we can do.

285
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
Mr. Xie from the company, Jia Hao.

286
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,380
Thank you. No need.

287
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,820
Thank you for helping me.

288
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,060
It's not me.

289
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,060
It's not you.

290
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,820
Xie Xie.

291
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
I... I've never talked to him.

292
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,300
Maybe it's Mr. Zhou.

293
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,740
Mr. Zhou.

294
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,420
I asked your dad about your dad's case.

295
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,580
He heard it.

296
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,740
He asked me to look for the information.

297
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,940
I've told Mr. Xie.

298
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,380
But he said he's been involved with the patient.

299
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,220
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm sorry I'm late.

301
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
It's okay. Thank you.

302
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,300
It's okay. Thank you.

303
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,680

304
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740

I'm going to make a bed.

347
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
My bed is in the closet.

348
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
I'm going to make a bed in the closet.

349
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
I'm going to make a bed in my closet.

350
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,740
However, I can't sleep with a song on it.

351
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,360
Are you getting married now,

352
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,540
But I'm getting married.

353
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,440
Why do you put in this face?

354
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
It's my first time.

355
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,540
Why do you always do this.

356
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:57,540
I just want to thank you.

357
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
You're so kind.

358
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Why don't you say something?

359
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:15,540
I...

360
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Because I...

361
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm on business.

362
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm here to see you.

363
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
I'm hanging up.

364
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
I'm here to see you.

365
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Qiqi, it's really...

366
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
We two kids are really...

367
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
If they were hanging up at home,

368
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,540
the roof had to be turned upside down.

369
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,540
But if I could be pregnant,

370
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
I'd still want to.

371
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Really?

372
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,540
It's like having more kids at home.

373
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
It's better to have more kids.

374
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
What did I say just now?

375
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
I said, after I finished talking,

376
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
my head was running.

377
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
I said, we two kids.

378
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
I said, my boss.

379
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,540
When he was at home,

380
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
he didn't have a second child.

381
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
He was really a little father.

382
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
He was my son-in-law.

383
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
Everyone had to play with him.

384
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
But after he was born,

385
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
he didn't tell his boss

386
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
to take care of his brother.

387
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
But one day,

388
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,540
he suddenly learned to share.

389
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
He was really talkative.

390
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,540
It's true that he's got a different kid.

391
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
When I was pregnant,

392
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
I had a big reaction.

393
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
I heard that my second child would be better.

394
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Not necessarily.

395
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
When I was pregnant,

396
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
I didn't have any reaction.

397
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
I should eat, drink, play with my brother.

398
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
But I was still pregnant.

399
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
I was 100% pregnant.

400
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
You were 100%.

401
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
If I had half of my life,

402
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
I would be gone.

403
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
I was 100%.

404
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
Look.

409
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
You're so annoying.

410
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Who drew it?

411
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,540
Don't you always say that?

412
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
In the war,

413
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
you were the enemy.

414
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,540
In the war, you were the enemy.

415
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Now is the time to use this word.

416
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Smile.

417
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Smile.

418
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Smile.

419
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Smile.

420
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
Smile.

421
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Smile.

422
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
Smile.

423
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
Smile.

424
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Smile.

425
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Smile.

426
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
Smile.

427
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Smile.

428
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Baby,

429
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
do you want a younger brother or a younger sister?

430
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
I want a younger brother.

431
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Didn't you say that

432
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,540
you're envious of Prince Mu and a younger sister?

433
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
Because I'm older,

434
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
I can protect my mother more.

435
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Protecting your mother is daddy's thing.

436
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
You're not the one who's in trouble.

437
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
But daddy is always at home.

438
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Because daddy is working.

439
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
If daddy doesn't work,

440
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
you'll get so many loco papers.

441
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,540
Mommy.

442
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
What?

443
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,540
My little baby is working with me.

444
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
My little baby is working with me.

445
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,540
Even if you have a younger brother or sister,

446
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,540
your mother will always love you the most, right?

447
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Forever.

448
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Right?

449
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
It feels like

450
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,540
you're always in a daze.

451
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,540
You're like drinking water.

452
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,540
How are you?

453
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Can you come over?

454
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
I can.

455
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
I can still carry it.

456
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
To be honest,

457
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,540
I really like the script I'm writing now.

458
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,540
I hide in there every day and knock on the door.

459
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,540
I don't want to go to the outside world.

460
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
How can I say it?

461
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,540
It's easy to understand.

462
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Especially the money.

463
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,540
This script is my life story now.

464
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
Every time I knock on a word,

465
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,540
it's like a burning incense.

466
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
Two words are the same.

467
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
How about you?

468
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
How are you doing?

469
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Are you happy?

470
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
He's busy with the business.

471
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
That's all.

472
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,540
Women don't really need men.

473
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,540
If you can let go of your obsession,

474
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540
you can't be like me.

475
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Baby.

476
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
Are you asleep?

477
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Hello?

478
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Why is it so hard to find?

479
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,540
My house just got a house.

480
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Your father found out about this disease.

481
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
What's wrong with you?

482
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
I'm sorry.

485
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,540
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
I'm sorry.

489
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
I'm sorry.

490
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
I'm sorry.

491
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
Yes,

492
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,540
the money is going to be here.

493
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
I'm not so nervous.

494
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,540
But your father told me a few days ago.

495
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Even if you find out the cause first,

496
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
you still have to buy the house.

497
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
He doesn't want to be affected by his business.

498
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,540
He said he can't afford to buy the house now.

499
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
Why?

500
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,540
Why did my father ask?

501
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Why did he have to buy the house?

502
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,260
Did he hear what others said?

503
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,900
Did someone compare him with him?

504
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
No.

505
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,660
He regretted it.

506
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,500
He said that

507
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,060
Chen Kaixi's family

508
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,700
bought him a house in his graduation.

509
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Our family

510
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,660
didn't have that strength.

511
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,060
You made the money by yourself.

512
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,780
He thought

513
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,700
buying this house was your assets.

514
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,340
A woman's house and house

515
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,100
have itsimmen

516
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,700
regardless of herself.

517
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Her percent lowered.

518
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,620
Afterthat,

519
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Xiuma, what would you like to eat?

520
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,400
You haven't eaten anything outside.

521
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,540
I think I'll eat that.

522
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,580
Mom.

523
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Well...

524
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Well...

525
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,700
I'll pay you back the money.

526
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
And...

527
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,020
I'll pay you back the money from your account.

528
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,020
About 300,000 won. Is that enough?

529
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,580
Do you have money? Is that enough?

530
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,420
No. Don't worry.

531
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,100
The producer said he'll pay me back the money next week.

532
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Don't worry.

533
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,940
He'll pay me back the money next week.

534
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Okay.

535
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,580
Is that enough?

536
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Yes.

537
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,500
See you.

538
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,860
Come with me.

539
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660
Thank you.

540
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,040
We...

541
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,060
From your friends?

542
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
From your friends.

543
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
Thank you.

544
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,100
Ex card

545
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,520
Dr. Ji

546
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
my family member leader came

547
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,180
Coming

548
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,800
Who is in the hospital?

549
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,500
My daughter

550
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,380
This's my mother

551
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Doctors

552
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,560
You just tell me the truth

553
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,660
I can use your office

554
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,880
I want to know the real situation

555
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,640
then let me

556
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
The situation is like this.

557
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
The patient is not in a big problem.

558
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
He is thinking of a lung transplant.

559
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
The most important thing is to get him out of the hospital.

560
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,640
But this time, the examination found that

561
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
the condition of the lymphatic system is not good.

562
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,640
It is possible that it is a transfer.

563
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
This is a bit troublesome.

564
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,640
What should we do now, doctor?

565
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,640
I suggest that you go to the hospital and get your surgery.

566
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Doctor, do you want to...

567
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
No.

568
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Doctor, we will listen to you.

569
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Get your surgery.

570
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Okay.

571
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Hello, Director.

572
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Sorry, I have something to do at home these days.

573
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
I will be there in a minute.

574
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
Can you read the control?

575
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Can you go to the company?

576
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
The company?

577
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,640
What's wrong?

578
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,640
There are some problems with this project.

579
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I think you can't do it.

580
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Okay.

581
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
See you tomorrow.

582
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Don't worry. We will treat you to a meal.

583
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,640
We have experience.

584
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,640
Okay, see you later.

585
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Okay, bye.

586
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Sorry.

587
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Have some tea.

588
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Thank you.

589
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Kexin, you look so good.

590
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
You look so good.

591
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Really?

592
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
You are a sweet baby.

593
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,640
I am so sad that I can't take it anymore.

594
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
I remember that I was so sad that I couldn't take it anymore.

595
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,640
I was so sad that I couldn't take it anymore.

596
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,640
My dad prepared a diet meal for me.

597
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
I couldn't take it anymore.

598
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I want to eat the stinky tofu next to school.

599
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I can even drive for a few hours to buy it.

600
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,640
It's really a wrong hand.

601
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
No wonder you are so worried about me.

602
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,640
You are coming back after a long time.

603
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
You are so worried about me.

604
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
You are going to be back soon.

605
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
You want me to send you these for free.

606
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I am just a big fan of you.

607
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,640
You have to be careful about everything in the company.

608
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
You are so heavy.

609
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
It's a big trouble for you to go to the office.

610
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,640
It's okay. I should be here.

611
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Wait for me.

612
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Kexin, you are so kind.

613
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
This is too expensive.

614
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,640
You are busy with work under the bed.

615
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
You don't have to be kind to me.

616
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
You and Mr. Mian are so nice to me.

617
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
That's because you are kind.

618
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
I will go first.

619
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
By the way, did you know that Tiao-tiao wants a younger brother or sister?

620
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,640
I want a younger brother.

621
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
But I want a daughter.

622
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Do you know that?

623
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
I already have a son and I want a daughter.

624
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I will take the exam.

625
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I will go first.

626
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Here is your food.

627
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Thank you.

628
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
I will treat you to a meal.

629
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
I will have a seat at the restaurant.

630
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
It's so cold.

631
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Eat something warm.

632
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
I will treat you to a meal.

633
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Who are you talking about?

634
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Wait. I am busy.

635
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
I am busy.

636
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Okay, I am almost there.

637
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
What are you doing?

638
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
I am here to treat you to a meal.

639
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Thank you for your help during this time.

640
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
I will drink to you.

641
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Cheers.

642
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
I will drink.

643
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
I will drink.

644
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
I will drink.

645
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
It's hot.

646
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
I am thirsty.

647
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
I will drink.

648
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
I can't drink to you.

649
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
It's okay. Just one glass.

650
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
We will have a meeting later.

651
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
I told you.

652
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Drink something warm.

653
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
It's okay.

654
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
It's so cold in the south.

655
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
It's colder than outside.

656
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
My room is like a fridge.

657
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
And my room is broken.

658
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
I brought a TV.

659
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
I am freezing.

660
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
You can stay here tonight.

661
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
It's good to be here.

662
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
It's cold.

663
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Don't be so cold.

664
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Okay.

665
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
Let me put it down.

666
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
It's cold.

667
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I am freezing.

668
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
It's cold.

669
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I am freezing.

670
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Yes.

671
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,640
You can open 100 or 200 groups.

672
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,640
You can't even reach 10.

673
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,640
No one is sending group messages in the group chat.

674
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Is your alarm ready?

675
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
No.

676
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
I am thinking about

677
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,640
what kind of group chat I can do.

678
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
I can do whatever I want.

679
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Can you open it in a year?

680
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
It's okay.

681
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
After the shooting,

682
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,640
I can borrow your time.

683
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Please.

684
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Hello?

685
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I am still outside.

686
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Okay. I will go back later.

687
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Okay. Bye.

688
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
The director will be back tomorrow.

689
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
I have a car.

690
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
I will take you there.

691
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I will change the address.

692
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
What's wrong?

693
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
What are you laughing at?

694
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Didn't you ask me before?

695
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Your acting is not right.

696
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
Actually, there is nothing wrong.

697
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Your acting is good.

698
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Sometimes,

699
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
you will act too much.

700
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
You are smart.

701
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
But you are too smart.

702
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
You are too smart.

703
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
You are too smart.

704
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
I think...

705
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I think it's this one.

706
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
I am going upstairs.

707
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I am going to the sixth floor.

708
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Go back.

709
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Send me a message.

710
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Come upstairs.

711
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I am going to the sixth floor.

712
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Go back.

713
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Send me a message.

714
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Yes.

715
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,640
I know you have losses.

716
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,640
But I don't want the whole money.

717
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I have to pay the money for the draft.

718
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
After all, I...

719
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Okay.

720
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Okay. I will wait for you.

721
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Ddi.

722
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Well...

723
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
I know what you mean.

724
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Don't worry.

725
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
I will get the money back.

726
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
Don't worry about this.

727
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Don't worry.

728
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Hello, Sister Cindy.

729
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Do you think the new project is good enough?

730
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
It's not good enough.

731
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
It's okay.

732
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
It's convenient. Tell me.

733
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Hello.

734
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Yes.

735
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
I know.

736
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
Miss.

737
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Are you okay?

738
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
Yes.

739
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
But you should understand us.

740
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
After all, I have so many small dramas.

741
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
We haven't changed so much.

742
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,640
You saw the script quality.

743
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Sorry.

744
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
It's almost New Year.

745
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
We have to go back to New Year.

746
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Yes.

747
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
But...

748
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,640
We can't talk about the three-level program.

749
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
So, everyone...

750
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Right?

751
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,640
It's too difficult to see the bottom in a circle.

752
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
Okay.

753
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Okay.

754
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
I will wait for your letter.

755
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Okay. Bye.

756
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
What are you looking for?

757
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
No need.

758
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Who said no need?

759
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Yes.

760
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,640
You didn't do the surgery.

761
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
You think you can run and jump.

762
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
My mom and I can take care of you.

763
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
You can go to the hospital after the surgery.

764
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
What if my mom and I can't take care of you?

765
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
My mom is not feeling well.

766
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
She is suffering from a heart attack.

767
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,640
How can I pull you two out of the car?

768
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Mom.

769
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
She is okay.

770
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Your dad doesn't like to be taken care of.

771
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Besides, I am not worried.

772
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
What is there to worry about?

773
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,640
I have a male nurse.

774
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
She is more powerful than you.

775
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
My dad is also comfortable.

776
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
What is there to worry about?

777
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
I know.

778
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,640
You two are just a little bit of money.

779
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
Money is the right thing to do.

780
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
You have to spend it.

781
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
I can do it.

782
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Mr. Oh.

783
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
You are such a good daughter.

784
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
You are so lucky.

785
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Yes.

786
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
I am lucky.

787
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
I am more afraid.

788
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Dr. Fang is here.

789
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Uncle and aunt.

790
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Dr. Fang.

791
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
You are so busy.

792
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I am so sorry.

793
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
It's okay.

794
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
I came to see you.

795
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
I just saw your data check report.

796
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
You said that the indicators are good.

797
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,640
If you have any problems with the checkup after the surgery,

798
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
you can go to the hospital.

799
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Okay. Thank you.

800
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Dr. Fang.

801
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
I want to ask you something.

802
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Do you have any other questions?

803
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
You are a patient.

804
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
You need to be quick and calm.

805
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,640
You need to be calm and calm.

806
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Right?

807
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
You need to be calm and happy.

808
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
You need to be a nurse.

809
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Everyone is a nurse.

810
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Okay.

811
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
I will listen to Dr. Fang.

812
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Okay.

813
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
Then, Dad.

814
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
I will bring you something to eat tomorrow.

815
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Oh, right.

816
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Dr. Fang.

817
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Can I ask what is my dad's excuse?

818
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
It's okay.

819
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,640
The mood is the most important thing.

820
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Do you hear me?

821
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
The mood is the most important thing.

822
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Dr. Fang.

823
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Thank you.

824
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Thank you.

825
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
My dear.

826
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
I am back.

827
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
My dear,

828
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
I miss you.

829
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
My dear.

830
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,640
The first thing I do is to say to you.

831
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
I miss you so much.

832
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
I miss you so much.

833
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
I miss you so much.

834
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
I miss you so much.

835
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
I miss you so much.

836
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
I miss you.

837
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Darling.

838
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I am back.

839
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
You sleep here. Don't play with me.

840
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,640
Wife, take a shower first. It's better to throw it away.

841
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
I can't eat it.

842
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
You can't eat it?

843
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
I can't eat it.

844
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm so tired.

845
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
I can't eat it.

846
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
I can't even sleep.

847
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I can't eat it.

848
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
You're so good.

849
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
Why are you so good?

850
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,640
You know how to play when I'm dancing.

851
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Now?

852
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
I'm so tired.

853
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
You can sleep in the office after work.

854
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,640
Why are you here?

855
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Wife, I'm not coming back.

856
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,640
I'll let you stay in the bathroom.

857
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
Don't drink too much.

858
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
I won't go to the bathroom if you're not here.

859
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Let's go.

860
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm so tired.

861
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
Don't look at me. I can't get up.

862
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Don't make fun of us.

863
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Wife.

864
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Wife.

865
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
Wife.

866
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
Are you asleep?

867
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,640
What time is it?

868
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,640
11 o'clock.

869
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Who is it?

870
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
I have a dream.

871
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
I can't wake up. I'm so sad.

872
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
Wife, do you want to eat something?

873
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,640
I don't have any energy.

874
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
So I have to eat something.

875
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640
I have to eat something.

876
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
Come on.

877
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,640
Let's go to the garden.

878
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,640
It's so cold.

879
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,640
After the surgery,

880
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,640
I'll have to wait for a long time.

881
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,640
I'll get you a hat.

882
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
It's not cold.

883
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,640
It's cold.

884
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,640
I'm done.

885
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,640
What are you doing?

886
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Don't worry.

887
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,640
I'm doing it for the sake of prevention.

888
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,640
I can't get this surgery.

889
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
I'll take it back.

890
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Even if it's a bad transfer,

891
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
how can I do it?

892
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
Can I talk to you?

893
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
I'm sorry.

894
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
I'm sorry.

895
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
I'm sorry.

896
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
I'm sorry.

897
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,640
I'm sorry.

898
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
I'm sorry.

899
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,640
I'm sorry.

900
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,640
I'm sorry.

901
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,640
I'm sorry.

902
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,640
I didn't mean to do this.

903
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
So don't worry.

904
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,640
I just want you to be a good boy.

905
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
I'm sorry.

906
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,640
My dad.

907
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,640
I should do everything for you.

908
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
You didn't tell me anything.

909
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
I'm sorry.

910
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,640
I know you well.

911
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,640
You've had a hard time.

912
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,640
I'm sorry.

913
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,640
I'm sorry.

914
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
I'm sorry.

915
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
I'm sorry.

916
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm so sorry.

917
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,640
I know you well.

918
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,640
You've been a strong boy since you were a kid.

919
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,640
You came here alone.

920
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,640
Your mom and I couldn't help you at all.

921
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,640
I feel sorry for you.

922
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,640
You're so smart and stubborn.

923
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,640
You're like your dad.

924
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,640
I don't know how much I've lost.

925
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,640
I'm like...

926
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,640
What if...

927
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,640
I'm not saying what if.

928
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,640
What if your mom doesn't care at all?

929
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,640
I know you'll take care of her.

930
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,640
But...

931
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,640
You...

932
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,640
You're alone.

933
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,640
Who's going to take care of my daughter?

934
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,640
I'll take care of her.

935
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,640
What time is it tomorrow?

936
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,640
It's the first stage in the morning.

937
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,640
Maybe the first stage will be better.

938
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Right?

939
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
Are you going back to my place tonight?

940
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,640
I won't go back today.

941
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
I opened a room in the hospital.

942
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
I'll take a look.

943
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
I have something for you.

944
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,640
I made some food for you.

945
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,640
It's your favorite.

946
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,640
You have to take care of your body tomorrow.

947
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,640
Or you can't take care of your health.

948
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,640
These are the ingredients for the recovery.

949
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,640
You have to ask the doctor first.

950
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,640
I'll go upstairs.

951
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,640
You're still in the hospital.

952
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

953
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,640
Is that so?

954
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Don't be so impulsive.

955
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
You should be.

956
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,640
You're a kid.

957
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm sorry.

958
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,640
Do you want to go up together?

959
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
I'm sorry.

960
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,640
I'm sorry.

961
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,640
I'm sorry.

962
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,640
I'm sorry.

963
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,640
I'm sorry.

964
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,640
The End
