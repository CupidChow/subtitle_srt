I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

I'm so happy to be with you

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm so happy to be with you

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm so happy to be with you

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so happy to be with you

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm so happy to be with you

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,780
WhatI will get from this time was Cuando

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:55,620
Corацион

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not going.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've been in class recently.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I work 70 hours a week.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I even write a thesis when I get home.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't sleep enough.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How can I help you?

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, this is really meaningful.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In the past months,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
we've found out that the spirit of the medical staff is great.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But we don't know how great the spirit is.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So we're going to teach these people

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the young doctors

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to see their growth experience

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and be confident and worthy.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Say it.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll owe you a favor.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please help me.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I failed the first task of the team.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's not appropriate.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right?

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Are you willing to let me go?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not willing to.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But I can't.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Eat.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Eat.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're going to have a meeting after it's cold.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm full.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you here?

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm here to ask you.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You don't have time to shoot.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You have time to record.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I...

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I've already made an appointment with Tia Tia.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Tia Tia has a fever.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She can't come. I'll help her.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's wrong?

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Tia Tia.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Tia Tia.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Tia Tia.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Tia Tia.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Tia Tia.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Here.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is this the one you ordered?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's the same.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How is it?

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's delicious.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I understand you.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There are three or four students in one school.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Only three or four of them can stay in the hospital.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The competition is fierce.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I understand if you don't go.

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But...

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Shouldn't you go?

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can attract the teacher's attention.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Right?

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Right?

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've asked you.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The strongest one is the two of you.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The one is you.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And the other is Liu...

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Liu Yiran.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, Liu Yiran.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Look, Liu Yiran is in the competition.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you don't participate, you'll be criticized.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Liu Yiran is good.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She often takes the first place in this class.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's normal for me to be criticized.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I find it interesting.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're so insensitive.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't you want to take the first place and stay in the hospital?

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Tell me.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why do you have to take the first place?

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why do you have to take the first place?

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why do you have to take the first place?

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why do you have to take the first place?

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why do you have to take the first place?

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm not sure if I want to take the first place.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think I'm already my base.

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I have to train myself.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
When I was little,

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
my dad took care of me.

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If I take the second place,

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
he would ask who is the first place.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I was trained to be a player like this.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to win every time.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I want to win every time.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Aren't you tired?

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm tired.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How can I not be tired?

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How can I not be tired?

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tell me.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're so young and so Buddha.

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why don't I believe you?

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I grew up with my old master.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They love me.

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They think my brother is so good.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't have to work hard.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm a doctor.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm a doctor, too.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For me,

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
this is my victory.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I want to win every time.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I want to win every time.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What time is it?

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's almost 10 o'clock.

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's too late. I can't get off.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's sleep here tonight.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll go to the car.

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're so tall.

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I won't sleep in the car.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Anyway, I have to sleep.

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's go to the car.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you...

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
so worried about me?

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Of course.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Your sister-in-law and I are related.

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're so mean.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let me explain to her.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She is the younger princess.

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sunwoo,

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Se Shap's her mother.

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Se Shap's her sister-in-law.

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It chapter 121 and the 122 mother.

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Full of concern.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't be delicate.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,260
Hi, Hong Da-li is around here.

161
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,460
What's that?

162
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,100
TV is very famous now.

163
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,200
flies always arrive.

164
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,160
This TV is not even possible

165
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,180
for more than seven years.

166
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,040
Let me have a look.

167
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,980
I really

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,700
think

169
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,160
you can pay more attention

170
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,500
on these questions

171
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,740
on the finalっちゃ in China gossip.

172
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,300
True

173
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,800
But you're the owner of the food.

174
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Why is it all her fault?

175
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Maybe the company is going to start a business.

176
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Do they think this topic is not popular enough?

177
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,200
I think it's normal to be popular.

178
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
And her weight

179
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,400
and your weight of food are completely different.

180
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
I'll leave now.

181
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Think about it.

182
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You're really good at acting.

183
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
You're so funny.

184
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
It's not easy.

185
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
You're so good at acting.

186
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Luckily, you didn't get a white coat.

187
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll leave now.

188
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
I saw her staying in the mountains that day.

189
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Who sent you back?

190
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Can't remember.

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
I'm thinking about it.

192
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
How should I answer some questions?

193
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I think you can't be too hard on yourself.

194
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't worry. It's still soft.

195
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
It's not hard.

196
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
I'll go get some food.

197
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Okay.

198
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I'll go get some food.

199
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'll go get some food.

200
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Come on.

201
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Get ready to shoot.

202
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Everyone, be careful.

203
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Everyone, get ready to shoot.

204
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Three, two, one.

205
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Shoot.

206
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Okay.

207
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
It's too much.

208
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Let's go to the 16th floor.

209
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Two more.

210
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Let's go.

211
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Okay.

212
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Go ahead.

213
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Du We Dean,

214
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
what we do is,

215
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
we've been able to drink 3 cups last month.

216
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,400
This is the drink that we serve to join him.

217
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I want to drink before he You can't keep quiet.

218
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,640
Is that right?

219
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
A nice friend?

220
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
It doesn't make any sense if he does.

221
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:48,660
Trust me.

222
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,040
You did that.

223
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,400
You shouldn't have done so.

224
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
What's up with other dramas?

225
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Step away from myième.

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,800
My mother continuated me to do this.

227
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
myself.

228
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,140
I'll set the scene..

229
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,840
No, you don't have to do it.

230
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,120
If you don't drink,

231
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm not qualified to talk.

232
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Master.

233
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
It's good.

234
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Brother Xu.

235
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Brother Xu.

236
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Brother Xu.

237
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
People outside say you're loyal to your loved ones.

238
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Just give me a face.

239
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
I won't let you be busy with nothing.

240
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I'll give you a face.

241
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
You're a good man.

242
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Let me do it.

243
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I'll do it.

244
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
I'll do it.

245
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
I hope you can do it.

246
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Wait.

247
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Let's go.

248
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
What's wrong?

249
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
What's wrong with him?

250
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay.

251
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
What's your name?

252
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
My name is Zhong Qingcheng.

253
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
You're the one who woke up?

254
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
It's me.

255
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Xu.

256
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
He's the actor.

257
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Brother Xu.

258
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Do you believe it?

259
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
I'm sure you can make a big change.

260
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
We can't be too big or too small.

261
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
You can make a change for us today.

262
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I'll give you back tomorrow.

263
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
You're the best.

264
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
You must have seen a lot

265
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
in this high and low-class scene.

266
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Who knows

267
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
which cloud will rain out of nowhere?

268
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
You can call me a friend

269
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,120
if you don't make a living.

270
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Are you sure?

271
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Your actor.

272
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
Okay.

273
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Good.

274
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
You're a bit shy.

275
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Okay.

276
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I'll take your sister.

277
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Three days.

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll pick up after three days.

279
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Okay.

280
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Three days.

281
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Thank you, Brother Xu.

282
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Three days.

283
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Thank you, Brother Xu.

284
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
Three days.

285
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
You should start to get dressed.

286
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
You'll feel better if you don't get angry.

287
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Who knows which cloud will rain out of nowhere?

288
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Who did you learn from?

289
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
You said you learned from Jiang Hu.

290
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
You learned from Jiang Hu.

291
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Stop laughing.

292
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Don't be anxious.

293
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Yang Yang, come here.

294
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Yang Yang, come here.

295
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
If you're sad,

296
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
let's just pass him by.

297
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
You know everything.

298
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm not stupid.

299
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
You're a fool.

300
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
You're like the guy who's been busy with Jiang Hu lately.

301
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
You're like a man.

302
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
You're not going to be the head of the team, are you?

303
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm not going to be the head of the team.

304
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
I'm not the best team.

305
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Forget it.

306
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
He's not just a boss.

307
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Let's find him.

308
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I think our project is good.

309
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
No one can be the head of the team.

310
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
It's okay.

311
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Xing Cheng.

312
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Come with me.

313
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I'm serious.

314
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,120
You know everything about me and my ex-wife.

315
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
I've been thinking about what I should do

316
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
to get back to you.

317
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
You don't understand.

318
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
But I think you're the one

319
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
you met when you knew.

320
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
You're the one who's been thinking about me.

321
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
You're the one who's been thinking about me.

322
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Why are you so serious?

323
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
We're not going to

324
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
work on the project.

325
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
You can go and work on it.

326
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I don't want to be your friend.

327
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
You've been so serious

328
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
about me for so long.

329
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I remember everything

330
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
that you've done for me.

331
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
But...

332
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
But...

333
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
We're really together.

334
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Can we make it through?

335
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
You know what?

336
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I want to go up.

337
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
We're so close.

338
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
We're so close.

339
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
You can call me if you want to eat or drink.

340
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
We can meet each other again.

341
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
That's so nice.

342
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
I'm so lucky.

343
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
We've been together for a whole night.

344
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
What's wrong?

345
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Okay.

346
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Okay.

347
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
From today on,

348
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
you'll be my friend.

349
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
You two

350
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
break up.

351
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
You're so mean.

352
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I'm so happy to see you.

353
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I'm so happy to see you.

354
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Come on.

355
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Dr. Fang,

356
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
go back home early.

357
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm coming.

358
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
If you're not sick,

359
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
they'll follow you.

360
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
It's not easy.

361
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
You guys are here.

362
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Please take the picture

363
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
and take a picture with me.

364
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Dr. Fang,

365
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
you're so sweet.

366
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm so happy to see you.

367
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
I'm so happy to see you.

368
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I'm so happy to see you.

369
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm so happy to see you.

370
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I'm so happy to see you.

371
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
I'm so happy to see you.

372
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I'm so happy to see you.

373
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm so happy to see you.

374
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
I'm so happy to see you.

375
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
I'm so happy to see you.

376
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
I'm so happy to see you.

377
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm so happy to see you.

378
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120

I'm so happy to see you.

390
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
What are you doing here?

391
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
I was...

392
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
I was at the back of the room yesterday.

393
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Why didn't you wake me up?

394
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I was supposed to wake you up.

395
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I was too sleepy.

396
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
I fell asleep.

397
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
I'm so happy to see you.

398
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
I'm so happy to see you.

399
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
I'm so happy to see you.

400
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Hello.

401
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
What do you mean?

402
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Is he going to leave when it's so important?

403
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Is he still human?

404
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
He can eat and not carry a gun, right?

405
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Let him go.

406
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Let him go.

407
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Let him go as far as possible.

408
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I don't know what's going on.

409
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I don't know what to do.

410
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I know.

411
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
I can...

412
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
You're going to break up.

413
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
I'm going to break up.

414
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I know.

415
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
See you later.

416
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Thank you, Mr. Kai Xi.

417
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll send you the message when you come out.

418
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Okay, thank you.

419
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
We're on our way.

420
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
See you, Mr. Kai Xi.

421
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Bye.

422
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
Bye.

423
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
I have no idea how I got there.

424
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Anything can't be confused.

425
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Is there anything on the road I should go to?

426
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
I've been called up by a person...

427
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
who said she was just waiting at the morning market.

428
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Okay.

429
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
I know what you are thinking.

430
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
How can you let me go?

431
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,120
I can't help it.

432
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
That's right.

433
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,640
Sa LeBS?

434
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,660
What's the big deal?

435
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,240
She can't leave makeshanocles.

436
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,400
In fact,

437
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,380
A™Y Another Outer Someone

438
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
centimet personality would be better,

439
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,880
Sihan.

440
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,320
I can't see them.

441
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,260
But…

442
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
Whatfeld feels when the last part is out of story?

443
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,900

448
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,980
,

449
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,180
Chen Min's company is going to be a hit.

450
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,840
There are a lot of rumors out there.

451
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,340
There are some problems today.

452
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,540
It's not a good thing.

453
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,940
She's under a lot of pressure.

454
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Actually, I don't have anything to say.

455
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,940
I just want to let everyone know.

456
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,140
Chen Min's company is not in trouble.

457
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,180
I can still wear the latest clothes and clothes.

458
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Hey.

459
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,540
Am I childish?

460
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,940
No, you're not.

461
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,140
I just think...

462
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Chen Min...

463
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,140
How can we be so angry with you?

464
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,540
I can be angry with you.

465
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,180
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,180
It's raining.

467
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,180
You should go home.

468
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,140
You should take care of yourself.

469
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,940
Take care of yourself.

470
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,740
Remember to eat every meal.

471
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Mom.

472
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,940
Here. This is for you.

473
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,140
This one?

474
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Take good care of yourself.

475
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,140
Don't come here again.

476
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

477
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

478
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,180

Chen Min's company is in trouble.

482
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

483
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

484
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

485
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

486
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

487
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

488
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

489
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

490
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180
Chen Min's company is in trouble.

491
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Is it annoying?

492
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
What's this?

493
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
How can I do this?

494
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,140
Not a good idea!

495
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,600
All right.

496
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,640
I'm going now.

497
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,340
I'll see you soon.

498
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Come here.

499
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,880
Come here.

500
00:33:43,180 --> 00:34:13,180

502
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
Take this and blow it.

503
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:48,180
Take this and blow it. This is good.

504
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,180
You've been practicing well. You didn't eat the egg white powder.

505
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
I also ate it.

506
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,180
Come out and blow it. It's too late.

507
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,180
I dried your clothes. You're welcome.

508
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
I'll blow it.

509
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Well...

510
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,180
That little girl is your patient?

511
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,180
Yes.

512
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,180
That little girl...

513
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Her old patient is ill.

514
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Her illness...

515
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
is not good.

516
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,180
She was in hospital at the time of the third and fourth.

517
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,180
At the beginning, her parents were still with her.

518
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,180
Now, she's on her own.

519
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,180
She's on the upstairs and downstairs. She's on the check-in.

520
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,180
She's a happy girl.

521
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,180
She's always with us.

522
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,180
She's also with the patient.

523
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
She usually lives in the hospital.

524
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,180
She's always with us.

525
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
You're so sensible.

526
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
How old are you?

527
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,180
14.

528
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,180
I went to the restaurant to eat.

529
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,180
I gave her a new cake.

530
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,180
I gave it to the patients.

531
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,180
I gave her one too.

532
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,180
It says in the package,

533
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,180
if you can only smile,

534
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,180
that's when you cry.

535
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
That's right.

536
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,180
There aren't many sensible kids.

537
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,180
They're all broken.

538
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,180
They're trained.

539
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,180
There aren't many sensible kids.

540
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,180
There aren't many sensible kids.

541
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,180
They're all broken.

542
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,180
They're trained.

543
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,180
There aren't any sensible adults.

544
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,180
There aren't many sensible kids.

545
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,180
There aren't many sensible kids.

546
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,180
There aren't many sensible kids.

547
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,180
The rain seems to have stopped.

548
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,180
I should go.

549
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,180
I'm home.

550
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Let's make an appointment.

551
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,180
Hello.

552
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
Welcome to the hospital.

553
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,180
Okay.

554
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Hello.

555
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Hello.

556
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Hello.

557
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Hello.

558
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Hello.

559
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Hello.

560
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Hello.

561
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
Hello.

562
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
Hello.

563
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
Hello.

564
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Hello.

565
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Hello.

566
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
Hello.

567
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Hello.

568
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Hello.

569
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,180
でも Kumoko.

570
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,180
Hello.

571
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
I'm sorry.

572
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,180
The doctor is tired, you're tired too.

573
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Don't mention it.

574
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,180
By the way, did Fang Chi talk to your cousin?

575
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,180
I don't think they have any feelings for each other.

576
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,180
They said that they want to work hard in the field.

577
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Fang Chi is like that.

578
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,180
He always introduces me to him.

579
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,180
It's okay to be educated.

580
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,180
But he's still working.

581
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,180
I don't know if he likes someone.

582
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,180
I'm telling you, don't be too considerate of his brother.

583
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,180
He needs to arrange his work and love.

584
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,180
He'll tell you who he is when he comes in the evening.

585
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,180
I don't know. He's his father.

586
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
Thank you.

587
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
Finally, you're here.

588
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
Sorry, I'm late.

589
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Here's your food.

590
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Okay.

591
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
Here.

592
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
I'm sorry.

593
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,180
I've been waiting for you for so long.

594
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,180
I can't help but drink the kind of tea that the elders have.

595
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
I'll have a drink.

596
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
Take care.

597
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Okay, okay.

598
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
You don't need to drink it.

599
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
You have to drink it.

600
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
You're a celebrity.

601
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
It's different.

602
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Take your time.

603
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
Drink it later.

604
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
Okay.

605
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
I'm starving.

606
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,180
I'm sitting there, just to accompany them.

607
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,180
I can't eat anything.

608
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
I've heard about the taste of the wine.

609
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
I've had a drink of the tea.

610
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,180
I heard that you've added the rice wine.

611
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
Add the rice wine?

612
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
What's the rice wine?

613
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
It's called the rice wine.

614
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,180
Mr. Chen's company has a problem.

615
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
After Mr. Chung went to the house, he solved it.

616
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,180
Who told you that?

617
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,180
The elders.

618
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
After I killed the gold,

619
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
I had no money to make a living.

620
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
Didn't Jiang Ya drag me to see the people?

621
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Just them.

622
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,180
They only drink a few tea to get used to it.

623
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,180
They can talk about anything in the South Sea.

624
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
They can talk about anything.

625
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,180
I heard what they said.

626
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
It's different from the past three days.

627
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
Didn't you like this kind of situation the most?

628
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
What can I do?

629
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,180
I've been to the house.

630
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
I've been to the house.

631
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
I'm not good at this.

632
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
Me too.

633
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,180
I'll call you later.

634
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,180
I was thinking about going on a show to blow the wind.

635
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,180
I didn't expect that people would solve their problems.

636
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
I'm not sure if it's funny.

637
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,180
Don't think too much.

638
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,180
It's good that it's solved.

639
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
Let's go.

640
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,180
The funniest thing is

641
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,180
I have to know this from the other person's mouth.

642
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,180
What do you mean?

643
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
What's wrong with my hand?

644
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
It's all right now.

645
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,180
You're here?

646
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,180
Don't ask why I have to watch you.

647
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,180
What's wrong with my hand?

648
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
It's okay.

649
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,180
Can you check it?

650
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,180
I'll be back.

651
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
I don't need to talk about this.

652
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Then forget it. Let's go together.

653
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,180
We're almost done.

654
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,180
Okay.

655
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
Let's dry it up a bit more.

656
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,180
I'll send you off.

657
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,180
No, I'll drive outside.

658
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,180
I have to go now.

659
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,180
I'll contact you later.

660
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,180
I'm going now.

661
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,180
Bye.

662
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,180
Bye.

663
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,180
Director.

664
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,180
What's wrong?

665
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,180
Dr. Lu.

666
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,180
The patient that was sent off yesterday,

667
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
I want to take another shot.

668
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,180
But Fang Chi doesn't agree.

669
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,180
Why don't you tell him?

670
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,180
Take another shot?

671
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Aren't we taking a record?

672
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,180
Why did you take a photo?

673
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,180
It's my mother.

674
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,180
You're the one who sent me off.

675
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,180
I'm sorry.

676
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I'm sorry.

677
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,180
I'm sorry.

678
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,180
I'm sorry.

679
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,180
I'm sorry.

680
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,180
I'm sorry.

681
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,180
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,180
I'm sorry.

684
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,180
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
I'm sorry.

686
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
I'm sorry.

687
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
Is that okay?

688
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,180
I'll bring it back to you later.

689
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,180
It's okay.

690
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,180
Let's clean up before we're home.

691
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,180
Jerry.

692
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,180
Let's go!

693
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,180
Get your part time jobs up.

694
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,180
Youра.

695
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,180
Get your spot.

696
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,600
한the

697
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,580
There.

698
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,580
There.

699
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,180
Go ahead.

700
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,180
The manager of the room said

701
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,180
that they only have one shot.

702
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,180
Are you ready?

703
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,180
They finished here.

704
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,180
You please leave quickly.

705
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,180
I'm okay.

706
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,180
Thank you.

707
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,180
We have to break a record of the report.

708
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,180
You're kidding.

709
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,500
You haven't eaten yet, right?

710
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,540
I've already ordered three bowls of food for you.

711
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,020
You should eat more.

712
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,060
You're so busy.

713
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,020
Or you won't be able to stay up all night.

714
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,580
I saw you this morning.

715
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,700
I didn't expect you to be so tough on me and the director.

716
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,780
And you were also treated by the director.

717
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,940
Thank you.

718
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,340
Are you recording?

719
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,580
You shouldn't have taken photos.

720
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,260
It's not just you. You should have changed.

721
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,020
It's my principle.

722
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,860
I thought we...

723
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,660
It's not a surprise.

724
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,380
It's not us.

725
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,740
I'll have to sort everything out for you, okay?

726
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,620
Okay.

727
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,020
The clearer the drink the better.

728
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,140
I'm grateful that I never seen a både you at work.

729
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,540
You didn't mention second equity or second wedlock.

730
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,700
I'm so sorry I can't asking your name.

731
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,140
Talk to you later.

732
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,820
I'll take you to the real one.

733
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,300
Give me the car.

734
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,740
Let me

735
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,740
This director's heart is too small.

736
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,740
He's only been torturing you for the morning.

737
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,740
It's okay. I'll go.

738
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,740
Sir, we have a documentary shoot here.

739
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,740
I need you...
