Open it.

6
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,600
Come on.

7
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,740
And the video.

8
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,240
Do you want to watch it?

9
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,940
I want to divorce.

10
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
I want to skip the nursing school.

11
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,940
Your half of the family,

12
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,940
including the company's share.

13
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,440
The

14
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,440
What do you mean?

15
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
What do you mean?

16
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
We're going to be in a hurry tomorrow morning.

17
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Ding Ding, get out of my house right now!

18
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
I'm going to be in a hurry tomorrow morning.

19
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Honey, what are you doing?

20
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Why are you doing this?

21
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I've spent so much energy on it.

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Why are you dealing with me?

23
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Honey, tomorrow is our wedding day.

24
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
We're doing well, aren't we?

25
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
We're doing well, aren't we?

26
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Don't you want to do something for yourself?

27
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm going to help you.

28
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Thank you.

29
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
You're welcome.

30
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Your half of the family,

31
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
including the company's share.

32
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Can I help you?

33
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Try the taste.

34
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
It's hot.

35
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,440
How is it?

36
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
It's a little more fragrant.

37
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,440
I added some roasted onions.

38
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Mr. Zhou, you're really good.

39
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
You've been away for three days.

40
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
You're very good at cooking.

41
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Mr. Zhou, you're really good.

42
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
You've been away for three days.

43
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Do you want to be together later?

44
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm sorry.

45
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
You want to do something for yourself, don't you?

46
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm going to help you.

47
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm going to call you back.

48
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Jin Cheng, I'm telling you the truth.

49
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I really want to be with you.

50
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Really.

51
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
I know you're worried.

52
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
I left a lot of money for her.

53
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,440
But I know that you're not sure about her.

54
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I think...

55
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I should be the one who's born for myself.

56
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I've misunderstood myself.

57
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Is that okay?

58
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
What are you thinking about?

59
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Is that okay?

60
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Have you seen the sweet-talking?

61
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
There's a line in it.

62
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Comrade Li Xiaojun,

63
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm not the reason you came to Hong Kong.

64
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
I'm not the reason you came to Hong Kong.

65
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Cheng Min,

66
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,440
we shouldn't meet again.

67
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm sorry.

68
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Did Zhong Qingcheng tell you?

69
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm sorry.

70
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,440
When did you become a wife?

71
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Honey,

72
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I admit that

73
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Zhong Qingcheng did divorce me.

74
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
But I refused him at the time.

75
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
I said it's impossible.

76
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Chen Kaixi and I are family.

77
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Can you be a family?

78
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Chen Min,

79
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
why didn't I notice that you were so good before?

80
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
You're a good girl.

81
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Don't say a little girl's heart.

82
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm a little heartless.

83
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Honey,

84
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
don't listen to Zhong Qingcheng.

85
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Do you know where you're at?

86
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
You're too naive.

87
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
He's a fool.

88
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
He can do anything.

89
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,440
He wants to disband us.

90
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
He can help himself.

91
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
He thinks he has a chance.

92
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Honey,

93
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
please don't hit him.

94
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I beg you.

95
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Calm down.

96
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
What's wrong with you?

97
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,440
What's wrong with you?

98
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Calm down.

99
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
When you were a woman,

100
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
tell me

101
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,440
which man didn't have a woman's love?

102
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Just a dream.

103
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
When you were a little girl,

104
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
tell me,

105
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,440
he must have been the one who seduced you.

106
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
When you were a woman,

107
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I told you

108
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
he was so beautiful

109
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
and handsome.

110
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Which man wouldn't have this kind of love?

111
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I did it

112
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
to

113
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,440
not let you two be together.

114
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm going to be friends with him.

115
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Do you know what it feels like?

116
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Not only he can't look down on me,

117
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
but also Luo Man.

118
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Even I can't look down on myself.

119
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Honey,

120
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm not a jerk!

122
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
I don't know what to do with you.

123
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I will never do it again.

124
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I will never do it again.

125
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Please give me another chance.

126
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Honey,

127
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm sorry.

128
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Honey,

133
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Honey,

134
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Honey,

135
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I know you're sad.

136
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I really know you're sad.

137
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
But I really didn't force him.

138
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
He really did.

139
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,440
You always ask me if I was being a jerk.

140
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I didn't! I really didn't!

141
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Because I love you.

142
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
What's the last thing that we have left?

143
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,440
The last thing that we have left.

144
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Love,

145
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
trust,

146
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,440
love.

147
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Honey,

148
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,440
please give me another chance.

149
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Tomorrow is our family's wedding.

150
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,440
We're still sleeping.

151
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I don't want to see you again.

152
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Honey,

153
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
rest.

154
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Let's start over tomorrow.

155
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Let's start over.

156
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I'm really sorry.

158
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm really sorry.

159
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I understand.

162
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
What?

163
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
You're not going to give me a high-five.

164
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
You're going to give me a high-five

165
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
that we can all be together.

166
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Right?

167
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Don't be silly.

168
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Happy birthday!

169
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,440
If you don't see anyone in person,

170
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,440
I'll definitely believe you.

171
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Just like before.

172
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
How did you do it?

173
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
How did you do it?

174
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
The second year of the company,

175
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
you signed this with Zhang Fan.

176
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Who are you defending?

177
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
The credit card.

178
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,440
You said you gave me 90% of the property.

179
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
It's quite a big deal.

180
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
But it's not even a share.

181
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
What do you want?

182
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I've been saying this for the first time.

183
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
I want to divorce.

184
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
I want to get married.

185
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
Your family is all part of it.

186
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Impossible.

187
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Luo Man is now with Zhong Mu Sun.

188
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,440
If you don't sign this divorce agreement,

189
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Luo Man will take Zhong Mu Sun's phone

190
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,440
and take this to the wedding ring.

191
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Can you knock this on the door?

192
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I'll go and see you.

193
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Hello, Mr. Chen.

194
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Congratulations. You've finally come to this day.

195
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Who taught you this?

196
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Who taught you this?

197
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Luo Man.

198
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Luo Man.

199
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Luo Man.

200
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Luo Man.

201
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Luo Man.

202
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Luo Man.

203
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Luo Man.

204
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Luo Man.

205
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Zhong Jing Cheng.

206
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
Chen Min.

207
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Before I met you,

208
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,440
I was also the only one.

209
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Did you forget that we were in the same college?

210
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,440
You've really treated me like a fool for so many years.

211
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Chen Min.

212
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Chen Min.

213
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Are you still you?

214
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Chen Min.

215
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,440
From the beginning,

216
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
you're no longer you.

217
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm sorry.

223
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I'm sorry.

226
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm sorry.

228
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I'm sorry.

232
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
I'm happy.

233
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm asking you one last time.

234
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Is this really what you want?

235
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,440
If I had 1000 words,

236
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
our family would be gone.

237
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Look.

238
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Chen Min.

239
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Chen Min, look.

240
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Someone's coming.

241
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
Let's go.

242
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Let's go.

243
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Xiao Nai Xi, you...

244
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Okay.

245
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Okay, Chen Min.

246
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Okay.

247
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Okay.

248
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Chen Min.

249
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Chen Min.

250
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
It's so late.

251
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,440
How about we stay here today?

252
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Go to bed early.

253
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
You can finish the night.

254
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Okay.

255
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
What's wrong?

256
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Maybe...

257
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
you're too good.

258
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm not used to being good.

259
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
It seems that you're lonely.

260
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
You want to fight with someone?

261
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
It's not easy to fight.

262
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Come on, let's fight.

263
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
I'll be with you.

264
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Okay.

265
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
You wait for me to pour a glass of wine.

266
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Pour a glass of wine and have a nice fight.

267
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
What are you doing?

268
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
I...

269
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
want to go back.

270
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
So suddenly?

271
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
It's already late.

272
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Suddenly, I have a script to write.

273
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
If you didn't write it with me, I would have done it.

274
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Next time.

275
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I'll be back.

276
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Okay.

277
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
How much money do you want?

278
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
How much money?

279
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
How am I supposed to pay?

280
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,440
What are you doing?

281
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
I don't care what you want.

282
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
You have to do it for me.

283
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Come on.

284
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Come on, let's drink.

285
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
It's too cheap.

286
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
I don't drink.

287
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
Let me see.

288
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Chen Kai Xin, you can't drink it.

289
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
It's too expensive.

290
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I can't drink it.

291
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
I can't drink it.

292
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
I'm going to celebrate today.

293
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,440
I heard a joke today.

294
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Why is the divorce expensive?

295
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Do you know?

296
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
It's worth it.

297
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Chen Kai Xin, you're not funny.

298
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
You're not funny.

299
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
I'm not funny.

300
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Come on.

301
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm sorry, you know that Chen Kai Xin is a little bit of a rabbit.

302
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,440
I don't want to know where she's going.

303
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I really want to see her now.

304
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Just like what happened that night,

305
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,440
how did she get so much hate?

306
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,440
And then Lisa, the only one who got so much power.

307
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
She has to have a script.

308
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,440
She has to have a script.

309
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
She has to have a big screen.

310
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,440
She has to have a big screen.

311
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Chen Kai Xin, you're so good.

312
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
But to be honest,

313
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
I think you're really good at making compliments.

314
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Why?

315
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
Just say it without exaggeration.

316
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,440
The script I wrote for our Xixi

317
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
is the one I wrote,

318
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,440
life is full of ups and downs.

319
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Right?

320
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Yes.

321
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Come on.

322
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Come on.

323
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
What?

324
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
To be honest,

325
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,440
if it weren't for you,

326
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
you,

327
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
you,

328
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
I wouldn't have forgotten.

329
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Jin Chen,

330
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,440
I know Chen Min has some connections with you.

331
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
No, I mean,

332
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Listen to me,

333
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Don't say it.

334
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
I trust you.

335
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I believe that you're okay.

336
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Chen Min must be on the run.

337
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Like the previous match,

338
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I didn't know there was her in that group.

339
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I was really dragged in.

340
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
It's okay, it's good.

341
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
You can keep talking to her.

342
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
I was really dragged in by him.

343
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
It's okay. It's great.

344
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Just keep talking to him.

345
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I've been a man for so many years.

346
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
I only have you now.

347
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,440
I hope you'll help me.

348
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm sorry.

349
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Just take it. Don't be polite to me.

350
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,440
You and Mr. Mian are so nice to me.

351
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm so angry when he's gone.

352
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I really want to have a fight with someone.

353
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
I told him,

354
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,440
look, I really did it.

355
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
But this man is only you.

356
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Zheng Kai Qi,

357
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
you're my starting point.

358
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
You're also my finishing point.

359
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Do you understand?

360
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Sister-in-law,

361
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,440
I don't understand business.

362
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
But

363
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
how much do you want to be a good person?

364
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,440
I want to be a good person.

365
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm leaving.

366
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
Bye.

367
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm leaving.

368
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
I'm leaving.

369
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
I'm leaving.

370
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
I'm leaving.

371
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Your husband's property is a house with you.

372
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
And you have a car and a savings.

373
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,440
You're now half of the amount of divorce.

374
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,440
If you want to earn a child's custody,

375
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
you're almost out of money.

376
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,440
But now you have this loan agreement.

377
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Everything is different.

378
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Since the signing time is after your wedding,

379
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,440
and both parties have not promised any financial separation,

380
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,440
I can give you a new agreement.

381
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Put all these shares in.

382
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Just look at you.

383
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
How can you let your husband sign it?

384
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
You have to be prepared.

385
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Your husband is a tiger.

386
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Tiger mouth is a lion.

387
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,440
This is a deal.

388
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
This is the bottom line.

389
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
There is no more money.

390
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
So there is only one chance.

391
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
You have to be prepared.

392
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,440
And you have to be cruel.

393
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
A person like Chen Mian,

394
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
he will definitely be angry when he wakes up.

395
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
So we have to kill him.

396
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
I have this decision.

397
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,440
If I have to kill him, I have to do something.

398
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,440
The first step is to get rid of his loan.

399
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Like Chen Mian, a big man who is too rough.

400
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
And he believes in himself too much.

401
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
And in his heart,

402
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
he is like a fool.

403
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Especially you.

404
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
You are just a loser.

405
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
You can't stop being a loser.

406
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
You have to get rid of his loan.

407
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Chen Kaixi,

408
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
you are my starting point.

409
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
You are also my finishing point.

410
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
My wife just said it right.

411
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
And don't be afraid of love and anger.

412
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
It will look so real.

413
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
One, two, three.

414
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
You haven't washed it yet?

415
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
I really have.

416
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
He is the father of the child.

417
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
What are you talking about?

418
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,440
You can't finish it early.

419
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Okay.

420
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
I will leave now.

421
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Only a few days left.

422
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Don't do anything.

423
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Don't worry.

424
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
I will tell you.

425
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
I will leave now.

426
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
When we wrote the script,

427
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
there was a trick called

428
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
the last minute of golden.

429
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
It means that

430
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
the biggest kill

431
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
will be executed in the last minute.

432
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
It's not a good strategy to kill him.

433
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,440
But this thing

434
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
needs to be taken out before the kill.

435
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Yes.

436
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
And it's the last night before the kill.

437
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
You and him, force him to pay.

438
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Two harm, one power, one chance.

439
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Your marriage and this part

440
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
are the same for him.

441
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
You have to force him to pay.

442
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
You have to pay if you don't.

443
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
What do you want?

444
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
I have said it before.

445
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
I want to divorce.

446
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
I want to jump into the adoption pool.

447
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
You can't

448
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
pay half of your life.

449
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Impossible.

450
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Can you knock this door tomorrow?

451
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
It's up to you.

452
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
No matter what Chen Mian comes here for,

453
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
I said what if.

454
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Because I am used to doing the worst.

455
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
What if Chen Mian

456
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
controls Kai Qi's case

457
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
and knocks himself out the next day?

458
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
You have the possibility.

459
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
It makes sense.

460
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
So we have to take a risk.

461
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Let him have some restrictions.

462
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
He won't come here.

463
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
restrictions?

464
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,440
What else can we restrictions on Chen Mian?

465
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Zhou Mousun?

466
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
He sent me a message this afternoon.

467
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
He sent me a message.

468
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Yes.

469
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,440
This is what Chen Mian is afraid of.

470
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Chen Mian is afraid of Zhou Mousun?

471
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
He is afraid of causing trouble.

472
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
This agreement is not fair.

473
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
If the boss doesn't report it,

474
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
he will be in danger.

475
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
He and Chen Mian will be finished.

476
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
I bet.

477
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Chen Mian will call Zhou Mousun.

478
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
And only one call.

479
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
So we have to make sure

480
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,440
that no matter how big Chen Mian is,

481
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,440
this call

482
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,440
must be a secret.

483
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
I understand.

484
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
What?

485
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
You have to send me a message.

486
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
You have to send me a message

487
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
that we can be together.

488
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Right?

489
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
You are so stupid.

490
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
The script.

491
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Chen Mian.

492
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Hello, Mr. Chen.

493
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Congratulations.

494
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
You are finally here.

495
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I can't think of anything else.

496
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Just like this.

497
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Sister Liu Wei.

498
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Is it really necessary to do this?

499
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I think this plan is too difficult.

500
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
We can't make a mistake.

501
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
If we fail,

502
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,440
I will be in no way out of this.

503
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
But, Sister Kai Xi,

504
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,440
you have to pay a lot of price.

505
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Xi Xi.

506
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
How about

507
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
we just have to do it as we like?

508
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Come slowly.

509
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Let's do it slowly.

510
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Maybe you can get what you want.

511
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Didn't I say

512
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
when we make this big decision,

513
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
we must be fair?

514
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Have you thought about it?

515
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Are you sure you want to do it?

516
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
If we fail, we will fail.

517
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't want to do it anyway.

518
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
You know

519
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,440
what I think about Chen Mian?

520
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Don't come here.

521
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
It's too late.

522
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
You can't do anything.

523
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
You are a good person.

524
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Help me find a way out.

525
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Hurry up.

526
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Just like that silly kid.

527
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I really want to know.

528
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I really want to know.

529
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
If in the end,

530
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
we win,

531
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
he will still look at me like a fool.

532
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Let's do it.

533
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
I told you.

534
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Look at my eyes.

535
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
They're like a ghost.

536
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
I don't want to watch.

537
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
I just want to know.

538
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
It's not a ghost.

539
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
It's not a ghost.

540
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
It's not a ghost.

541
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
It's a ghost.

542
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
It's a ghost.

543
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
I think...

544
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
I don't think he is my type.

545
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Open your eyes.

546
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Open your eyes!

547
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Do you have that kind of

548
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
feeling of being a big girl?

549
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Yes, I do.

550
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
You are back to work.

551
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Let me tell you.

552
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Today, I am a big girl.

553
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
I am a big girl.

554
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,440
I am a big girl.

555
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
I really don't dare to look at you.

556
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Just like this.

557
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
It's a very simple thing.

558
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,440
How dare you lie to those

559
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,440
men who are much more handsome than you?

560
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I think we are really

561
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
this kind of girl.

562
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
You are awesome.

563
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
But you should say it later.

564
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Maybe.

565
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,440
God, you are so shy.

566
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Give us a little bit of a break.

567
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
It's fair.

568
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
To be honest,

569
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,440
I really...

570
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,440
I am a little shy.

571
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
I am a little scared.

572
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
I am not in the middle of the night.

573
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
I am always in my dream.

574
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I know.

575
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
You are scared.

576
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
Do you know what is the scariest thing?

577
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
When I was listening to

578
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
that silly song with Zhou Muxuan,

579
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
I really

580
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
was so shocked.

581
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
I could hear my heart beating.

582
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
You know, I have to look at him.

583
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
I have to make him feel

584
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
that it is the past of the past.

585
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
And then I have to look at him and say,

586
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
these two hands can't be empty.

587
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
And then I have to take that phone.

588
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Do you know that?

589
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Let me tell you.

590
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
What?

591
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Your acting

592
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,440
is too dangerous.

593
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
No.

594
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,440
I have understood the truth

595
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
of the past.

596
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Dan Zhongjing Cheng

597
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,440
is such an easy person

598
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,440
to be an actor.

599
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
It's easy for you too.

600
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Because it's easy.

601
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
It's too hard, baby.

602
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Let's

603
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
walk one.

604
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,440
It's too hard.

605
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
This

606
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
is a great success.

607
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,440
This

608
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
is a great revenge.

609
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Thank you.

610
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
It's okay.

611
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
It's okay.

612
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,440
It's okay.

613
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
It's okay.

614
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
It's okay.

615
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
It's okay.

616
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,440
Thank you.
