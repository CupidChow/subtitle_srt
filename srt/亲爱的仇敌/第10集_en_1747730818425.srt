oh

4
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
You

5
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
You

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
You

8
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
You

9
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
You

10
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Zhong Xincheng

11
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes

12
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Come

13
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Director

14
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Do you know why you acted so badly just now?

15
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
You are his new wife, right?

16
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
He is a rich man

17
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
When he came in

18
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
He was holding his shoulder out

19
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
And his toes were out

20
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
His body language was exposed

21
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
And you were afraid of him

22
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Why are you afraid of him?

23
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
He won't bite you

24
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm afraid of him

25
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Since you are his new wife

26
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
You are the one he trusts the most

27
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
I

28
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
We let him stand there and lean on us

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
As long as you have a relationship with someone

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You won't have any problems

31
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Thank you, director

32
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Jiang Dao

33
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Why don't you tell me about the drama?

34
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
You should tell me about it

35
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
How dare I?

36
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
You are just a new actress

37
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
You are just a new person

38
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I can't tell you

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
The first step is body language

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Then

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
State of mind

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Relationship

43
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Eyes

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
When will you be able to do it?

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
There is no end to it

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Why do you have to start a fire when there are so many people?

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Do you really think you are a director's police station?

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Come

49
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Let's have a meal next time

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
And drink to death

51
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Start a fire

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The whole scene is broken

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Don't be afraid

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
No, no, no, you come and you feed me

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
How is it?

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I won't affect your shooting here, right?

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It doesn't affect at all

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
When did you come?

59
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Early

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
The 18th string actress is always on top

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
On top?

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
What do you mean?

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
It's

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
The first scene in the morning

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
And the last scene in the evening

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
It's all yours

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
You are not in the middle

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Then

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
You are here all day

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Waiting

71
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Staying

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It's okay, I'm used to it

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
And being in the crew

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
It's also good to learn

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
It's also good

76
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
We always joke

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Acting is something we like

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
No need to pay

79
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
What we earn is the money we wait for

80
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Then you are very optimistic

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
But it's also

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Look at me writing a script

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
It's also because I like it

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
What we earn is the money to serve the party

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Thank you

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Sister Luo Man

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Thank you

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
You are so nice to me

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Why are you so sentimental to me?

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
To be honest

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm just a sidekick

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
You don't have to thank me

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm not that big

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I mainly want to thank Director Jiang Ya

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Are you familiar with Director Jiang?

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
You two talk like a family

97
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
We two

98
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
At first we were not familiar

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Even

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
He wears some colored glasses

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Speaking of this, I have to thank Director Ken

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
At that time I had a script

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
And I handed it to him

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I said, okay

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Let's go out and talk

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
That one, have a meal

107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I said okay

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I thought I was talking about the script

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
When I looked at it

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
He set up a game

111
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
There was just a director in it

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Sorry

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Come on, come on

114
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Director Jiang

115
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Introduce to everyone

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Director Jiang, big director

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Everyone knows

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Sit down, sit down

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I won't introduce anymore

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Come on, come on, people are here

121
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Come on, come on, come on

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Come on, the first one

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Come on, come on, come on

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Come on, Director Jiang

125
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Come on

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Let me introduce you

127
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Luo Man

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
New friend

129
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Just started writing scripts

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Why are you still staring?

131
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Hurry up and introduce Director Jiang

132
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Come on

133
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Director Jiang, nice to meet you

134
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I just got here, you can go

135
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
You see me as

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Director Ken's little rice cooker again

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Director Ken

138
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Director Ken

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
You said you were going to add a handful

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Your project is too big

141
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
We are also bold and determined

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes, you see, there is pursuit and ideas

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
But the market is like this now

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Is not it

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
The so-called self-expression

146
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Still have to be more sophisticated

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Still have to be more sophisticated

148
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Since you are talking to me

149
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
What is it that we brothers can't discuss?

150
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
You do this

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You first help me to make the two big

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Protect the price

153
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Just say it

154
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Say you help me to break the project

155
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Free to do the supervision

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
How great

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
That's it

158
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I know, okay, let's go

159
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
The phone box is good

160
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Steel Iron Man, my son picked it up

161
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Certainly

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Don't boys like these things?

163
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
One day, everyone ran to me

164
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I said, dad, do you know Steel Iron Man?

165
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Can you take me to know someone?

166
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
We have the opportunity to cooperate sooner or later

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
A film

168
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Go to Hollywood

169
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Go to see Steel Iron Man together

170
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Do you have children?

171
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
A pair of twins

172
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
My wife is still in the US

173
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Luo Man, I'll send you back later

174
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
No need, I have a car

175
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Ha ha

176
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Sounds so expensive

177
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I said

178
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
How can I eat last time

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Chuchu is right for you

180
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I was also fooled by her

181
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I was originally staying here

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Pretty good

183
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
It's all because of her

184
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Now that sister Nina is always against me

185
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I said it is true

186
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Where is the president of the company is a steel stick

187
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Really

188
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Really

189
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
But I still have to thank him

190
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I don't know Jiangya without him

191
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
We will not have this revolutionary friendship

192
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Think about it

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
It was really hard at that time

194
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Let's carry thunder together

195
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Let's get scolded together

196
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Let's make a script together

197
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
You and Zhongsun

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Which step have you made now?

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Or is it your kind of date?

200
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I am with him

201
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
It's broken

202
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Broken

203
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I don't know why

204
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I always fight with Chen Kaixi because of men

205
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
But in fact we have never fought together

206
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
This is because of men

207
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
You quarreled

208
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
What's going on

209
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Why is there still something about Kaixi?

210
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I don't know

211
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Anyway

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I won't leave him again

213
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
This person

214
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Not close

215
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
What's wrong with you

216
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
You look depressed

217
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I

218
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I said it might not be appropriate

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
What's appropriate and inappropriate

220
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Say it

221
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Although Zhongsun has a hundred thousand new eyes

222
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
But I just heard you say

223
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
I think he said something right

224
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Is this his and Chen Bing's formula?

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Although I have never been on board

226
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
But you see me to audition

227
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Go to compete for roles

228
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
If others try it

229
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Isn't it not my business?

230
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
I tried this job is mine

231
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
That will all for an opportunity

232
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Discover Gu Hai and show off

233
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
That's the business as usual

234
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Zhongmunsun is not so ungrateful

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
But

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
He used Xi

237
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Yes indeed

238
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
But Zhongmunsun wants to kill that

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
What capital

240
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
He is not going to kill Chen Mian

241
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
His interests are the same as Chen Mian's

242
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Equal to his interests with Chen Kaixi

243
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Is the same

244
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
After all, they are husband and wife

245
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
They are a common interest

246
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
But wrong

247
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
He didn't consider my feelings at all

248
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm in the middle

249
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Then you have to think about it

250
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Have you considered him?

251
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I

252
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Work is work

253
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Feelings are feelings

254
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
He and Chen Mian are he and Chen Mian

255
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You and him are you and him

256
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
You don't have to mix together

257
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
You said this

258
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
I really make sense

259
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
But why did I hear it completely

260
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I don't know

261
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
I don't know

262
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
I don't understand

263
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
But why do I feel so

264
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Know

265
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Is it possible that

266
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I have seen a lot of things

267
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
His actions

268
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Also really broke my three-point

269
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
That's right

270
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Maybe this is

271
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
The grayness of life

272
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Different experiences

273
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Different standards

274
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I don't know

275
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Anyway, Zhou Muxun

276
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
With this bottom line

277
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
In front of me

278
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
There are 100,000 King Zong

279
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
What do you mean

280
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
You can understand

281
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Almost

282
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
But I think it's pretty interesting

283
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
You said Zhou Muxun

284
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Such a person who doesn't leak

285
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
How did it become so different from you

286
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I have

287
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Yes, very good

288
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
And he can say that

289
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
What is he angry about

290
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Why is he angry

291
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Which word offended him

292
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Mr. Zhang

293
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
These pages are just

294
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
The previous beauty

295
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
In the living room

296
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
This kind of thing

297
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Just throw it away

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
There is also a half-bag of sanitary napkins

299
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Throw it away

300
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Oh my god

301
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Chen Min, this ungrateful thing

302
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I remember you two were in love at that time

303
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Your parents are tight

304
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Not allowed you to go out

305
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
He always used me as a lie

306
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Invite you out

307
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
What did he say to me at that time

308
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Say me

309
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Yi Bo yun Tian

310
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Now it's okay

311
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
Now something happened

312
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Say I'm a villain

313
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Let you guard against me

314
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm just like

315
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Like a mother-in-law

316
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Stab behind her

317
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Cross the river and break the bridge

318
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
This crazy

319
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
What a villain

320
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Baby

321
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Sorry

322
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
If it weren't for Qingcheng telling me

323
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't know yet

324
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
You and Boss Zhou for me

325
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Fried rice

326
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
What's wrong with this thing

327
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
I'm going to do something small

328
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I think it should be

329
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
But to be honest

330
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
This thing is also a fire alarm

331
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Do you still want to be with him

332
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Ask so directly

333
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I

334
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
You just tell me

335
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Why did you guys fry rice

336
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Don't you support me and him

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I was with Chen Mian

338
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Everyone is against

339
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Only you support me

340
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Now you know he's a hole in the sky

341
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
You still have to jump

342
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
What should I do

343
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I'll accompany you

344
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Sometimes I fall in love

345
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
No way

346
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
I don't think so

347
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I didn't fall in love

348
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Don't laugh

349
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
I mean it

350
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Just a little bit

351
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
What do you say

352
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
A little bit

353
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Not content

354
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Not content

355
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
No problem

356
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
That day

357
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
I think

358
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
He's a little bit of a big deal

359
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
I don't think so

360
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
People say

361
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Hit people without hitting

362
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You are simply

363
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Press his face on the ground

364
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
What do you mean

365
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
You don't know

366
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Boss Zhou is relying on his former seven families

367
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Really

368
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
His ex-wife is called Yu Qiaoqiao

369
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Local people

370
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
The house is on the west side

371
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Do you know what the West side is?

372
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
They are both college students

373
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Married after graduation

374
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
About eight or nine years

375
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
His girlfriend died

376
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
After she died, they divorced about half a year later

377
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
It's not bad to be a little bit

378
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
It's said that he is a new couple

379
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
But the people outside are hard to listen to

380
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
It's hard to listen

381
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
He said he relied on Yu's position

382
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
He dumped Yu's position

383
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Being a person is too great

384
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,800
There are many people outside in the current situation

385
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
After all, it looks like Yu's family didn't make it difficult for him

386
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
But

387
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
People with this condition

388
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Do things very low-key

389
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Today's friends circle

390
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Make a good mood

391
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Come on, the city net ball

392
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Miao Zheng Happy

393
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
One hit

394
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
A little bit of a little star

395
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
The air follows the fill

396
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
All bought at Weiping

397
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
You can also go to the door for free

398
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Go to Weiping

399
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Search for your favorite big row clothes

400
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Buy three

401
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm going to the door

402
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Stop it

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Stop it, Luo Man

404
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
This man

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
The water is too deep

406
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
This mixed water is not for you to drink

407
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
You have to know

408
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Water

409
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
This water

410
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Deep

411
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
But it really looks like a mystery novel

412
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
This novel is so annoying.

413
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
This is Xiaobin.

414
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
At the beginning,

415
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
she can walk two steps.

416
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Let's see who's back.

417
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Dad!

418
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Slow down, son.

419
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Slow down, slow down.

420
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Okay, okay.

421
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Oh, my.

422
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
You're going to tear it?

423
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I cut it with my finger.

424
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
It was so scary.

425
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
I didn't even cry.

426
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
I've already sent you a video.

427
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
You're so brave.

428
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I'll give you a thumbs up.

429
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
The doctor said

430
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
you recovered well.

431
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
It's just that the plaster

432
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
is too itchy

433
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
so I changed a nail.

434
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
It's a little more airy.

435
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
I have a little fungus on my face.

436
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
It's a little stinky.

437
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm not willing to breathe.

438
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
You like the smell of the fungus?

439
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
I can't sleep at night.

440
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I can't sleep at night.

441
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
But I'm a very, very,

442
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
very, very very, very, very, very nice.

443
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Honey,

444
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
you've worked hard.

445
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Why are you so manly all of a sudden?

446
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
I'm hungry.

447
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
What should we eat tonight?

448
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Don't you have dinner tonight?

449
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
It's almost dinner time.

450
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
I'm hungry too.

451
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Then I'll have noodles with garlic.

452
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay.

453
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
But don't make it for me alone.

454
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Just give me a bite.

455
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Why do you always ask me to eat?

456
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
How is it?

457
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Is it good?

458
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
It's good.

459
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Why are you staring at me?

460
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm eating yours.

461
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
By the way,

462
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
there's a natural evening party the day after tomorrow.

463
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
If you have time, come with me.

464
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Okay.

465
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I didn't think it through.

467
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
I made you feel uncomfortable.

468
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
It's okay.

469
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I overestimated myself.

470
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
People have limited energy.

471
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
There's no balance.

472
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
But it's just a trend.

473
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
There's always a choice in life.

474
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
You chose your family.

475
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
To be honest,

476
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I think it's easier to manage a family

477
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
than to manage a company.

478
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
You can manage a family with a clear mind.

479
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
You can put your energy into your work.

480
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
You can make a good result.

481
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I'm not in the public service.

482
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
You're not in the evening party.

483
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
I feel that

484
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
you have a sense in the new consumer's world.

485
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
You have talent and a high standard.

486
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
If you want to start a business one day,

487
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
you can choose your own familiar track.

488
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,800
If you want to invest or other industrial wealth,

489
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
you can always find me.

490
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Of course,

491
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
with your Chen Mian,

492
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
you probably won't need me.

493
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Thank you.

494
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

495
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Thank you.

496
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Have a nice day.

497
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Okay.

498
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm going to the office.

499
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I can't change it.

500
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I can't change it anymore.

501
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I understand you now.

502
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Tian Ken is really Tian Ken.

503
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
You said he was fake.

504
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
He has a little bit of a needle in his teeth.

505
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
That word sounds comfortable and natural.

506
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Emotional value is given to him.

507
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I almost believed it.

508
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Actually, what he said is right.

509
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
You're enjoying yourself while eating and drinking.

510
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
You have a good taste, right?

511
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
I'm not.

512
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm not.

513
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm not.

514
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm not.

515
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm not.

516
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm not.

517
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm not.

518
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm not.

519
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I'm not.

520
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
You don't even know this round,

521
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
this cinnamon round.

522
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Then why can't I just say open the pot...

523
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I miss the old days.

524
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Yes?

525
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Ten equ Wasn't a hole there.

526
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
What's that?

527
00:25:48,800 --> 00:26:17,120
Your

528
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Maybe Zhong Wushu...

529
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I...

530
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Zhong Wushu is so low-key.

531
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Why is he so different from you?

532
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
How did you get into the school?

533
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
When I was in primary school,

534
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
I saw the high-rise building,

535
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
and I was totally mesmerized.

536
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
I was wondering,

537
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
how did he come up with this kind of building?

538
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
It was crazy.

539
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
So I went to study architecture.

540
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
No wonder you like Barcelona so much.

541
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
What's the height of the building?

542
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
The height of the building is the same as mine.

543
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,120
I always thought

544
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
it was a leveled building.

545
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
It was windy and quiet.

546
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
If I went to Barcelona again,

547
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
I would have a tour of the architecture room.

548
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
I asked the tourists to give me a good talk.

549
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
It sounds like I'm

550
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
quite good at tour guide.

551
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
I saved a lot of tour guide fee.

552
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
It's tens of thousands.

553
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I'm not cheap either.

554
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Mr. Sun, try this dish.

555
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Okay, okay.

556
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
Mr. Sun, give me a toast.

557
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Okay. Men from the age of 18 to 80

558
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
like the same dish.

559
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Do you like Chen Kaixi's

560
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
school-age style?

561
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Mr. Sun, I'm a man of my word.

562
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I'm not picky.

563
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay, cheers.

564
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
But,

565
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Chen Kaixi is

566
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
a beautiful and charming girl.

567
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Zhou,

568
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I'm curious about

569
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
what you think about

570
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Romano.

571
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I've known her for more than ten years.

572
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
She's talkative.

573
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
She's talkative.

574
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
She's just like her.

575
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Remember the girl you used to be

576
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
with a big secret every day?

577
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Where do you like her?

578
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
I think she's...

579
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
I just think

580
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
she's interesting.

581
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
This year,

582
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
we have 23 schools.

583
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
We have established 136 schools

584
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
in Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan,

585
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Shaanxi, Shanxi and seven provinces.

586
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
We're keeping our children's home.

587
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Thank you for your support.

588
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Thank you.

589
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
We have some problems here.

590
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I'm sorry.

591
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I'll take care of it.

592
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
What's the problem?

593
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
A big violinist is going to perform.

594
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
He can't be on stage.

595
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
I don't know where to find another one.

596
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Kaixi, aren't you a new violinist?

597
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Yes.

598
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,120
I forgot about it.

599
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Really? Mrs. Chen.

600
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Could you please

601
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
save the stage?

602
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
I haven't played for many years.

603
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
I'm sorry.

604
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Okay.

605
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I'll go now.

606
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Thank you.

607
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
The crab

608
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
should be served with good wine.

609
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Hello?

610
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Hello, Miss Luo.

611
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Mr. Zhou asked me to bring you wine.

612
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
It's hard to park now.

613
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
Could you please come down and get it?

614
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Okay. Thank you.

615
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Thank him for me.

616
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
I'll wait in the car.

617
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
It's not convenient to say something in the car.

618
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
Where's the wine?

619
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
In my house.

620
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
The crab is upstairs.

621
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
We have it in our house.

622
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
I'll go and get it.

623
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Okay.

624
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Thank you.

625
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Thank you.

626
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
We have it in our house too.

627
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
We just got it from Yangsheng Lake yesterday.

628
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
It's not fresh if we don't eat it.

629
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
I'll see you in the car.

630
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's none of my business.

631
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
I'll go now.

632
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I'll go now.

633
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
The city is amazing.

634
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
It's been 20 years

635
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
since I've been here.

636
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,120
The city is amazing.

637
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
It's none of my business.

638
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120

It's none of my business.

It's none of my business.

648
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
It's none of my business.

649
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
It's none of my business.

650
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
It's none of my business.

651
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
It's none of my business.

652
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
It's none of my business.

It's none of my business.

657
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
It's none of my business.

658

It's none of my business.

659
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120

Samkai

746
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
You can do it.

747
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
You can even do this?

748
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Some people say they want to eat it.

749
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
So versatile.

750
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
You know that?

751
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Then...

752
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
You're so nice to me.

753
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Is that a compliment?

754
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Let's talk later.

755
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Okay.

756
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,120
First of all...

757
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
I admit that I neglected your feelings...

758
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,120
when I was handling Chen Kai Xi's case.

759
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,120
But I don't want to hurt you.

760
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I'm used to separating work from life.

761
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
For me, that's work.

762
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,120
But we are us.

763
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Can I understand...

764
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,120
that you're apologizing to me?

765
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
So...

766
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Do you accept it?

767
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Yes, because I want to apologize to you.

768
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,120
I was a little emotional that day.

769
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
I had a lot to say.

770
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
So...

771
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,120
I'm sorry.

772
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Of course.

773
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,120
I can understand you.

774
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,120
I'm not good enough for you.

775
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,120
After all, we are...

776
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,120
dating happily.

777
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,120
Eating, chatting, and...

778
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,120
What do I have to say?

779
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,120
That's it.

780
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
I don't think you're that kind of person.

781
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,120
I don't just want to be like you.

782
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
Okay.

783
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
Our relationship...

784
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,120
is not limited to the bed.

785
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
We have a good communication.

786
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
We chat every day.

787
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
We eat together.

788
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,120
Our personalities are a part of our relationship.

789
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
How can that be considered...

790
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
that?

791
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
That's not a girlfriend.

792
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
It depends on how you understand...

793
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,120
the word girlfriend.

794
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,120
To be honest, I don't want to be...

795
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,120
too down-to-earth.

796
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,120
I have to tell you where I'm going.

797
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,120
If you eat with a man, I have to pretend to be jealous.

798
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I enjoy being like this.

799
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,120
I like to chat with you, eat with you, watch movies with you.

800
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,120
I have a fantasy of traveling with you.

801
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,120
But to be honest, I don't want us...

802
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,120
to interfere in each other's lives too much.

803
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,120
Can I understand that...

804
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,120
it's open-minded, not one-on-one?

805
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Right?

806
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,120
To be honest, I think that kind of relationship...

807
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,120
is unfair to you.

808
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,120
It's unfair to me?

809
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,120
Look.

810
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,120
We're both of different ages.

811
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,120
To be honest, the best company I could provide...

812
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,120
would be Gini.

813
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,120
But you're different.

814
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,120
When you're at your best in life...

815
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,120
wouldn't you regret not having a few more relationships?

816
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,120
I think...

817
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,120
we're both adults.

818
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,120
We know a lot of things.

819
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,120
The truth is, we don't dare to tell the truth.

820
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,120
Why don't we just tell it?

821
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,120
I noticed that you're under a new woman's shell.

822
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,120
You're at least wearing some traditional women's soul.

823
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Right?

824
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
You've gone so far.

825
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Then tell me...

826
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
what's true.

827
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
What's true?

828
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,120
It's true.

829
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,120
People...

830
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,120
don't know what they really want.

831
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,120
We're just used to...

832
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,120
the desire to control and occupy.

833
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
We see it as love.

834
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,120
Wait.

835
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,120
I don't think...

836
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,120
he's right.

837
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,120
But I still don't know what's wrong.

838
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,120
I might have to digest it.

839
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,120
But...

840
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,120
is this a high-quality P.O.A.?

841
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,120
P.O.A.

842
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
P.O.A.

843
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,120
P.O.A.

844
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
P.O.A.

845
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,120
P.O.A.

846
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,120
P.O.A.
