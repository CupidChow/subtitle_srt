75
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Let's go.

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Back then, I really didn't understand

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,000
Why all the people were

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know now.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Only a little bit of a mess

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
can face all these changes.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm serious.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My acting is still weak in my imagination.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The story is really good.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Don't drink too much.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Be careful of the top.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
By the way, is your family wine enough?

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If it's not enough,

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll ask Siqi to bring you over.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Qingcheng, listen to her.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't drink so much.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll bring you wine.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You asked me to drink,

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but you didn't let me drink.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You should drink better.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right, sister Kai is not feeling well.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have some wine at home.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you want to bring it over?

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, no, no.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Enough.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not a wine maker.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I just want to drink a little.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's really true.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Besides, I really

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
drag a small bottle every day.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I drag it up,

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
drag it down,

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and then I take the express delivery.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm so tired.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
By the way, Qingcheng,

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
did your group pay for the work?

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All the groups around me are not paying for the work.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I always said that I would pay for the work,

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
but I haven't opened it for several times.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's no way.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why do you have to do this?

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can't afford it now.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's really not easy.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I think

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
your fitness,

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
playing cards, and mental health are pretty good.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I've been doing it for several days.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you for giving me the list.

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I've been collecting it every day.

125
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Really.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want your list, too.

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And Luo Man,

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
don't hang up on the Internet every day.

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just like Chen Min,

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
he's so emotional.

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's so calm.

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's so weak.

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then,

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you should take some photos of Chen.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What?

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Take some photos.

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Take some dishes.

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wash and cut some dishes.

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What do you mean?

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't be too upset.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Just change it.

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's the one who's taking it.

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He keeps on eating it like an old friend.

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But it's okay.

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Just take it as a training.

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You really love him.

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can take care of yourself.

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're the only one

149
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
who can make a family meal.

150
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're the one who's working hard.

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm so thankful

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that he's not a mess.

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I made a meal yesterday.

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Someone said

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you should eat

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and have some buns

157
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and some lamb.

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But the three of them

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
can't be separated for a long time.

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What's wrong?

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's wrong?

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's broken.

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll hang up.

164
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Put the WeChat on.

166
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Honey.

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Honey.

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's time to go to the store.

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

170
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How about I go there?

171
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Forget it.

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We'll wait for the day

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and find the store tomorrow.

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Many people

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
haven't come back to the store.

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They won't come tomorrow.

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's just

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the thing in the middle school.

179
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll go there.

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll go.

181
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wait for me here.

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

184
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm fine.

185
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't worry.

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Remember,

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
please invite Dr. Fang

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to have a meal

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and thank him.

190
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't worry.

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will.

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But

193
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the restaurant is not open.

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's talk when it's open.

195
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I remember.

196
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Fang is reading.

197
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is she reading?

198
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think she is.

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What school?

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know.

201
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I guess it's a medical school.

202
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Dr. Fang

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is a good doctor.

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He is tall and

205
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
he is very energetic.

206
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You guys

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
are really...

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We have this kind of

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
normal thing.

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We are like you.

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We are all alone.

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You guys are so heartless.

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How old are they?

214
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They are only 27 years old.

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They are too old.

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are not old.

217
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Your cousin is only 3 years old.

218
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Isn't it good?

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You haven't come to the country for a few months.

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Please invite her to have a meal.

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Isn't it good?

222
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Your cousin.

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are Xiaoming.

225
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is Xiaoming's family anxious?

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Xiaoming's family is not anxious.

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's the problem?

228
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right?

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hurry up.

230
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll stop talking.

231
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let them add WeChat first.

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You are so sweet.

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I feel like blood sugar is high.

234
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No.

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No?

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You haven't been with her.

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Or you haven't?

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you want to ask me something?

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Tell me.

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What type of type do you like?

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't have one now?

243
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No.

244
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I like smart girls.

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Like the one in the bathroom.

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have a few questions.

247
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can ask.

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What do you think about the wedding?

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I mean...

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There is not a wedding now.

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not going to ask you.

252
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know.

253
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I have a few questions.

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What do you think about the wedding?

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you should ask.

257
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why don't you ask?

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why don't you ask?

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know.

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
you should ask.

262
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I mean

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
there are many boys who want to play now.

264
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If you want to play,

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you can choose whether to get married or not.

266
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can choose one step at a time.

267
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What do you think?

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What do you think about the wedding?

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't think about getting married.

270
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm just natural.

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Natural?

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Will you answer it so clearly?

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I find

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
although you are a good person,

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but you don't think that you are good enough to be a senior.

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My dad and my mom

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
are all praise to you.

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They are like flowers.

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Uncle and aunt are good.

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How about this?

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Give me a picture of you.

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Who are you going to give me today?

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My cousin.

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let me tell you.

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My cousin is a English student in college.

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And he doesn't like it.

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He wants to go to the law school

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and he didn't expect that he would be in the exam.

289
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He is smart and has a main sword.

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He is the type of person you like.

291
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Does your cousin look like you?

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He is a little sweet to me

293
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and he is a little cute to me.

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Anyway, he is the kind of person who is kind of sweet.

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He is not as big as you.

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I am not big.

297
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Talk to me.

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I am kind of sweet.

299
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I am kind of sweet.

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't understand.

301
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What is so big about being kind?

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I am kind of big?

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I am talking to you.

304
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I am telling you.

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Why?

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What do you mean why?

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There is something to ask for.

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You have to be a little bit more sweet.

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Besides, I am not good at your first impression.

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have to improve.

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Is it just your first impression?

312
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If you talk like this, we can't talk anymore.

313
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hurry up and send the photo.

314
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It is actually pretty good.

315
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I mean,

316
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the first impression you gave me,

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
it is actually pretty good.

318
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hello?

319
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Hello?

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Who are you?

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you don't talk, I will hang up.

322
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I am not talking to you.

323
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I am not talking to you.

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I am talking to you.

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you don't talk, I will hang up.

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Chengcheng,

327
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
it is me.

328
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to see you.

329
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you have time?

330
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Please enjoy.

331
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you.

332
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you.

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It is so delicious.

334
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It is so delicious.

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It is really delicious.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It is really delicious.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It is really delicious.

338
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It is the smallest and most dreamy thing.

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It is the most dreamy thing that I have ever made.

340
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I am almost crazy.

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Come on.

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Cheers.

343
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you.

344
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Thank you.

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It is closed.

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why are you still not here?

347
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I am going to the car.

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The 11th open.

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The whole city is closed.

350
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let me see.

351
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It is crispy.

352
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
How are you now?

353
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Do you have a script?

354
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't mention it.

355
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The whole industry is still pretty good.

356
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I found that my mentality has changed.

357
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know,

358
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
when I saw the money in my bank card,

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
my heart started to be a little crazy.

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But now, I think it is okay.

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You can still go through it.

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But you still have the loan now.

363
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you really can't keep it, tell me.

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Look,

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
there is a rich friend who is still pretty good.

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I admire you.

367
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's okay.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can still keep it.

369
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I have thought it over.

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If it doesn't work, I will continue to go back.

371
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Just write whatever you have.

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
My dad is the one who is fighting.

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How is it?

374
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He is feeling well.

375
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He is already blind.

376
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Guess who he wants to be with.

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who?

378
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Fang Chi.

379
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He will be the TTA.

380
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Before he met me,

381
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
he asked me to introduce him to him.

382
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Fang Chi is a very big kid.

383
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He can't even see one.

384
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He can't even see one?

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Fang Chi

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Talk with the young girl

387
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Where are you刑辰?

388
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't go to the maar ballet pool,

389
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
sorry.

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,680
The beasts that fight to win

391
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,660
Will the ladies with the more Państive

392
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,040
The most Spect Bin engaged

393
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,540
Will the girls who win

394
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,760
Will the ladies who have lost

395
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,560
The men in all the fingerprint

396
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,260
Faced like these

397
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,520
Entire scene is trerendo

398
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
How did this turn out?

399
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Still, bad mouth!

400
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,360
A round of applause!

401
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,120
They� rented a tiny blacklight

402
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,360
with a little rear-end at the back I mean the air really got between the back

403
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
The purple one

404
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
was also in the WeSch coupling

405
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
from the WePM Bank

406
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
A spot of open love

407
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,840
by the Shanghai WeTS

408
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,420
Those two were proposed by the stars

409
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,960
I was taken long ago after

410
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,520
to find out about the truth

411
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,200
So the result?

412
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
How could it be?

413
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,120
until you threw it in the air

414
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Then, he must be a little sad.

415
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,120
He went to his old friend's store to teach people to dance.

416
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,120
But you know it's hard for him now.

417
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Why isn't Qing Chen here yet?

418
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,120
He can't talk in the group.

419
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
He can't? Why?

420
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
It seems that the radio is not very close.

421
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Search?

422
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
My friend told me to search.

423
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
What?

424
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
What?

425
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
The woman is angry and wants to change her father.

426
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,120
But my life is not that bad.

427
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,120
It's okay.

428
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Then I'll come down and tell you the truth.

429
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm not a woman.

430
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
So you have to...

431
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
You don't have any money. I don't give you any.

432
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,120
You can go anywhere. It's your freedom.

433
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
It's obvious that he was picked up.

434
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Yes.

435
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
But the public opinion has been taken away.

436
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
The group is originally a group of people with the same gender.

437
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Now that he's out of the city, he can't tell.

438
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
What do you think?

439
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
He told me not to reply. They are here to deal with him.

440
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Then how are they going to deal with him?

441
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Just send a lawyer.

442
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
It's useless.

443
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Didn't Wang Lebo say that the lawyer is a 5,000 yuan test.

444
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
The more it is sent, the more it is allowed.

445
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
It's okay. We can think of a way ourselves.

446
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Yes, it can be solved.

447
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
My friend.

448
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
I thought...

449
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
I thought he was looking for me this time.

450
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
I thought he was getting older.

451
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
He could...

452
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
He could be better.

453
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Am I...

454
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Am I too stupid?

455
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Qing Chen, how can he say what he wants?

456
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
You have to say it too.

457
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
You were so young, he ran away with his wife.

458
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
It's been over ten years.

459
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Now that he's out of the city, he's got 5 million yuan.

460
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
How can it be like this?

461
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
It's not stupid. It's not like a dog can't eat.

462
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
It means you're kind.

463
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Call him.

464
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,120
He said he wanted to contact me on TV.

465
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
So he contacted a good person.

466
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
What should I do?

467
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Please take out these phones.

468
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Then you don't have to come in. Thank you.

469
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Close the door. Thank you.

470
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Okay.

471
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,120
I've already told you about the phone.

472
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,120
It was originally 5 million yuan.

473
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
But now I want 5 million.

474
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Now I want 6 million.

475
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I think...

476
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
I've been hurt a lot by the police.

477
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
And the disease is also in the family.

478
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
If I keep stealing it,

479
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
I can't even get 6 million.

480
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm your dream.

481
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
6 million.

482
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
What are you thinking?

483
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
You're thinking about money.

484
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Do you know what?

485
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
He's hanging on the hot search every day.

486
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Which quality film is he looking for now?

487
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Do you know how much we can pay?

488
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
6 million.

489
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
I can't even give you 6 million.

490
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Amanda, this is a public meeting.

491
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Calm down.

492
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
It's okay. I told you.

493
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
There's nothing to talk about with him.

494
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
He's just a little bit of a sissy.

495
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
What's the big deal?

496
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
We've talked about it.

497
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Sit down.

498
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Amanda, please sit down.

499
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Mr. Zhong,

500
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
we really came here today

501
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
to have a good talk with you.

502
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
After all, it's a father's life.

503
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
You can understand the illness

504
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
if you need money.

505
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Can you take out some sincerity

506
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
and make a good deal out of it?

507
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Okay.

508
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
4 million.

509
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
We can't make more.

510
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I'll give you 4 million.

511
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
You're a good man.

512
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Do you understand?

513
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
It's not easy to talk about it.

514
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Let's go.

515
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Let's go.

516
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
What if we do?

517
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
If you say so,

518
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I'll go to the show to talk about it.

519
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
The date is good anyway.

520
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
March 25th.

521
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
I'll eat some rice.

522
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I'll eat some rice.

523
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
You're the only one who's so greedy.

524
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I have to go to the show

525
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
to report you.

526
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Go.

527
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Hurry up.

528
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
We'll report you too.

529
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Uncle,

530
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
how can you abandon your son in the past ten years?

531
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Who's afraid of whom?

532
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Look at him.

533
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Look at him.

534
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm waiting for you.

535
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
April 17th is your birthday.

536
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
You're 50 today.

537
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
You're the 17th of April

538
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
at my age.

539
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
My mom and I left together.

540
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
After that,

541
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,120
my mom never loved any man.

542
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Of course, I know him.

543
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Because I don't dare to believe anyone.

544
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
I don't dare to say anything

545
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
when I'm wronged.

546
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm bullied by others.

547
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I don't dare to make trouble.

548
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Because I remember

549
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
my mom told me

550
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
that you're different from others.

551
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
You have no choice.

552
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
All these years,

553
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I just want to ask you one thing.

554
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
You've never

555
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
thought of me as your mom, right?

556
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
All these years,

557
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,120
you've never felt guilty, right?

558
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
You've never felt sorry for me and my mom,

559
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
right?

560
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Sorry

561
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
must be.

562
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
But...

563
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
So,

564
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
your apology needs me

565
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
to pay back the 5 million, right?

566
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
It's a matter of two.

567
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Now I'm sick.

568
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
I need this money to cure my illness.

569
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
It's not your illness.

570
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
And

571
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
I'm telling you,

572
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
after I'm on the show,

573
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
I'll be on the show.

574
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
I can't afford it.

575
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Waiting for the news

576
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Excuse me.

577
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Are don't your eyes are good?

578
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Yeah.

579
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Come,

580
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I'll help you.

581
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Your eyes

582
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,720
You can see a lot of movies in this drama.

583
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,160
Really?

584
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,680
I don't want to see so many romance movies.

585
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I just want to help myself.

586
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,560
I think romance movies are really good.

587
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,840
Kai Qi's movies are really good.

588
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,440
You just got angry.

589
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,480
Really?

590
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm afraid I'll wear too much.

591
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
I'll turn into a ghost.

592
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,840
How could that be?

593
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,960
The old white face

594
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,440
was taught by his wife.

595
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
You're so stupid.

596
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,600
You're so rich.

597
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
You're making her confused.

598
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,360
But that old guy is so mature.

599
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,000
He's a red-faced guy.

600
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,320
He's not a bad guy.

601
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,840
It's okay.

602
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
I didn't hurt her.

603
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,520
I've been feeling guilty for so many years.

604
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,840
You never felt sorry for me and us.

605
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Right?

606
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm sorry.

607
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
I must have fallen for you.

608
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,040
But...

609
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,240
So...

610
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,760
I need to pay you back with 5 million, right?

611
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
That's a good deal.

612
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,720
Mr. Zhou,

613
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
according to this film,

614
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,800
you've already made a living.

615
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,840
You've spent 5 million

616
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,320
on the film for 10 years.

617
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
You said you'd be happy.

618
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
The court is your family's.

619
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,240
The court is definitely not our family's.

620
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
It's definitely not your family's.

621
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,280
As for the law,

622
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,880
let's meet in court.

623
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,480
Right.

624
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,400
We've never touched this film.

625
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,680
As for you,

626
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,520
I remind you, Mr. Zhou,

627
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,000
technology is very advanced now.

628
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You can make mistakes when you delete it.

629
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,600
You've spent 3,000 or 10 years on it.

630
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,560
Music

631
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,920
Lyrics

632
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,280
Sign it.

633
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,080
미니к likely plenty.

634
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Cheap to death.

635
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Give me more.

636
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Just give me one thousand.

637
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay, Xing Chen, don't think about it anymore.

638
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay, I won't tell you.

639
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But every step of your journey is not easy.

640
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Remember, don't let your heart break.

641
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll tell you.

642
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You didn't tell Jiang that you sent me a WeChat message?

643
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I didn't tell him.

644
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You don't have to bother him.

645
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Which step?

646
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Which step?

647
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Jiang, I know.

648
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The job is very hard.

649
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
No, no, no.

650
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
No step.

651
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Really?

652
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes.

653
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't want to develop relationships and do anything.

654
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I just want to work hard and earn money and act well.

655
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Act well?

656
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Act like a woman?

657
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Act like a woman?

658
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Jiang is going to be sad.

659
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I understand that this is going to happen.

660
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
In this world, except for my mom,

661
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
you are the best for me.

662
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'll tell you.

663
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
How?

664
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
How?

665
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Now you say.

666
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So it's a fact?

667
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yes.

668
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'll make money.

669
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Really?

670
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No, no, no.

671
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
No, no, no.

672
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No, no, no.

673
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
No, no, no.

674
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll do it.

675
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'll do it.

676
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You're so generous.

677
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You're so generous.

678
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
No, no, no.

679
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Okay, I'll make money.

680
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll do whatever I can.

681
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'll take you out for fun.

682
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll take you on a trip.

683
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

684
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Okay.

685
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Okay.

686
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And you.

687
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
There are so many places you can choose.

688
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Why do you choose Lao Zhou?

689
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm familiar with places that are easy to arrange.

690
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Besides,

691
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
aren't you the most popular one there?

692
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Mom, mom, it's so dirty.

693
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Is it okay?

694
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Zhou Muxuan.

695
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, right.

696
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Zhou Muxuan.

697
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What's the relationship between Zhou Muxuan and Luo Man?

698
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oh, right. What's the relationship between Luo Man and Luo Man?

699
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm a big fan of him.

700
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
He's not good at gossiping.

701
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He's a good talker.

702
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't know.

703
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This is the kind of

704
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
friend circle that I often get.

705
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And then...

706
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I can't even count the likes and dislikes.

707
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That's the kind of relationship.

708
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Give it to me.

709
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Give it to me.

710
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Make money.

711
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes.

712
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Here.

713
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Make money.

714
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll give you a dry one.

715
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You sold your bag?

716
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You forgot to give me a flat.

717
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I suddenly found

718
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
a lot of things have been lost.

719
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
A period of desire and strength

720
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
has passed.

721
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And I

722
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
was completely destroyed.

723
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Hello.

724
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
A man wearing a musical instrument?

725
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Sure.

726
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Sure.

727
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
No problem.

728
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You can't count the likes and dislikes.

729
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Then...

730
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'll give you a piece of paper.

731
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
How much do they give you?

732
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Okay.

733
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'll think about it.

734
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Okay.

735
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Sis, I can't hold it anymore.

736
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
My friend is in a job interview.

737
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm afraid that if I go,

738
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'll have no time to write a script for you.

739
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's okay.

740
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Go.

741
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Don't worry.

742
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Go for it.

743
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Hello, Sis Duan.

744
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Say it.

745
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Did you find that

746
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
the doctor is a bit strange

747
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
about Fang recently?

748
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
What strange?

749
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Look at my resume.

750
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You said one sentence,

751
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and I said one sentence.

752
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I said one sentence,

753
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and he didn't talk.

754
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

755
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Isn't it too coincidence?

756
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But he didn't believe it.

757
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You don't like him anyway.

758
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Right?

759
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay, okay.

760
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You know it.

761
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'll hang up.

762
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What's this?

763
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Listen.

764
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This is my name tag.

765
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Three-touch-one-ring.

766
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Let me guess.

767
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Is there four-touch-one-ring?

768
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Five-touch-one-ring?

769
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Six-touch-one-ring?

770
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Smart.

771
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You're going to be so stingy

772
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
that you're going to be so stingy.

773
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm not stingy.

774
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You're going to be so stingy

775
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
that you're going to treat us to this?

776
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's delicious.

777
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But you have to treat me first.

778
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay.

779
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
When I'm done,

780
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'll invite you out for a meal.

781
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Okay?

782
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You.

783
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Honey,

784
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'll play with her for a while.

785
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I can't delay anything.

786
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You still have ten minutes

787
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
to go to the theme park online class.

788
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You can play online.

789
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't want to go to the theme park.

790
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Baby,

791
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
you can't do anything

792
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
without spending money.

793
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Honey,

794
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
she doesn't like it.

795
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Why bother?

796
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Besides,

797
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you can play online

798
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
as soon as you're done.

799
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
We'll learn

800
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
how to play it

801
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
in the future.

802
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
How can you teach a child like that?

803
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
In this way,

804
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
he'll learn everything

805
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and spend money.

806
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And at first,

807
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
he said he wanted to learn

808
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
how to play the piano.

809
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's a good thing

810
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to be a good teacher

811
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
when you're four years old.

812
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Besides,

813
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm almost 40

814
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and I often do things

815
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that I regret.

816
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Am I right?

817
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let's go.

818
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Chen Zhi,

819
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
stop right there.

820
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Honey,

821
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
you said it well.

822
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You should listen to someone

823
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
or I'll listen to you

824
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and I'll listen to you.

825
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And you're busy

826
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and you're on your own.

827
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Do you know

828
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
how hard it is

829
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to leave him?

830
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes, yes.

831
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Honey,

832
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I have to listen to my mom.

833
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I can't help you.

834
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Go.

835
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Let's go to class.

836
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'll give you a reward

837
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
after class, okay?

838
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Come on.

839
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay.

840
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Be careful.

841
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Be careful.

842
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Be careful.

843
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Okay.

844
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh!

845
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh!

846
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
What about you?

847
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You're alone.

848
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You're here to take care of me.

849
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I want to say something.

850
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Hello?

851
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm hungry.

852
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Why didn't you get up?

853
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Wait for me.

854
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,720
What a greedy couple!

855
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,160
Is he really this many people?

856
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,560
How's it possible?

857
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,360
Why have my subordinates come already?

858
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,860
Does that mean covering me up is too boring?

859
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,300
Let's not talk about the whole problem.

860
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,420
Did they really separate?

861
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,080
Yeah.

862
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,180
If it's really cats,

863
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,540
called the cat on the wheel,

864
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,260
said there is nothing between us.

865
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:12,260
We're sure to see a

866
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,900
cat who can't really hoof someone.

867
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,140
Brother, is it time to say that?

868
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,740
No.

869
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,420
You don't want to chase me, do you?

870
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,820
No.

871
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,220
No.

872
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,900
Where is this?

873
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,020
No.

874
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:32,740
Where is this?

875
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,900
It's a sudden discovery.

876
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Well, Doctor...

877
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,500
I...

878
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Fang Chi, what do you think?

879
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,100
The bed.

880
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,500
Then why does the bed cause the pain?

881
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,500
It's probably because the bed is too big,

882
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
causing the arrangement to be not singing.

883
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,900
The stomach is not caused.

884
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
Very good.

885
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Make a diagnosis.

886
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,500
I'm a very specific doctor.

887
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Doctor Wu Di An.

888
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,700
This patient, please lie down.

889
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Please don't move.

890
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,900
Take off the pants and put them on the knees.

891
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,700
It's good to be here tonight.

892
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
It's good to be here tonight.

893
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,700
Where can I go?

894
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,800
Don't move.

895
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,900
Over there.

896
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,300
Come.

897
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,440
Thank you.

898
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,440
You have been taking a nap for two days.

899
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,440
You often take a bath, take a bath,

900
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,440
and leave your work.

901
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Give me my phone.

902
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Please.

903
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Hello.

904
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Hello.

905
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Teacher Lu Man, why don't you reply to our WeChat?

906
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
We are on a date.

907
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
If you don't report, you'll have a fever tomorrow.

908
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
I just went to the hospital.

909
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
What should we do?

910
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,440
It's a bell. Who are you asking me to look for?

911
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
It's okay.

912
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,440
It's just three thousand words. I can write. Don't worry.

913
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Okay.

914
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
Okay.

915
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,440
It's all like this. You can still write?

916
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
I can.

917
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Please give me my phone.

918
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,440
You can say it. I'll help you write.

919
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Well...

920
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,440
The one I wrote may not be suitable for the oral surgery.

921
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Is it this one?

922
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
After seven years of running with the ball,

923
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
my father found me.

924
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
I'll give you my phone.

925
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Can this be published?

926
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Yes.

927
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
It's not only for the public.

928
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,440
If the reader has a need, we can satisfy them.

929
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
So...

930
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Can you do it?

931
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Yes.

932
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Okay.

933
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Are you sure?

934
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Yes.

935
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Let's start.

936
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Where did I write? I'll look at you.

937
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
I'll write it.

938
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
You start.

939
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,440
He said that the girl was next to him.

940
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Do you like me?

941
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,440
A man who is cold-hearted and has a bright face.

942
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,440
A man who is cold-hearted and has a bright face.

943
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
A man who is sweet and sweet.

944
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,440
He said that he likes that silly girl.

945
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,440
The girl said that she likes that silly girl and that she likes you.

946
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Only two words are missing.

947
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
What's wrong?

948
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,440
What you said is that silly girl.

949
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Is it?

950
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,440
A man who is cold-hearted and has a bright face.

951
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,440
A woman who likes that kind of thing.

952
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,440
The main character is a man who can't let go of his emotions in real life.

953
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,440
They like to see me write.

954
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,440
So you can do it.

955
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Okay.

956
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Okay.

957
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Let's continue.

958
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,440
The moonlight is like water and the sky.

959
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,440
The girl is like a sweet and sweet girl.

960
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,440
She is tightly stuck in the man's head.

961
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Think about it.

962
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,440
A woman with a thousand fingers,

963
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,440
she rubbed the man's ear.

964
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Then she went to the bathroom.

965
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,440
A man who is cold-hearted and has a bright face.

966
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Will you write it?

967
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
No.

968
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
No.

969
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Thank you for coming so late.

970
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
And for helping me with such a big task.

971
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440
How is it?

972
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,440
Do you have a new understanding of literature?

973
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,440
I know more about women's hearts.

974
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,440
I'm leaving.

975
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Have a good rest.

976
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
Thank you.

977
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,440
The documentary?

978
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Yes.

979
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
I'm working in the company now.

980
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
I'm going to the hospital to take the doctor's growth.

981
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
This project is very important.

982
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
I want to find a mature screenwriter.

983
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
I thought of selling you.

984
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Money is okay.

985
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,440
It's just that I'm a little old.

986
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
I have to live for four months.

987
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
Let me think about it.

988
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,440
I'm not sure.

989
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
I'll think about it.

990
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,440
How about I go back to the decision?

991
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Don't.

992
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,440
I'll pick it up.

993
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,440
I can start work anytime.

994
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,440
We have been looking at the selection of people recommended by the hospital.

995
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Actually, there is a young doctor.

996
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
He is very good.

997
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
The image is good.

998
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
The professionalism is good.

999
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
The problem is that he doesn't want to go to the show.

1000
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
We have looked for him many times.

1001
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
He didn't give up.

1002
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,440
What does he look like?

1003
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Do you have a photo?

1004
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
I'll look for it.

1005
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
I'll look for it.

1006
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
I'll take it.

1007
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Director, I should be able to make this person.

1008
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,440
I'm sorry.

1009
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,440
I'm sorry.

1010
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
I'm sorry.

1011
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
I'm sorry.
