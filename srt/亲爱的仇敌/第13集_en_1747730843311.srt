Oh

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Oh

5
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,880
Directed by gunmen

6
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,880
You two are so close.

7
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Why don't you introduce Li Wen to her?

8
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
She has a lot of resources.

9
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Just give her a choice.

10
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,880
What about later?

11
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Hmm?

12
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
How is the person who was looking for someone to take the exam?

13
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
He was fired.

14
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
And then

15
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,880
his family sent him abroad.

16
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,880
He was in a fashion store

17
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
to complete his studies.

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Now he's back to invest.

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
He's a good person.

20
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
He's a good person.

21
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
He's a good person.

22
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
He's a good person.

23
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
He's a good person.

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Now he's back to invest.

25
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
He's one of my partners.

26
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
Do you know him?

27
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm not shocked.

28
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I just think

29
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
people

30
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
will be punished

31
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
for their mistakes.

32
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
But some people

33
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,880
can start over

34
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
because they are too strong.

35
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
But some people

36
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
will lose that chance forever.

37
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
So do you think it's equal?

38
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Do you remember the day

39
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
we discussed the topic about the bottom line?

40
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
You told me

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
that

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
the person who broke the bottom line

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,880
was just a person with flaws.

44
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
was just a person with flaws.

45
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
That's because I know

46
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
that the person

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
who has flaws that you can see

48
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
is basically

49
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
an ordinary

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
but hardworking person.

51
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
And some people

52
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
you don't even have a chance to see.

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
So

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
So

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,880
you really look up to

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
those who can turn the wheel.

57
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Because you can see

58
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
yourself from them, right?

59
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
You're the same.

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Aren't you?

61
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
At least

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
we're the same.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Right?

64
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
This is the first time

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I've ever

66
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
touched

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
a place

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
deep inside

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
of his heart.

70
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
You're really

71
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
good at these things, right?

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Yeah.

73
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
I saw it on social media

74
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
and it was so cool.

75
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
It's amazing.

76
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
You're really good at these things.

77
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Right?

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
You're really good at these things.

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm serious.

80
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
You're not.

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
I'm serious.

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
I'm serious.

83
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
You're really good at these things.

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Forget it. Let's eat first.

85
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
The food is getting cold.

86
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Okay.

87
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Hey, Tianzhe.

88
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Is that Liu Liang from the movie you guys are watching?

89
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Oh.

90
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
I heard that his agent is a bit...

91
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Did you see it in the crew?

92
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
I don't think

93
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,880
he's that...

94
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,880
But his agent is really pretty.

95
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Really pretty.

96
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Let me see your photo.

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Here.

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
I have an idea.

99
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,880
What idea?

100
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
The netizens nowadays

101
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
use the time to watch videos

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
to entertain.

103
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
You want them to watch your video

104
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
for 5-6 minutes. How is that possible?

105
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
They haven't eaten braised pork

106
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
or seen yellow croaker, right?

107
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
So,

108
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
they're not here to watch your video

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
to learn how to cook.

110
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
They're here to see your lifestyle.

111
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,880
How can I have a lifestyle?

112
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
I have a

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
not very mature idea.

114
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
Don't you know a bunch of

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
crazy rich women?

116
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Every time you invite one of them

117
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
to be with you in this video,

118
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
you're crazy, right?

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm not interested in cooking.

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
But I'm not interested

121
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
in gossiping.

122
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
So,

123
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
is this a

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
series of food videos?

125
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
You're so talented.

126
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
You're a screenwriter.

127
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
What a pity.

128
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
But do you think

129
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
they're interesting?

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I don't think you like them.

131
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Because every time,

132
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm the one who's

133
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
being influenced by you.

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Of course, I'm not happy.

135
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I don't want to listen.

136
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,880
So,

137
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
this video needs a theme.

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
A popular theme at the moment.

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
As long as

140
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
this theme doesn't stop,

141
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
your video doesn't stop.

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I like this one.

143
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I'll choose from these two.

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I think Mrs. Gu is better.

145
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
I think Mrs. Gu is better.

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Why?

147
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
She has a lot of labels.

148
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
She's the most suitable for the rich woman.

149
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Look. She found a husband

150
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
who's 20 years older than her.

151
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
She's a low-class woman.

152
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
And she found a housewife

153
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
who has three nannies.

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
And now she has three nannies.

155
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
She's not coming.

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Who would be so happy?

157
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I think she'll come.

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
I know others think so.

159
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
But she doesn't have a chance to explain.

160
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
She doesn't have a chance to say.

161
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
People with labels

162
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
want to change their own personality.

163
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
She won't miss this chance.

164
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Xiaozhou,

165
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
you're very logical.

166
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Do you act silly in front of us?

167
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
What?

168
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
You're very smart.

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm not.

170
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm just a little hot.

171
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
I...

172
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Actually, I think

173
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
if Li Wei'an could come,

174
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
it would be a big hit.

175
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
It would be a big hit.

176
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Li Wei'an...

177
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Her story is so bloody.

178
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
That old woman is getting married again.

179
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Three marriages.

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
She's going to hold a wedding.

181
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
She booked an outdoor venue,

182
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
a western wedding,

183
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
and a jazz concert.

184
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
A western wedding?

185
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
The groom has to be engaged.

186
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Look at the men around her.

187
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
They're married, divorced,

188
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
old, sick, and bald.

189
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
It's not easy to find a full house.

190
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm so impressed.

191
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
The old woman gave us a invitation.

192
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
She'll definitely give it to Zhou Erwan.

193
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
You'll go, right?

194
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Don't pretend.

195
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
You've been...

196
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
so happy lately.

197
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Ask about other people's affairs.

198
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I'll remind you.

199
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Look.

200
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Come here.

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Come here.

202
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Are you tired?

203
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Why didn't you change your attitude?

204
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
What about him?

205
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Zhou was there at the meeting.

206
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
He called Luonan.

207
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
They were arguing.

208
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Zhou is so mature.

209
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
He's so embarrassed.

210
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
They're getting better.

211
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
They'll hold a concert

212
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
and be a couple.

213
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
They can still get along.

214
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
It's not a problem if they don't argue.

215
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
It's just the two of us.

216
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
We're not the same.

217
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Come on.

218
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Come on.

219
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Come on.

220
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
You'd better not go.

221
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Why?

222
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
I don't have to go.

223
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Why are you going?

224
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Good night.

225
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Okay.

226
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I'll watch a movie.

227
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Movies are not about life.

228
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Just think of it as

229
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
a movie about collecting materials.

230
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
It's a bloody movie.

231
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I really have to go.

232
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
I really don't want to go.

233
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I'll go.

234
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Go.

235
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
Okay?

236
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
You have business to do.

237
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Let's go together.

238
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Okay?

239
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
I'll be there

240
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
in the early stage.

241
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
There's nothing wrong with it.

242
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
There are so many people going to the wedding.

243
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
The producers and the director.

244
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I'll introduce you to them.

245
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Okay, thank you, Kai Qi.

246
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Are you going to the wedding alone?

247
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Yes.

248
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Chen Pian Yi hates

249
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
social activities

250
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
that require formal wear.

251
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
He hates to be with

252
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
these people, drinking champagne and pretending to be a socialite.

253
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Okay, that's good.

254
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
See you at the wedding.

255
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Come to my house.

256
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Let's go together.

257
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Let me see which one is better.

258
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Honey.

259
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
What are you eating tonight?

260
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I'm hungry.

261
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
I want to eat sweet shrimp.

262
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
If you think it's too bland,

263
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I'll make you something spicy.

264
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
If you want to eat at home,

265
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
tell me in advance. I'll prepare more dishes.

266
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Okay.

267
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Who are you talking to so happily?

268
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Luo Man.

269
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
We're talking about how to shoot a video.

270
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Okay.

271
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Okay.

272
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Okay.

273
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Okay.

274
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Okay.

275
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
After he's done with his work,

276
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I'll give him some fruit.

277
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
If I'm not back by tonight,

278
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I hope he can go to bed early.

279
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Okay.

280
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Honey.

281
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Wait for me.

282
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Didn't you leave early?

283
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Why are you still at home?

284
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Well...

285
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Last night,

286
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
you said that gossip.

287
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
I want to go with you.

288
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay.

289
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Thank you.

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Thank you.

291
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Hello.

292
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Here's your ticket.

293
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Miss, please show us your ticket.

294
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Here's the thing.

295
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Today, the venue is small.

296
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
The bride and groom only hope that their relatives and friends can come.

297
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Please forgive us.

298
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Thank you, Miss Liu.

299
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Your story really helped me a lot.

300
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
I've seen your play.

301
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
It's really wonderful.

302
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
I hope I can encourage everyone to pursue happiness.

303
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
I heard that you're going to have a wedding.

304
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Welcome to my wedding, Miss Luo.

305
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
It's a chance to witness the highlight of this story.

306
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
I don't know if this is

307
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
the pure love

308
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
after a man has crossed the river.

309
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
So pure.

310
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
So earthy.

311
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
So oily.

312
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Handsome, right?

313
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
When I first met him,

314
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
he was 19 years old.

315
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Nothing.

316
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
He wore a suit worth 200 yuan.

317
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
But I saw him

318
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
in the crowd.

319
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
The party of sisters.

320
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Cheers!

321
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
The meeting of the bride and groom.

322
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
The meeting of the bride and groom.

323
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
The meeting of the bride and groom.

324
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
The meeting of the bride and groom.

325
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
The meeting of the bride and groom.

326
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
The meeting of the bride and groom.

327
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Let's make a new look in the wedding.

328
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Put on the gentle powder.

329
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
And put it in the flower garden.

330
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
All good brands.

331
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
For you, dear.

332
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Search for your favorite clothes in the online store.

333
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Buy it.

334
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Honey, you don't have to go.

335
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
I just found a friend to be with me.

336
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
How did you know each other?

337
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
In the dance classroom.

338
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Xingchen is a famous actress.

339
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Our community?

340
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Honey.

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
You are really a great dancer.

342
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
How can you know each other?

343
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Yu Qiaoqiao.

344
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Zhou Musun's ex-wife.

345
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Luo Man, right?

346
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Hello, Miss Yu.

347
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Last night, Zhou Musun called me.

348
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
He told me his girlfriend would come.

349
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
He told me in advance.

350
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
I was curious.

351
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I searched.

352
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
I didn't see much of this.

353
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
We divorced.

354
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
And you still report to each other.

355
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Actually, no.

356
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
You are the first one.

357
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
No matter how close you are.

358
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
You have a sense of distance.

359
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
This strength is annoying.

360
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
But it's also attractive.

361
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
Right?

362
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
You two are together.

363
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Nine years.

364
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
He is nice.

365
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
He is good at managing emotions.

366
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I never saw him get angry.

367
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Last night, I told him.

368
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Since you are a girlfriend.

369
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Let's have a meal together.

370
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
He said, forget it.

371
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
It's annoying.

372
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
I never saw him like this.

373
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Then...

375
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Miss Yu, why did you tell me this?

376
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Maybe you find it strange.

377
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
But I really hope he is happy.

378
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
I was looking for you.

379
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I want to talk to you.

380
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm sorry.

381
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm leaving.

382
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Miss Zhong.

383
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Are you Zhong?

384
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Are you filming now?

385
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
I just joined the team.

386
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
I haven't been in a few days.

387
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Did the company introduce you?

388
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Luo Man.

389
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Luo Man's friend introduced me.

390
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
You know Luo Man?

391
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,880
This...

392
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
It's no use knowing Luo Man.

393
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Luo Man is just a small screenwriter.

394
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
Is it?

395
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
This wife...

396
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Since you two are so close.

397
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Why didn't you introduce Liuming to her?

398
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
She has a lot of resources.

399
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,880
She will be fine after she has a few.

400
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Liuming, you know it.

401
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
Very strong economy.

402
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Brought several famous stars.

403
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,480
I like a male celebrity with a long hair.

404
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,440
I have to introduce her to me.

405
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,320
That's how I met her.

406
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,840
Miss Zhai, are you free next week?

407
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
Do you need me to introduce you to each other?

408
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,800
Kai Qi has told me about it.

409
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
I'm still thinking about it.

410
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,720
Thank you.

411
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,800
Kai Qi.

412
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,360
You're smart.

413
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,040
How did you know I was coming?

414
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,720
I didn't know you.

415
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,720
You know me well.

416
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,280
Are you tired of being so busy every day?

417
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,440
Is there a requirement

418
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
from a video editor Guang Zi to be a celebrity?

419
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
Should you think it over,

420
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
how about using money to support your own work?

421
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,480
You're takie a snake to me he said.

422
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,480
The more expensive it is, the more difficult it will be for me.

423
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,960
Indian girls have good grades.

424
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,800
They only have 3-4 stars at night when they are traz completed.

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,120
It doesn't make sense

426
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,160
to give all my cuteness to a young man.

427
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
I feel embarrassed when I look at you.

428
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,080
You know,

429
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
No.

430
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Just laugh.

431
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I'm just happy with my bad luck anyway.

432
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
What do you mean by bad luck?

433
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,080
I can only say that Xixi is such a nice person.

434
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,080
If you don't want to say that you want to bring her out and get to know her more,

435
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
this kind of thing won't happen, right?

436
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Yes.

437
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
It's not your problem.

438
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Don't be self-conceited.

439
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Just laugh.

440
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Where's Xiao Zhong?

441
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Luo Yun Shang.

442
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
It's really you.

443
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
Long time no see.

444
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
How have you been?

445
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
I'm fine.

446
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
My parents have some business contacts with Uncle Fu.

447
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
How about you? Why are you here?

448
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
I came here with a friend.

449
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Friend?

450
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
What kind of friend?

451
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
A friend who just bought a ticket on the second-hand platform

452
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
and went to Ming Liu's wedding together and hung a card?

453
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
You too.

454
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
You had to break up with me.

455
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
I thought what would happen next.

456
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
How is it?

457
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Do you regret it now?

458
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
If you had listened to me and we got married,

459
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
you might be famous now.

460
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
Really?

461
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
I hope I didn't dump you earlier.

462
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Ex-boyfriend?

463
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
No wonder.

464
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Now, when you search for a girl,

465
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
you can find a girl who's a big shot.

466
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
You bought the Black Water Army, right?

467
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
The boy is not a big shot.

468
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
I have evidence.

469
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Don't talk nonsense.

470
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Stop pointing at people.

471
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Do you have a family?

472
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Look at all the women you know.

473
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
You're responsible for what you say.

474
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Say it again.

475
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Who are you talking about?

476
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Say it again. I want to hear it.

477
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Smile.

478
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Why are you smiling?

479
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
You had such bad taste.

480
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
You're right.

481
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Can you do it?

482
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
That's the one you said before.

483
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Yes.

484
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
You'll stand well.

485
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
That's the one you said before.

486
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Yes.

487
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
You'll stand well.

488
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I can't tell which is the groom and which is the father.

489
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
I'm not suitable to say this today.

490
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
It's so dirty.

491
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
A few angels.

492
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,080
I don't know if they really think that I'm in love.

493
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Mr. Fu Hongzheng.

494
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,080
You're willing to let the bride become your wife.

495
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
You'll live with her.

496
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
You'll be together.

497
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Love her, comfort her, protect her.

498
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Just like loving yourself.

499
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Whether she's healthy or sick.

500
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Poor or rich.

501
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,080
You'll always be loyal to her.

502
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Until she leaves this world.

503
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
I'm willing to be with her.

504
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Do you have any friends who are against their marriage?

505
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Wait a minute.

506
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Why is he here?

507
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
What are you doing here?

508
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Don't worry.

509
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm not against your marriage.

510
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
I'm willing to bless you.

511
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,080
I just hope that you can give my son back to you.

512
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
They...

513
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
They didn't let him see his son.

514
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Is Fu's father very rich?

515
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
The one who left his dead body.

516
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
He's so good.

517
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
You'll have your own child.

518
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
But I only have Chen Chen.

519
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
This is my son.

520
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
I can do anything for him.

521
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
I only want my son.

522
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
The child is so small.

523
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,080
The custody should be given to his mother.

524
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Do you still have conscience?

525
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,080
They got the proof of Li Wei'an's mental illness.

526
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
Don't come to me.

527
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
I'm going to make it clear to you today.

528
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't pull me.

529
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
It's a big day.

530
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
You have to talk to me.

531
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Give me a chance.

532
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
I haven't seen my son for a long time.

533
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Fu Hongzheng.

534
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
You should talk to him in front of so many people.

535
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
No.

536
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Li Wei'an made it like this.

537
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
What will the child do when he grows up?

538
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
What can the child do?

539
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
The child is too young to understand.

540
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
He can't choose.

541
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
But if he knows the reason, he will choose his father.

542
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Does he follow Li Wei'an every day?

543
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Li Wei'an.

544
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
To be honest, I didn't give enough money.

545
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
If I gave enough, I wouldn't have done this.

546
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
He doesn't lose anything.

547
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
He didn't have anything at first.

548
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
So he can't be a third party.

549
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
He should be punished.

550
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
He deserves it.

551
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Li Wei'an.

552
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
You know how I treat you.

553
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,080
We should be decent people, right?

554
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
What are you staring at?

555
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
Don't listen to her nonsense.

556
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
This woman has a bad brain.

557
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
She has a mental illness.

558
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,080
Li Wei'an.

559
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
You said I have a mental illness.

560
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
I'll show you what a mental illness is today.

561
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,080
I don't want to see you laugh.

562
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
You shameless men.

563
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
You took all my money.

564
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
Now you say I'm dirty.

565
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Who of you is clean?

566
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
How much do you have?

567
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
I want to go.

568
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
What about you?

569
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
I want to see it again.

570
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Isn't it a dream?

571
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
I tell you, the child is my flesh.

572
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
You want to stop me?

573
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I'll go with you.

574
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
You're all evil.

575
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Hurry up.

576
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
I thought you were different from me.

577
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
I told you.

578
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
You can't see me.

579
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
No one can see you.

580
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Let's go.

581
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Let's go.

582
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Let me go.

583
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Let me go.

584
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
You're all bad people.

585
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Let me go.

586
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Let me go.

587
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Let's go.

588
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,080
I was staring at the groom.

589
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
When it started,

590
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,080
I let the groom go.

591
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
Then I saw Li Wei'an

592
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,080
being carried away.

593
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Why every time

594
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
something like this happens,

595
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
it's a group of people who are hurt.

596
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
They are all injured.

597
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I'll go first.

598
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,080
I'll send you off.

599
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
What is it?

600
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Look at the hand.

601
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
Isn't it illegal to hit people?

602
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
I think we should send him to the police.

603
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,080
He'll be locked up for 10 days and half a month.

604
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Do you want to do something interesting?

605
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
No, I don't.

606
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
I'll take the car home.

607
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
Are you angry?

608
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,080
My friends didn't mean that.

609
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm sorry.

610
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,080
I don't know how you've been these years.

611
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,080
I thought you'd become a big star

612
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
and make a lot of money.

613
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,080
You know me.

614
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
If I knew...

615
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
How about this?

616
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Add me on WeChat.

617
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,080
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

618
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
Sure.

619
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Today.

620
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Is that okay?

621
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Sure.

622
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
I'll go.

623
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
There's a pervert!

624
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
No, I'm not.

625
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Don't go.

626
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Get in!

627
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
A pervert is here.

628
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Don't hit me.

629
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Come on.

630
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Don't hit me.

631
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Get in.

632
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Hurry up.

633
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Get out!

634
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Why are you hitting me?

635
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Why are you helping me?

636
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,080
I told you I hate this kind of situation.

637
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Every time, I'm hit by someone.

638
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
I'm always in trouble.

639
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Why are you hitting me?

640
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Don't hit me.

641
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Are you crazy?

642
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Who doesn't have a man who can easily beat you?

643
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Get out!

644
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
You're crazy!

645
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Get out!

646
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Get out!

647
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Get out!

648
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Get out!

649
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I said get out!

650
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Get out!

651
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
I'm telling you, Han Yihong.

652
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I'm telling you.

653
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
I'm telling you.

654
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I'm so crazy.

655
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
You have too much vision, don't you?

656
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Someone asked you to go to the bathroom.

657
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,080
No one is outside.

658
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
No one heard you.

659
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
The screen will be cut off.

660
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
What do you know?

661
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
I can show it to the camera.

662
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
It's called swimming.

663
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Okay.

664
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
I just changed our group name.

665
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Really?

666
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,080
It's called...

667
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
What's that?

668
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
It's so ugly.

669
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,080
It's so ugly.

670
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Drink some water.

671
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Are you a crew member?

672
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
You can listen to the voice.

673
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
What's wrong?

674
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
I have to make my voice a scene.

675
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,080
I'm so sleepy.

676
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I'm so sleepy.

677
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,080
I'm so sleepy.

678
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
I'm so sleepy.

679
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I'm so sleepy.

680
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
I'm so sleepy.

681
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
I'm so sleepy.

682
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
I'm so sleepy.

683
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
I'm so sleepy.

684
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
I'm so sleepy.

685
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm so sleepy.

686
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
I'm so sleepy.

687
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm so sleepy.

688
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I'm so sleepy.

689
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm so sleepy.

690
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm so sleepy.

691
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
I'm so sleepy.

692
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
I'm so sleepy.

693
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm so sleepy.

694
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I'm so sleepy.

695
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm so sleepy.

696
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm so sleepy.

697
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm so sleepy.

698
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
I'm so sleepy.

699
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
I'm so sleepy.

700
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
I'm so sleepy.

701
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm so sleepy.

702
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm so sleepy.

703
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm so sleepy.

704
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,080
The most beautiful thing when you look back

705
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,080
is to face yourself

706
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,080
and start over.

707
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I can see the moonlight clearly.

708
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,080
The wind that shines in the back

709
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:04,080
is a big theater in front of me.

710
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:10,080
The show is endless.

711
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:16,080
I can learn something from it.

712
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,080
It doesn't matter if I'm sad or sad.

713
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Life will always come to an end.

714
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Whether you're happy or not

715
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm thankful for everything you say.

716
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Let yourself be proud of that.

717
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:52,080
The pain of life is unbearable.

718
00:39:52,080 --> 00:40:02,080
How do you think it's not me?

719
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Thank you for watching!
