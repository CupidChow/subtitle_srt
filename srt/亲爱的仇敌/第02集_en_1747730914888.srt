5
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,720
I don't want you to feel sorry for me.

6
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Why should I feel sorry for you?

7
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Why?

8
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
What right do I have to feel sorry for you?

9
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
I'll take you to the other rooms.

10
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Okay?

11
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Hello, welcome to our new spring and summer four-piece meeting.

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Do you have an invitation?

13
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
No.

14
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Then I'm sorry.

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Our event today is only for the VVIP.

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
It will end in about three hours.

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Would you like to take a walk around and come back at five?

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,720
But you didn't say anything about this event in public.

19
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Luo Man.

20
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Baby.

21
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,720
This is my friend. Let him in.

22
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Please come in.

23
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Today,

24
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
this little line

25
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
and this one-step walk

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,720
make me realize that the gap between me and Chen Kaixi

27
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
is a red ditch.

28
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Long time no see.

30
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Baby.

31
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
You're a big screenwriter now.

32
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
The play you wrote recently is so popular.

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
My friends around me are watching it.

34
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm proud to tell them

35
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
that this is the best I can write.

36
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Okay.

37
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,720
You're so good at studying.

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
If it weren't for you,

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,720
I wouldn't be able to get a job.

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
You're not that bad.

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Really?

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
This cake is delicious.

44
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Try it.

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Okay. I don't eat chocolate.

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
I almost forgot.

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
I eat this.

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
That's delicious too.

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
You're usually busy.

50
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm not too embarrassed to contact you.

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
But you often put your friends in.

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm serious.

53
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
I'm your fan.

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
You don't usually post on your social media.

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
I wanted to see how you've been.

56
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
But I couldn't see you.

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,720
But people say that

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,720
the real happy people don't post on their social media.

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,720
So you're the real happy person.

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I don't have anything to post.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Look.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I got married too early.

63
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I have a baby.

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,720
I've been so busy all my life.

65
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,720
I've been busier these years.

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I wanted to get a job

67
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
and start a new business.

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
So I'm living here.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm doing the decoration

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
and helping Tia find a kindergarten.

71
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I finally got the chance

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
to go shopping.

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
My auntie is calling.

74
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Excuse me.

75
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm sorry!

76
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm not jealous.

77
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Fine. I'm jealous.

78
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm not jealous.

79
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
I just think...

80
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
she...

81
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
We...

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
You know what I mean.

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,800
It's like a tortoise running.

84
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
If the tortoise wakes up

85
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,920
and finds that the turtle is slowly

86
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
reaching the end,

87
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
the tortoise won't be angry.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,680
But if the tortoise

89
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,080
keeps running forward,

90
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,960
and finds that the turtle

91
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
is sitting on the back of the big swallow,

92
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,320
and falls to the end,

93
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,760
the tortoise will be a little upset.

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,760
That's how it feels.

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,040
And I am

96
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,880
the unlucky tortoise.

97
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,400
Baby!

98
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
It's done. Why are you bringing gifts?

99
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,720
That's it.

100
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
Come in.

101
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,400
Chen Kai Qi and I

102
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,520
seem to have recovered our friendship.

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,160
Every week,

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,560
he invites me to his house

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,120
to have dinner and tea.

106
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,800
And I...

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
I go to his house

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,120
every day.

109
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,320
Do you want to have a meal at my house

110
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,080
for dinner tonight?

111
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,400
Sure.

112
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,960
Okay.

113
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,560
Can you make me some

114
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
pepper, yellow croaker,

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
ginkgo, candied shrimp,

116
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,640
black pine nuts and beef?

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
Can you change the black pine nuts?

118
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
I just had dinner last night.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,560
You just had dinner?

120
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,720
Can you add

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
red corn,

122
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,320
high-end

123
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,800
and plain soy sauce?

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,880
That should be enough.

125
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:32,020
I changed the

126
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:38,700
for dinner.

127
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,500
Okay.

128
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,340
Thank you very much.

129
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,700
I appreciate it.

130
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,540
Absolutely.

131
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,700
They are all my favorite dishes.

132
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
So those are mine.

133
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,140
Hurry up.

134
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,700
Yes.

135
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,220
I have stayed home the most.

136
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,740
Thank you.

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,380
Wait.

138
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,380
I think it's interesting.

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,380
On the surface,

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,380
they are a group of people.

141
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,380
But in reality, no one is worth of anyone.

142
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,380
For example,

143
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,380
the rich dad

144
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,380
is definitely not worth of the rich husband.

145
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,380
And the married

146
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,380
is not worth of the married.

147
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,380
The most unappreciated person is this one.

148
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Don't just talk to yourself.

149
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,380
This is...

150
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
Luo...

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Luo Man.

152
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
Luo Man, do you always go to Japan?

153
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
I see the circle of friends.

154
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
Look, the photos he took are so beautiful.

155
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
I don't go there often.

156
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,380
I don't have that much money.

157
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
I just take a few pictures.

158
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Circle of friends?

159
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,380
I made my circle of friends.

160
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
I never post any photos.

161
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
I never post any photos when I travel.

162
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,380
I never post any photos.

163
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,380
I just want to have that kind of...

164
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
Cloudy scenery that I have seen before.

165
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,380
Do you understand?

166
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Luo Man,

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,380
let's go to Nanqing Mountain to shop together on the weekend.

168
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,380
Nanqing Mountain?

169
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,380
It's so popular. Can we have a room?

170
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Yes, there is one more room.

171
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,380
I can't sleep at night.

172
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,380
I have a date on the weekend.

173
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Yes, people are busy on the weekend.

174
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,380
Do you think it's the same as us?

175
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,380
Yes, we are just having a little party.

176
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,380
And my dear Chen Kai Xi,

177
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,380
he can't see my brother is not coming.

178
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
But he needs company.

179
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
He needs audience.

180
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,380
And I am the most suitable candidate.

181
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
Bye, bye, bye.

182
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,380
Bye, bye.

183
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Bye, bye.

184
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
Bye, bye.

185
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
Bye, bye.

186
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
Say goodbye to everyone.

187
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,380
I have no right to pity you.

188
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,380
Besides, he just went out for a while.

189
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
It's not a bankruptcy.

190
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
Am I right?

191
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
I have a little too much to eat.

192
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,380
I am a little full.

193
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
Let's have some Pu'er.

194
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,380
Where is your aunt?

195
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Can she make one for you?

196
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
I took a two-day vacation from my parents.

197
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,380
Chen Min went on a business trip.

198
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Tiao Tiao has an event in their class.

199
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,380
She is staying at the beach for the night.

200
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
I want to stay alone for two days.

201
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
I can't go to the beach.

202
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,380
I have to go to the beach.

203
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
I can't go to the beach.

204
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
I want to stay alone for two days.

205
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,380
Tell me.

206
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
How did you find out?

207
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

208
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,380
I found some records of big and small rewards

209
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,380
on his phone.

210
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,380
He thought it would be okay to install a dual system.

211
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
I'm not stupid.

212
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
I really admire you.

213
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
You can tell your husband's phone

214
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
so well-mannered.

215
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
You are a new generation of women.

216
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,380
I am a traditional woman.

217
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,380
We traditional women don't want to focus on privacy.

218
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,380
Then?

219
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,380
I followed all his social media.

220
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
I went to his dance class in France.

221
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,380
I met him there.

222
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Thanks.

223
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Darling, you danced so well.

224
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
I really think you danced well.

225
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,380
Thanks.

226
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
You dance better than Ms. Bi.

227
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
No.

228
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,480
You look like a paper

229
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
that I've learned for so long.

230
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Hello, I'm Chen Kaixi.

231
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Hello, I'm Zhong Qingcheng.

232
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Qingcheng?

233
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Wow, that's a nice name.

234
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
It's like the name in the novel.

235
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Qingcheng, Qingcheng.

236
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
It's a kind of cool and cool beauty.

237
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
It suits you.

238
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Thank you.

239
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
May I add you on WeChat?

240
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Sure.

241
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I'll send you.

242
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Okay.

243
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
May I ask how to dance?

244
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
No problem.

245
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
I'll put the fruit dessert on the table.

246
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Okay.

247
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
I'm going to be his friend.

248
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
At least,

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
I can introduce him to my boyfriend.

250
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Please come in.

251
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
Okay, thank you.

252
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I'll do it.

253
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Here you are.

254
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Welcome.

255
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Kaixi.

256
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Wow, you look so young and beautiful.

257
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I think

258
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
they might not be that close.

259
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
If they are,

260
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
they can just transfer the money.

261
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Why do they need to go to the platform to get a reward?

262
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
They need to get a part of the money from the platform.

263
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Chen Mian is so smart.

264
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
It's not that bad.

265
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,480
We've seen him several times.

266
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
He only has a few hundred pieces of clothing.

267
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
It shows that

268
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Chen Mian hasn't spent a lot of money on him.

269
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
It's not for real.

270
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Chen Mian said

271
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
money is attitude.

272
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,480
He's willing to spend 40,000 yuan for him for a month.

273
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
He's for real.

274
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
It's not worth it to spend so much money on your husband.

275
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
That's your attitude.

276
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,480
I can't bear to spend so much money on him.

277
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Tell me,

278
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
what's your bottom line?

279
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
It's hard.

280
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
If you want to buy a bag,

281
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
you can't be serious.

282
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
It doesn't matter.

283
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
You can't buy a house.

284
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
What if this woman doesn't want her money,

285
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
but her true love?

286
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
What about your true love?

287
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
What true love?

288
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
40,000 yuan.

289
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
40,000 yuan is a lot of money to me.

290
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
For your Mr. Chen,

291
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
a cup of tea and a bottle of wine

292
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
are worth tens of thousands of yuan.

293
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
40,000 yuan.

294
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
That's a lot.

295
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,480
It's a big difference between spending money on yourself and others.

296
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
What do you mean?

297
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Chen Mian also had a bad account last year.

298
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,480
The Valentine's gift he gave out

299
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
was a gift card he gave him.

300
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
500 yuan for one card.

301
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
He gave four cards.

302
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Four cards.

303
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
This is something

304
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I can think of when I bite my teeth.

305
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
So do you know

306
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
why I'm scared now?

307
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
I think you don't have anything to be afraid of.

308
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Really.

309
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I think Zhong Qingcheng looks smart.

310
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
You just occasionally

311
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
talk to him.

312
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
I think he'll understand

313
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
and will give in.

314
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
By then,

315
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
no matter what Chen Mian wants to do,

316
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
he won't be able to do anything.

317
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
What do you think?

318
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Don't worry.

319
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
It's 12 o'clock.

320
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm going to bed.

321
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Just sleep here.

322
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
The guest room's bed sheets are new.

323
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
I have to go to work tomorrow.

324
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
I have an important meeting at 9 o'clock.

325
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Look.

326
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
You're much happier than me.

327
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
At least you don't worry about eating or drinking.

328
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Unlike me,

329
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm more and more

330
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
a hardworking person

331
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
who takes care of my hair

332
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
and makes a little money.

333
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
What do you call this kind of pain?

334
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
It's called

335
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,480
the feeling of being called a husband and wife.

336
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm talking about you.

337
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I lied.

338
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
I've never been so lucky.

339
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I have this job.

340
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
I rely on my own hands.

341
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
At least

342
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
my efforts won't betray me.

343
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,480
I don't have to be afraid of the situation every day.

344
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Xixi.

346
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
What's wrong?

347
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
What's wrong?

348
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
It's okay. Cry it out.

349
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
It's okay. Cry it out.

350
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Chen Kaixi

351
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
is still the Chen Kaixi I knew.

352
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
He didn't change.

353
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm busy.

355
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
No, Tong Yuan.

356
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
I just want to...

357
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

358
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I just want to ask

359
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
if the girl who played the violin

360
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
is from your dorm.

361
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
What's her name?

362
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
I'll ask you myself.

363
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm from the Specialty Department of the National University of Art.

365
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Only a few specialists

366
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
from the Art Department can choose.

367
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
My mom said Chinese is the most popular and the most suitable for me.

368
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
So I came.

369
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Didn't you think about finding a job after graduation?

370
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
That's four years later.

371
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
You should graduate first.

372
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
Next week, the department invited the famous screenwriter,

373
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Mr. Xu Lan, to give a lecture on the topic.

374
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
We need a classmate to take over.

375
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Who is qualified to take on the role?

376
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Luo Man.

377
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
Okay.

378
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Instructing planning and our artistic style.

379
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,480
For example, in a good script,

380
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
there are several important elements.

381
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
A narrative person, a narrative method,

382
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
and our narrative rhythm and its language.

383
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Go ahead, dear.

384
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
When we write a good script,

385
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
we must think about its content.

386
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Dear friends, listen to me.

387
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I know you think I don't deserve Chen Kai Qi.

388
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Yes!

389
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Yes!

390
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
I don't deserve him!

391
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
It's true.

392
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I really don't deserve him.

393
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
But I, Chen Mian,

394
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I am a lucky man.

395
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
The greatest blessing in my life

396
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
is to marry Chen Kai Qi.

397
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Good!

398
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Hong Yi!

399
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Here!

400
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
In front of you,

401
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I swear to God

402
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,480
that I will love Chen Kai Qi for the rest of my life.

403
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I will treat him well,

404
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
try my best to treat him well,

405
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
and try my best to let him live a good life.

406
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Yes!

407
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Good!

408
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Why do we have to live in such a happy day?

409
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Then you should kiss him!

410
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Yes!

411
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Kiss him! Kiss him!

412
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Kiss him! Kiss him!

413
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Kiss him! Kiss him!

414
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Kiss him! Kiss him!

415
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Kiss him!

416
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
I can only feel bad.

417
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,480
I didn't marry him for money.

418
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
When I married him,

419
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
he was nothing.

420
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Our family was so against it.

421
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
It was me.

422
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
I was determined to follow him.

423
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
I said I was not afraid of suffering.

424
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
But...

425
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Do you know something, Su Ban?

426
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
When I was young,

427
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
I was born in the South.

428
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
I was in the South.

429
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
I was 29 years old.

430
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
The doctor came in and told me

431
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
that if I didn't get the vaccine,

432
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I would be in danger.

433
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
I was in the hospital.

434
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
I know what you think.

435
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I spent all my money on the lottery.

436
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I really did everything for this family.

437
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Don't cry.

438
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Don't cry.

439
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
He told me that he loved me.

440
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
He said so many times.

441
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Why did it become like this?

442
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Why does the producer like to send 60 seconds of information?

444
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Okay, Mr. Ning.

445
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,480
How about we talk about it in detail tomorrow at the script meeting?

446
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Now I know that

447
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
we are all the same.

448
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
But...

449
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I don't know what to do.

450
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I don't know what to do.

451
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
The work that Chen Kaixi did is called

452
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Mrs. Chen.

453
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
What are you doing?

454
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm doing the research.

455
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
It's 1.30 p.m.

456
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
It's not strange.

457
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
It's just that the opening is

458
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
a little interesting.

459
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Are you asleep?

460
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
No.

461
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
What's wrong?

462
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I'll show you something interesting.

463
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Please pay attention to it.

464
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
The sky is moving.

465
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
It's just that

466
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,480
the opening is a little too plain.

467
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Don't tell him that you just told me.

468
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
And baby,

469
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Zhou Musheng is a jerk.

470
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
He's a woman who's always trying to win her heart.

471
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
If you really want to get married,

472
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
just stay away from him.

473
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Don't worry.

474
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
You know what I mean.

475
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
It's best.

476
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Then...

477
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Thank you.

478
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
You can call me whatever you want.

479
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
I'll call you later.

480
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
I just took a shower.

481
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I have a meeting at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

482
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Good night.

483
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Good night.

484
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Good night.

485
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
The sky is moving.

486
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,480
But this kind of difficult test

487
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
is not easy.

488
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
So we think

489
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
if we turn this man's character

490
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,480
from Prince White Horse to White Horse Knight,

491
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
it will be more logical

492
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
than the whole script.

493
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Stop. Stop. Stop.

494
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Don't talk.

495
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Do you scriptwriters

496
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,480
know the location of the play?

497
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Do you attract the audience by logic?

498
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
You are the ones who write sweet and lovely.

499
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
That's why I'm looking for you.

500
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Will I look for you

501
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
if I win the Bai Yunlan Award?

502
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Ning.

503
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
How about a ten-minute break?

504
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Thank you. Have some tea.

505
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Thank you.

506
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
You're welcome.

507
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Hello.

508
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
What's wrong, Su?

509
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
I'm sorry.

510
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I'm sorry.

511
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
I'm sorry.

513
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
I'm sorry.

514
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
I'm sorry.

515
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
What's wrong, Su?

516
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Are you still in the meeting?

517
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
It's nine o'clock in the morning.

518
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
It's five o'clock now.

519
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
The script meeting

520
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
is supposed to be held all day long.

521
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
What do you think?

522
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
But today is special.

523
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
I was scolded all day long today.

524
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
How about it?

525
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Do you understand

526
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
more about your brother-in-law now?

527
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
I'm busy, too.

528
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
I send Qiao Qiao to school in the morning.

529
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
I have to plant flowers and cook when I come back.

530
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
I have to go to the airport and drop off school later.

531
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Everyone has to take care of their children

532
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
and cook, okay?

533
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
My current treatment is really...

534
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
It's not easy to live a year.

535
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
The way he talks to me

536
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
is like a rich assistant.

537
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,480
I'm not like my mother.

538
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Don't joke around.

539
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
How about I write a resignation letter for you?

540
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Luo Man, which side are you on?

541
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
You...

542
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Sister, it's time to eat.

543
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
I know.

544
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
I'm going to the massage.

545
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Is there anything else?

546
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Wait.

547
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
I have a emotional counseling class.

548
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Can you go to pick up the teacher with me tomorrow?

549
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
What class?

550
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
59800?

551
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Yes, my dear.

552
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Just scan the code here.

553
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
We will have a professional emotional counselor

554
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
to serve you one-on-one.

555
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
He's waiting for you in the VIP room.

556
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Okay.

557
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Let's go.

558
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Let's go.

559
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,480
60,000 yuan in the IQ tax is too expensive.

560
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
It's cheaper now.

561
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I used to date a man.

562
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
He lived here.

563
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
The rent is very expensive.

564
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
I thought only swindlers could rent it.

565
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
I didn't expect that there are swindlers

566
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
above swindlers.

567
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
But it's okay.

568
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
It's better than fortune telling.

569
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Just treat it as a price.

570
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I don't have to worry about spending his money on him.

571
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Besides,

572
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I don't spend his money on swindlers.

573
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
You're being ridiculous.

574
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Just call me Ms. Yang.

575
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,480
First, thank yourself.

576
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
You're sitting here now.

577
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Everything is going in the right direction.

578
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Thank yourself.

579
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Thank your courage, your dedication, your patience.

580
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
We've basically understood the situation.

581
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Do you two have a strong sense of resistance?

582
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
For example, he doesn't reply to your WeChat messages.

583
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
He blackmails you.

584
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Or he proposes a divorce or a separation.

585
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
No.

586
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
But we rarely reply to messages.

587
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
He's busy with work.

588
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
But as long as I mention the child,

589
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
he's still very sad.

590
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,480
You're quite optimistic.

591
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
You have a child.

592
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
It's a big family.

593
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
You must hold on to it.

594
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Your wish is for your husband to return to his family, right?

595
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
Ms. Yang, I have a few questions.

596
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
Please go ahead.

597
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Is this 100% replying?

598
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
How long has it been?

599
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
What if it doesn't work?

600
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
He's my friend.

601
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
Thank you.

602
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Of course.

603
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
This is 100% replying.

604
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
You can rest assured.

605
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
We have a series of services.

606
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,480
For example, we will help you change your personal image.

607
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:17,900
And WeChat

608
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Ms. Yang,

609
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,480
you mean you've been holding on to it and not replying?

610
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Can I understand that?

611
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
I'm just kidding.

612
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,480
It depends on how deep the gap is.

613
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
But in the end, it will be solved.

614
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
But if the gap is very deep

615
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,480
and the client is half-baked,

616
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
and he doesn't want to,

617
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
how much will he reply?

618
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Baby, why don't you go home first?

619
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,480
No, I'm so happy to talk to Ms. Yang.

620
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
I'll call you again.

621
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I'll go first, Ms. Yang.

622
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Sorry to bother you.

623
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Okay.

624
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Actually, I'm not that childish.

625
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
I just think that the last few classes

626
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,480
can solve the problem of my marriage.

627
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,480
I just can't help it.

628
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,480
I really want to talk to someone.

629
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
After all, some things

630
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,480
can't be said even with your best friend.

631
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
I'm sorry.

632
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
I didn't understand it before.

633
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Why so many people like to watch this kind of drama?

634
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
It's fake.

635
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Now I understand it a little.

636
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Maybe it's because life is too bitter.

637
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,480
So you have to eat a little sugar

638
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,480
to get into the bitterness of life.

639
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Well, I have nothing to say.

640
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
We've been married for ten years.

641
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,480
About two or three years ago,

642
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,480
we didn't talk much.

643
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
I asked him about the company.

644
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
He said, you don't understand,

645
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
I have to explain it to you.

646
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I talked to him about gossip.

647
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,480
He said, don't talk to me about

648
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
these things that are not the same.

649
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
I told him, Tiaotiao misses you.

650
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
He said, I know.

651
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,480
The child is your tool.

652
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,480
I don't know what to say to him.

653
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Last month, Tiaotiao had a fever.

654
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,480
He didn't answer my phone.

655
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,480
I finally found him through his assistant.

656
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I told him, no matter how late it is,

657
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
he should go home to sleep.

658
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,480
He told me where you were going on your business trip.

659
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,480
A family can go out and play sometimes.

660
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,480
What did he say?

661
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
He said,

662
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm like a family.

663
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm asking the boss for a favor.

664
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
I want to work.

665
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Do you know if he has

666
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,480
any other fixed sex partners?

667
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Fixed?

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
I don't think so.

669
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
It's...

670
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Can I give him a lock?

671
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Were you looking at your phone?

672
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,480
I passed by and saw you.

673
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Oh, yes.

674
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,480
I'm going to do a friend's emotional counseling.

675
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Is it for collecting material?

676
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,480
You can say that.

677
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,480
This store is very well-paid.

678
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,480
It means that women who are trapped in love are the most profitable.

679
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Think about it.

680
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,480
All skin care products, diet pills, emotional counseling,

681
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,480
are actually the feelings of anxiety.

682
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,480
You don't have this kind of anxiety, do you?

683
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,480
The sky is really a sky.

684
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Three words, two words.

685
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Accurate, in place.

686
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
You know how to talk.

687
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Who can be completely not anxious?

688
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I can do it too. I'm afraid I can't write the script.

689
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,480
After writing it, the crew will shoot it.

690
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
After shooting, I'm afraid that the final product will be bad.

691
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,480
I'm afraid that people will not like it.

692
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:55,320
It's a military

693
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
I don't know how good I am.

694
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,480
I think I'll think about it.

695
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Don't you?

696
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Look, typical human business.

697
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,480
The chase for the male god only costs 12,800.

698
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,480
But it costs 59,800 to return.

699
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,480
It means that people are not willing to pay a big price for something they don't get.

700
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,480
But they are afraid of losing and going forward.

701
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Right?

702
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,480
What kind of male god is worth 12,800?

703
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
It's very likely that someone has spent this money for you.

704
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
It's not just this number.

705
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I'm sorry.

706
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Luo Man, you are so interesting.

707
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Let's have a meal together.

708
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,480
No matter how much you talk, you are still controlling.

709
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,480
Maybe a little later. Sorry.

710
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,480
I'm writing a script. Tell me when you leave.

711
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Hello?

712
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
What are you doing now?

713
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,480
Writing a script. What else can I do? What about you?

714
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,480
The teacher suggested that I reduce the responsibility on my husband.

715
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Walk the warm-hearted path.

716
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,480
So I'm doing a shufu lei now.

717
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
I'll send it to your home later.

718
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,480
How do you know all the moves of the harem?

719
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,480
In the past, the concubines wanted to see the emperor, so they made some snacks and sent them over.

720
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Why don't you stop doing shufu lei?

721
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Making osmanthus cake is more direct.

722
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
You want to see the god?

723
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Now go to the hotel lobby.

724
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
I saw your Chen Mian.

725
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm going to the hotel lobby.

726
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I'll see you later.

727
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
I'll see you later.

728
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I'll see you later.

729
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
I'll see you later.

730
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
I'll see you later.

731
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
I'll see you later.

732
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
I'll see you later.

733
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
I'll see you later.

734
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
I'll see you later.

735
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
I'll see you later.

736
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I'll see you later.

737
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
I'll see you later.

738
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
I'll see you later.

739
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I'll see you later.

740
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
What is this?

741
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
What is this?

742
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
What is this?

743
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
What is this?

744
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
What is this?

745
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
What is this?

746
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
What is this?

747
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
What is this?

748
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
What is this?

749
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
What is this?

750
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
What is this?

751
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
What is this?

752
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
What is this?

753
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
What is this?

754
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
What is this?

755
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
This is my form.

756
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
This is right there.

757
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
It was written here.

758
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
It is a design foréd.

759
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I really do bring it here.

760
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Suddenly I get bored.

761
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Move aside!

762
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Move aside!

763
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Please move!

764
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Stop it right there.

765
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
So it is!

766
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
Say,

767
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
Tatoumon...?

768
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
Do you want me to do this?

769
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,480
But it's hard to tell

770
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
The most beautiful thing when you look back

771
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Is to face your own

772
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,480
Reborn or destroyed

773
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,480
I saw the moonlight in my life

774
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,480
The wind is cold at the entrance

775
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,480
In front of me is a big theater

776
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,480
The show is endless

777
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,480
I can learn a little from the two corners

778
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
It doesn't matter if you feel sad or sad

779
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Life will always come to an end

780
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Whether you are right or wrong

781
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,480
Thank you for doing everything

782
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Let yourself be proud of that

783
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,480
With life from the beginning to the end

784
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:42,480
How do you think it's not me

785
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,480
Thank you for watching
