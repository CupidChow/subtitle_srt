00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
Hmm

4
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Hmm

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ooh, Nia

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Nia

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hello, Xixi

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello, baby, are you out? We are almost there

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know you are not interested in this kind of blind date

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you are busy, we can meet next week

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Didn't we make an appointment at 7.30?

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Baby, you are wrong, it's 6.30, we have been waiting for you for half an hour

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Anyway, I will be there soon

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, you guys eat first, I will be there soon

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, then wait for you

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, bye bye

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Bye bye

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
About Zhang Ailing's love in Qingcheng

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Who can share your own opinion?

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Chen Kaixi

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Fan Liuyuan was a coward at first

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He didn't believe in true love

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He and Bai Liusu were in love in the end

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They got married

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It means love is hidden in everyone's heart

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You just need to wait for a chance

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Love will come out of the picture and grow into a big tree

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Luo Man, you say something

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think this story is not about love

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Or it has nothing to do with love

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's about dignity

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's already said in the novel

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If a woman can't get the love of a man, she can't get the respect of a woman

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bai Liusu caught Fan Liuyuan in the dating game

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He didn't want to love this man at all

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What he wanted was dignity

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He wanted to prove that he was worthy

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He deserves a better man

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He deserves to be looked at in another way

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He deserves everything

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So what he cares about is not a man at all

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But people who look down on him

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How long do we have?

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
About 45 minutes

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It must be 45 minutes

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The road is blocked

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The road is blocked

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The road is blocked

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have an appointment with Boss Zhou

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then it's seven thirty

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I will send you the location

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm leaving

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ok

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Chen Kaixi

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Today I, Bai Liusu, will be the one

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I have the most classes in this business school

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Sorry

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Baby, you finally come

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sorry

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You don't come

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We dare not to serve hot dishes

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let me introduce

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is Boss Zhou, Zhou Muxun

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is his club

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Their dishes are delicious

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is my best friend Luo Man

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Famous screenwriter

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Recently there is a TV drama called Tiger

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's written by him

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Ma Ziminggong

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Nice to meet you

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Nice to meet you

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you don't mind

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have to move my chopsticks first

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because I was too hungry after the script meeting

85
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I will have two bowls of rice first

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So Miss Zhong is from Jiangxi

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Jiangxi food is delicious

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Very spicy

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Just finished the script meeting

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The eyelashes are as high as the eyebrows

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Who believes it?

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The man believes it

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He put on a naked lipstick

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He thought it was a bare eye

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Smart

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He is not good at comparison

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He just goes on a professional path

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He is a little bit handsome

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He doesn't even want to eat by his face

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, Shao'e is here

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I will go to the bathroom

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Please give me a piece of fruit

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, Miss

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Miss Luo, you know how to eat

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Shao'e with fruit

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is the first Cantonese old man who knows how to eat

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I remember it seems that Mr. Cai said

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The fruit is with Shao'e juice

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's another level of taste

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Actually, I prefer to eat Cantonese food

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Pay attention to the ingredients and lightness

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Really?

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Cantonese food is my favorite

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Really?

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You ask Xixi

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I remember I went to Guangzhou last year

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I stayed in Baiping for three days

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I ate it one by one

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's really cool

124
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But I think the best Cantonese food is

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Shunde

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Shunde

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It has to be Shunde

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Shunde's fish

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And sannaji

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Green water with a fire

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You have to cook the ingredients in order

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The soup is unforgettable

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But it's a pity

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We don't have any delicious Cantonese food

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am so lazy

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't do anything but cook

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can only cook salty fish eggplant and crispy roast meat

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Of course I can't cook with a chef

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Crispy roast meat

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can even make a fire with a small sea urchin

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can beat me

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Since you know how to eat

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I hope you can eat well

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Of course

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You haven't started eating

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But I know

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

149
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know a man

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He is my husband's friend

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think he is the best

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He is the most suitable for you

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
38 years old

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He has been married but has no children

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am not sure what he does specifically

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because it seems that there are some places in every field

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There are houses everywhere

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Anyway, he must have been financially free early on

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The key is that he is well-educated

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He is well-educated and handsome

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wait a minute

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll show you my photo

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Look, isn't he handsome?

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He is handsome

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let me see how handsome he is

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hurry up

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He is handsome

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I know you may not want to be here

172
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But I think you can't get along with him

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can help you two to find a place to eat together

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have a plan

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Mr. Zhou has a private club

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He is very private

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He hides a lot of good wine

178
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And the food is delicious

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you think?

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are so thoughtful

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But...

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I haven't been to a private club

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Can you take me there?

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Ok

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Zhong...

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Zhong Qingcheng

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Zhong Qingcheng

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ok?

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Of course

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's seven thirty

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll send you the location

193
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Ok

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Bye

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ok, bye

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Bye

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Zhou Musun

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I am a partner of the Department of Architecture of Qingbei University

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can see the company under his name through the enterprise

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I can see the company under his name through the enterprise

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Normal

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am a rich man

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I am a rich man

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It doesn't matter

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I am not afraid of doing homework

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Come on

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I am a rich man

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am a rich man

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I told you it's not open to the outside

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Liar

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I am a rich man

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I am a rich man

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000

225
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000

227
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000

229
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I am a rich man

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I am a rich man

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I am a rich man

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I am a rich man

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I am a rich man

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I am a rich man

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000

I am a rich man

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I am a rich man

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I am a rich man

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000

I am a rich man

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You like Cernuda?

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I know he has not many followers

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I happen to see his translation

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
How to say it

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thanks for Internet and Stylist

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to tell the people who should grow up

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
thank you for the roses in this world.

254
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You're awesome, Ms. Luo.

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
To the poet.

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Come on. Let's toast to the poet.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Come on.

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's really rare.

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ms. Luo, can I call you Luo Man?

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Of course. You can call me whatever you want.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Boss Zhou, you must be busy dating a pretty girl.

262
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why are you so interested in my relationship?

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I met a girl a few days ago.

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She's very pretty and simple.

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I just want to introduce you to her.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What's wrong, Zhou?

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're leaving so soon?

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're not going to do it?

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I can't compete with others.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're so energetic and energetic.

272
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Women like to do this.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You don't think I'm too tired, do you?

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, right.

275
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
A few days ago, Chen Kai Qi asked me for your WeChat.

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I didn't cause you any trouble, did I?

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How could you?

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You have such a good taste.

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Girls who like you can't be wrong.

280
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm starting to get curious.

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What's the trouble with this?

282
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You just want to invite guests over to eat.

283
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
My wife, Chen Kai Qi, is always busy.

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But she's always busy with the food.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm telling you, it's good to be able to eat.

286
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Honestly, when did you ask Mr. Fan to come over to my place?

287
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I just got a batch of quality, single vineyards.

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not going to make a fool of you.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm telling you, if you're going to make an IPO,

290
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you better keep some dignity for me.

291
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sisters' gathering.

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Happy matching.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The meeting between the team and the cowboys

294
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
will bring a new style to the new Chinese city.

295
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Put on the gentle fans.

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Dive into the flower garden.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
They are all good brands.

298
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
For you who love each other.

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Go to WeChat and search for your favorite brand.

300
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Buy it with a big brand.

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The chance of getting a good deal is quite high.

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm because there are more seafood today.

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So I arranged white grapes for everyone.

304
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It just so happens that I just got a batch of quality, single vineyards.

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Another day.

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll invite you to taste it for me another day.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay.

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
By the way, Xing Chen.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The music you recommended to me to practice dancing before.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It seems to be jazz.

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Can you push me again?

312
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't find it.

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No problem.

314
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Xing Chen, I'm going to go.

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I have a question.

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Xing Chen used to practice dancing.

317
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
His body is very soft.

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's okay.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I was just scared when I was in school.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Then the professional training must be different.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Then you guys eat first.

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay.

324
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
An outsider.

325
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why are you so sad?

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Happy.

327
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're dressed so youthfully.

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Gift.

329
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What gift do you bring?

330
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Come on.

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Sit down.

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let me introduce.

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is my best friend, Mo Man.

334
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A big screenwriter.

335
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
She has a woman who is good at WeChat.

336
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is Zhong Xing Chen.

337
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
She is a very potential actor.

338
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We met in a dance class.

339
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
She is so beautiful.

340
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I can't stand to see her all the time.

341
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So I even flashed her.

342
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Luo Man.

343
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Can I add your WeChat?

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Come on.

345
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay.

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Do you want some fruit or dessert?

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay.

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Let me help you.

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Thank you, Kai Qi.

350
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This strawberry is delicious.

351
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Xing Chen.

352
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Why is your skin so good?

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You are filming and live broadcasting.

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Your skin is so soft.

355
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How can I say that your skin is good?

356
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I have to compete with you.

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So you are a drama student?

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Xing Chen graduated from drama school.

360
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I am not.

361
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Xixi and I are college classmates.

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We are also roommates.

363
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We are best friends.

364
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We graduated from Chinese school.

365
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Chinese school?

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I didn't know that.

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Chinese school?

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't think they teach you how to write a script.

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How can I say that?

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
As long as you know the basic structure of a script,

371
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you can write it.

372
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why do you ask so much?

373
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you interested?

374
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I am a little interested.

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I just don't know if you are willing to teach me.

376
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Of course I am not.

377
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Have you ever heard of a saying?

378
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's called

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
teaching your students to starve to death.

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You are so smart.

381
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Which teacher dares to teach you?

382
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This teacher has a sense of temptation.

383
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I understand.

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So how did you start working?

385
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Xixi knows it best.

386
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I just graduated from college at that time.

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I just want to find an interesting and free job.

388
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I will work in this industry.

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I will start a business.

390
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You are so brave.

391
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Did anyone teach you?

392
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Of course not.

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I didn't know anyone when I first entered the industry.

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
At first, I wrote on the Internet

395
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the public number and the screen.

396
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Sometimes I wrote the script for advertisements.

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Then I started to organize planning meetings

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and write stories.

399
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I am a screenwriter.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I can't write a sentence.

401
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can write whatever I want.

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But screenwriters don't go out much.

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They don't spend much money.

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You are so good.

405
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You are so good at selling your products.

406
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
By the way, Kexi.

407
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I saw your WeChat Moments yesterday.

408
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You are posting about your own skills.

409
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I was thinking that

410
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you are very well-read.

411
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You are from the Chinese department.

412
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's not surprising.

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Actually, I like it.

414
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I look good in the sun.

415
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We are all waiting for a point

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
when we are in this situation.

417
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Thank you.

418
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you.

419
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Thank you.

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I just poured it for him.

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't take him as an outsider.

422
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Here.

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you.

424
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's a cabbage.

425
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's hot.

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But I can't help it.

427
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I just like it.

428
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
By the way,

429
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
do you want to control the heat in the morning?

430
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's okay.

431
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
In the morning,

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
we don't go to the gym to keep our body shape.

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We are not girls who are not good at dancing.

434
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We know each other in the dance class.

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Our teacher often uses her videos to stimulate me.

436
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Let me show you.

437
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay.

438
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
A woman with talent and hard work.

439
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This is the perfect heat

440
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
that I've been waiting for the whole night.

441
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Look.

442
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Is it a pear?

443
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's really good.

444
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm still working hard because I'm talented.

445
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's really good.

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's really good.

447
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Jiao Jun.

448
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Full marks.

449
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

450
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
With this fried pork with milk,

451
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
we can end this perfect dinner.

452
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

453
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Liking is the most important thing.

455
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Here.

456
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's a big deal.

457
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
How do you go to Kaixi?

458
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Do you want me to send you off?

459
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No, thanks.

460
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The car will be here in a minute.

461
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Then...

462
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You two...

463
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll take Kaixi's car.

464
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Thank you.

465
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You can call me whatever you want.

466
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Thank you.

467
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Bye.

468
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Bye-bye.

469
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Take care.

470
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Thank you.

471
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's okay.

472
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm here.

473
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you, Kaixi.

474
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll get going.

475
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay.

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Bye-bye.

477
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Let's meet again.

478
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay, I'm leaving.

479
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Bye.

480
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Are you sure?

509
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Are you sure you want to delete me?

510
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Don't be so rude.

511
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We can talk things out.

512
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know Zhou Muxun now, right?

513
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Do you think I'm just

514
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
a peacock who's here to eat?

515
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Right?

516
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm here for Zhou Muxun.

517
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So you think

518
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm not good enough

519
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
for a guy who looks like him, right?

520
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I used to be like this,

521
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
but I'm still like this.

522
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Baby, I'm so happy

523
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that you got the bouquet.

524
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I want to be your baby.

525
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't worry.

526
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'll be the next one

527
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
who finds the real baby.

528
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Zhang Fan, let me introduce you.

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Come on.

530
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
My partner, Zhang Fan.

531
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This is Kai Qi's best friend.

532
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Boss.

533
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Let me introduce you.

534
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This is Chen Mian's partner, Zhang Fan.

535
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
This is my classmate, Liu Qianqian.

536
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Qianqian is excellent.

537
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
She doesn't have a boyfriend yet.

538
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Boss, you have to be more positive.

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Qianqian, you two.

540
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let's talk alone.

541
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's talk for a while.

542
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Come on, Qianqian.

543
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Come on.

544
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Baby, are you leaving tonight?

545
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I miss you.

546
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Call me when you arrive.

547
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Sure.

548
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You wanted to fight for your life.

549
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But you were not here.

550
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Even if I introduce Zhang Fan to you,

551
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
can you stay in the same house

552
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
with your husband?

553
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Luo Man,

554
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
do you think the whole world

555
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
has let you down?

556
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I don't care if people in this world

557
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
let me down or not.

558
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't care.

559
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I just care what you think of me,

560
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
what you think of me.

561
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't you want me to be happy?

562
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You like to speculate about others.

563
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We have been friends for so many years.

564
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's be frank today.

565
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I speculate about others.

566
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Or is the fact that it is like this?

567
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Let's go back to that woman.

568
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's right.

569
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That's right.

570
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
From what you know about me,

571
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
how can you not see

572
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
how much I have been there?

573
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You are also looking at me

574
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and finding a sense of superiority.

575
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
If I were as sensitive as you,

576
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
our friendship would have been broken long ago.

577
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You posted on Weibo every night

578
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
that women should be brave enough

579
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
to realize their own values.

580
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The whole world has given up

581
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the right to choose at the beginning.

582
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No work, no dignity.

583
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
When you posted those things,

584
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
why didn't you worry about me?

585
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I didn't post these things

586
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
to show you.

587
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You are so sensitive.

588
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I can't see you well.

589
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Do you think a man like Zhou Muxun

590
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
needs me to introduce his girlfriend to him?

591
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Do you think it's possible?

592
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You...

593
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You have done a lot of homework.

594
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Baidu must have been tired.

595
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But Baidu will not tell you

596
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
that Zhou Muxun

597
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
finally got divorced.

598
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
He will not get married again.

599
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This kind of man

600
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
will not give his girlfriend

601
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
any practical benefits.

602
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What he wants is to rely on his own charm

603
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to conquer the sense of accomplishment of women.

604
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He will not give money,

605
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
will not be responsible,

606
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
will not get married.

607
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He is a swindler.

608
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Can you still get it?

609
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Then why did you introduce him

610
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
to Zhong Qingcheng?

611
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Because Chen Minggou hit him.

612
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He was rewarded 40,000 yuan

613
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
for live broadcasting for a month.

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So...

615
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So you want to get close to your rival.

616
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
No, Xixi, why didn't you say it earlier?

617
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You want to get close to your rival.

618
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Why?

619
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Why do you want to pull me?

620
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm nervous.

621
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I feel better

622
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
when you are here.

623
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
After all,

624
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
you are my best friend.

625
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm not.

626
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You said Luo Man will come back tonight.

627
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's hard to say.

628
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Someone saw him eating in the back room

629
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
that night.

630
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The male screenwriter...

631
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
What did Luo Man do to you?

632
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I think

633
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Luo Man is not that bad.

634
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What a great opportunity!

635
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He said he wanted to be a screenwriter.

636
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
He is a master.

637
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
When this relationship is confirmed,

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
he can go to his master's house twice a week.

639
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
He will have a bright future.

640
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I think

641
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Luo Man and that teacher are quite normal.

642
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
He is just too interested in screenwriting.

643
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What's the problem?

644
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't be so mean.

645
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No, Chen Kaixi.

646
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You really think Luo Man

647
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
treats you as a good friend?

648
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
His eyes are almost on top of his head.

649
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Who does he think he is?

650
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's okay.

651
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
He is just a little bit too aggressive.

652
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
In fact, he is actually very good.

653
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Is it too unfair

654
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
for you to talk like this?

655
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
No, how can I tell you that?

656
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You don't understand the test.

657
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You can't write the thesis clearly.

658
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You are good at talking about others' mistakes.

659
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I will pretend I didn't hear it today.

660
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
If there is another time,

661
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
don't blame me for being rude.

662
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Let's go.

663
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
This room is too dirty.

664
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I will take you with me.

665
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Chen Kaixi,

666
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I thought you were like them

667
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and didn't like me.

668
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Luo Man,

669
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
a bird that can't fly.

670
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We are all birds.

671
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Only you are the red one.

672
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But I don't remember you.

673
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I envy you.

674
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You are so beautiful.

675
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You look beautiful.

676
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I am so jealous.

677
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I will not let you suffer any grievances.

678
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I will not let you suffer any grievances.

679
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Even if it's just a breeze

680
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Life is just like a guest

681
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The beauty of the world

682
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The most beautiful when you look back

683
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Dare to face yourself

684
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Reborn or destroyed

685
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I saw the moonlight

686
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The wind that blows in the back

687
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Can become this big theater

688
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The show is endless

689
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Finally one day I can learn

690
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
No need to be sad, it doesn't matter

691
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Life will always come to an end

692
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Whether you will be back

693
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Thank you for being there every day

694
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let yourself be proud of that

695
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Follow your life from the end to the end

696
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
How did you think it wasn't me?

697
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Thank you for watching!
