Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

12
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,640
A man won't give his girlfriend any practical benefits.

13
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,640
What he wants is to rely on his own charm to capture a woman's sense of accomplishment.

14
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Not giving money, not being responsible, not getting married. He's a swindler.

15
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Sadness and unhappiness are all going to pass

16
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,640
The time of regret has come

17
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Go away, don't be shy

18
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
He's been scolding me.

19
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Since I was little, my father never scolded me.

20
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,640
He never said a word.

21
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Why would he scold me?

22
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Let me tell you, you still have your father.

23
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Do you know what my father said?

24
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I told him that there's a black screen in the game.

25
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
What did he say?

26
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,640
He said, as long as you're good enough,

27
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,640
you can't get rid of any kind of black screen.

28
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Who said that?

29
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't force yourself

30
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,640
You're already very, very, very good.

31
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,640
We love each other

32
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Thank goodness, thank goodness I have you.

33
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Thank goodness you have me.

34
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Don't be afraid

35
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,640
We're going to be together forever.

36
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Forever

37
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Forever

38
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
What's wrong?

39
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Luo Man Xing, he broke out.

40
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Was he the best in your class?

41
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,640
We're going to be together forever

42
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,640
We're going to be together forever

43
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Now, we can only swallow the real bad.

44
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,640
And the time to digest is only one night.

45
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Bye bye, mommy.

46
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Bye bye.

47
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
I love you.

48
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I love you.

49
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
I love you.

50
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Hello, baby.

51
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I went to bed early yesterday and didn't see you.

52
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,640
What's wrong?

53
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Yesterday?

54
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Yesterday was pretty good.

55
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,640
We had dinner together.

56
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,640
And we had a little drink and walked around.

57
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,640
He wanted me to go to his house to watch a movie.

58
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
And then I thought, don't go.

59
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
You have to take some.

60
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,640
You said you were going to the furniture store on the weekend.

61
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I'll go with you.

62
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Okay.

63
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,640
How was it yesterday?

64
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Was the set I gave you okay?

65
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Did you make President Chen confused?

66
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
A magic attack.

67
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Chen Mian, he's not that bad.

68
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm not that bad.

69
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm not that bad.

70
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Chen Mian, he's not that bad.

71
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Next time, buy me a better one.

72
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Okay, okay.

73
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
If it's too slow, it'll be out of sync.

74
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Xixi, I have a work WeChat.

75
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Okay, you can go ahead.

76
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Bye bye.

77
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Bye bye.

78
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Chen Mian said the sofa at home is too hard.

79
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I just ordered a new one.

80
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I'll move this to your house.

81
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
You just sit there for a while.

82
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Okay, thank you.

83
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,640
What kind of operation is that?

85
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,640
How dare you contact me?

86
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Zong, let's go.

87
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's go.

88
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Jheng.

89
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
President Chen is here.

90
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
President Chen.

91
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
You look really chill.

92
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
You had a good sleep last night, right?

93
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Of course. I had a good rest.

94
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I slept 10 hours last night.

95
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
You do not deserve to give me that.

96
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
I have a secret weapon.

97
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Fang Chi, this my cousin.

98
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
He is a doctor from Yanyi.

99
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
This young man is so generous.

100
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
You're so popular.

101
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Wow!

102
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Nice!

103
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Nice!

104
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Nice!

105
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
What are they called?

106
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
The Eight Tiger Brothers.

107
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
What's going on, young man?

108
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Didn't we agree to let it go?

109
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
You're so aggressive.

110
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Come on, Zhou.

111
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
You won the game.

112
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
You're like a cow's skin candy.

113
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
You're so aggressive that you killed me.

114
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I have a good understanding of the cow's skin candy.

115
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm the one who cooperates with Mr. Zhou.

116
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Okay, let's not talk nonsense.

117
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Let's get down to business.

118
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Can we get the pre-IPO you talked about last time?

119
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Zhou, didn't I push the CFO to you?

120
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
He's in charge of this.

121
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm just a product manager.

122
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
You asked me to add Daniel.

123
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I did.

124
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,640
But he seems to be quite busy.

125
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I think we should communicate directly and efficiently.

126
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Right?

127
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
You should tell me the truth.

128
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Where is this thing stuck?

129
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Zhou, you said we were brothers.

130
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
I'll tell you the truth.

131
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
We're not friends.

132
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Your company is so good.

133
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
What's the problem?

134
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,640
The problem is that there is no Qingzhou in the angel's wheel.

135
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
They've all spoken.

136
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Any company's head, they have no problem.

137
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Only you can't do it.

138
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Then you teach me what I should do.

139
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
What can I do?

140
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Yes, Qingzhou is the same as our Zhenfeng Xiang team.

141
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
But I think

142
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,640
we don't have any room to go back to the city.

143
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Right?

144
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Are you worried?

145
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
I'm going back.

146
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
You're in such a hurry?

147
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
I have something to do in the yard.

148
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I have to go now.

149
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Okay.

150
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
I'll call the driver to send you.

151
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
By the way,

152
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
you should be careful about the second uncle's visit.

153
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Okay.

154
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Welcome to the first day of the college entrance exam.

155
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Please take your seat.

156
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
I'm a student.

157
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Hello, Mr. Lu.

158
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Hello.

159
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Hello, Mr. Lu.

160
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Hello, Miss.

161
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Miss.

162
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Miss.

163
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Hello, Miss.

164
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Hello.

165
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Miss.

166
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Hello.

167
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Miss.

168
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Miss.

169
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Hello.

170
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Hello, Miss.

171
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Can you read on the road?

172
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
It's too crowded.

173
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
It's okay.

174
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
It's okay.

175
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
It just started.

176
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Let me answer the phone.

177
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Let's stand in the middle.

178
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,840
He got married after graduation.

179
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,360
He learned to paint in Europe for two years.

180
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
He's bored after giving birth.

181
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
He's a curator.

182
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,440
That's impressive.

183
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Look at him.

184
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
You can be one of them.

185
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,600
You don't have to work for him.

186
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,640
You don't have to be a servant.

187
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,040
You just need to take a nice picture

188
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,240
and show your face in the open-air.

189
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,080
I think I'm really nice to him.

190
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,360
I think he's still doing it even though he's losing his age.

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
Why don't you support him?

192
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,160
With this money,

193
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,960
he won't have to do anything else.

194
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,480
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,600
Kai Qi.

196
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,400
Luna, congratulations.

197
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,000
Kai Qi.

198
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,640
Let's go.

199
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
Let's go over there.

200
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,720
Your umbrella is so big.

201
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,720
Your makeup is so pretty.

202
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,880
It's so pretty.

203
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,520
I feel like I'm in a movie.

204
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,800
It's been a while.

205
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,120
It's been a while.

206
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
You're getting prettier.

207
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,640
I'm a good girl.

208
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,880
I'm a good girl.

209
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Thank you.

210
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,800
See you.

211
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,520
Go to work.

212
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Okay.

213
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,600
It's been a while.

214
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
Yeah, it's been a while.

215
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,640
Let's go eat.

216
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
Let's go next time.

217
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay.

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,640
See you next time.

219
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,400
Okay.

220
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,560
Bye.

221
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,560
Kai Qi.

222
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,760
You're pretty again.

223
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,040
I'm going to the internet cafe.

224
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,400
Okay.

225
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,160
Go to work.

226
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
Bye.

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
Kai Qi, you've lost weight.

228
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
You've lost weight, too.

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,920
No, I haven't.

230
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,080
Isn't that Zhong Qing Cheng?

231
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,840
I saw him at your house last time.

232
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,560
Yeah.

233
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,320
I haven't seen the painting I drew.

234
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm going to take a look.

235
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,280
Okay.

236
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

237
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,720
Kai Qi.

238
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry, Kai Qi.

239
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,240
Why are you sorry?

240
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,800
I should have known.

241
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,160
Chen Min was married.

242
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,520
But I was too vain

243
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,320
to ignore the fact

244
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,640
and get close to him.

245
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,000
It's my fault.

246
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,720
Because of his status,

247
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,480
his knowledge,

248
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,080
and of course, his ability,

249
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,880
for a girl like me,

250
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm too attractive.

251
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,640
Don't say that to me.

252
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,480
I know

253
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,400
it's hard to forgive you.

254
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,960
But I didn't expect

255
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
you to forgive me right away.

256
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,640
I just hope

257
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,320
I can talk to you in a positive way.

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,080
After all, I've been in this city for so long.

259
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,760
You're the first person

260
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,240
who's been so nice to me.

261
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,840
Why do you know

262
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,280
how nice I am to you?

263
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,360
I understand.

264
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,600
I just realized that

265
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,280
what you told me

266
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,800
and what you taught me

267
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
are not fake.

268
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,480
Kai Qi.

269
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,720
I've never told you

270
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,440
about myself.

271
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
Because I'm embarrassed.

272
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,480
My parents

273
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
divorced when I was very young.

274
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,160
My mom

275
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,880
raised me up.

276
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,600
So,

277
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,360
I tried very hard.

278
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,640
I couldn't

279
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,880
eat too much.

280
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,680
My mom

281
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,080
is still in her hometown

282
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,800
running a small restaurant.

283
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,840
Sometimes, she's very busy.

284
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
She's still counting the bills at 1 or 2 o'clock.

285
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,320
She can't sleep for long.

286
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,760
She has to get up and go shopping.

287
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,800
Sometimes, she'll

288
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,160
work for the customers

289
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,960
for a long time.

290
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,200
So, I'm not thinking

291
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,680
about much.

292
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,640
I just want to do my best in acting.

293
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,040
I want to make more money

294
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,880
so that my mom won't have to work so hard.

295
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
I just want to live a good life.

296
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,320
Kai Qi.

297
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,560
I know you might not believe me

298
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,200
when I say this.

299
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
But I've never thought

300
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
of hurting you.

301
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,480
And I really want to be your friend.

302
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
I know you're not.

303
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,680
But I still want to thank you

304
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,000
for giving me this opportunity

305
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to say all these.

306
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Let's go.

307
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,760
Feng Dao is here.

308
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,960
Let's go.

309
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,400
Let's go.

310
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,720
Rooming together.

311
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,660
Having hangouts with girls

312
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,680
gives the Chinese feel a fresh feel.

313
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,720
Wearing decent clothes

314
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,800
and entering the fleece garden.

315
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:46,900
Oh

316
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,680
Hey

317
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,600
to get a chance.

318
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,800
Of course, I have to maintain

319
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
my relationship with Chen Kaixi.

320
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,240
Guifu is like a palace.

321
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,600
There are many gates.

322
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,120
Every door that is opened

323
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,120
can hold a chance.

324
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,760
Please come in.

325
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,280
Okay.

326
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,920
Thank you.

327
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,120
Here you are.

328
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,520
Welcome.

329
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
A scriptwriter who has a promotion period.

330
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,480
Luo Man is a door that God opened for me.

331
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
I can't miss it.

332
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,840
What?

333
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,240
You still want to be Chen Kaixi's good friend?

334
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,200
Xiao Zhong, I think you're not stupid.

335
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,360
You and a full-time housewife

336
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,040
stand in the absolute opposite.

337
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,360
And you want to be with this full-time housewife

338
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
and continue to be a good friend?

339
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,480
Yes.

340
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,920
What are you thinking?

341
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
I don't want to be Chen Mian's friend.

342
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
I don't care if you believe it or not.

343
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,320
Anyway, what I hate the most

344
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,000
is to be entangled with a man.

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,520
I don't want to be Chen Mian's mistress.

346
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,680
I just want to be Chen Kaixi's good friend.

347
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,000
I might need a cup of coffee.

348
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
I'll have a look.

349
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,360
Okay.

350
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,160
Do you want some?

351
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
Okay, thank you.

352
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,000
Here.

353
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,800
Thank you.

354
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,280
I think it tastes better than the coffee outside.

355
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,600
I just want to make it cheaper.

356
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,440
This is a few dollars a cup.

357
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,040
I have to drink five cups a day.

358
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
If I buy it outside,

359
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,360
I really can't afford it.

360
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,240
You have to drink five cups a day?

361
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,880
Is it bad for your heart?

362
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Of course.

363
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
But I have no choice.

364
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,240
Miss Luo Man,

365
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,760
I have a question.

366
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,240
Do you write every day?

367
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,320
Yes.

368
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
How many words do you write?

369
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,920
It depends.

370
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,120
If it's an emergency,

371
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,040
I write about 10,000 words a day.

372
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,720
If I write my own script,

373
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,640
I write about 2,000 to 3,000 words a day.

374
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,440
You have to write like this for seven or eight years.

375
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,560
You don't have any holidays or double holidays?

376
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
Actually, there is one thing that I care about.

377
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
I don't want to let myself rest.

378
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,320
Because people are all grumpy.

379
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,880
I want to rest for one day,

380
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,520
and I want to rest for the next day.

381
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,880
Then I just rest.

382
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,800
Miss Luo Man,

383
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,720
I think you are the kind of woman I admire the most.

384
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,800
Really.

385
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,680
I think you don't depend on men,

386
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,360
but on yourself.

387
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,320
You depend on your talent and ability to live.

388
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm really envious.

389
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,520
Actually, I think Xixi is right.

390
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,600
You are so beautiful.

391
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
You married a good man.

392
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Then you have a good life.

393
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,880
Why do you have to suffer this?

394
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,800
I don't want to get married.

395
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,040
I just want to work and shoot a good show.

396
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
Luo Man,

397
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,160
I've always wanted to be your good friend

398
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,520
since I first met you.

399
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,160
Because I think you are the best scriptwriter

400
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,680
in this industry.

401
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,320
Maybe one day,

402
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,640
you can recommend me to some director.

403
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,560
Of course, I'm afraid that I'm too ambitious.

404
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,120
So I thought,

405
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,280
okay,

406
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,320
let's just have fun together.

407
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll slowly get to know you.

408
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,040
I just didn't expect this to happen.

409
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,920
I want to be your good friend.

410
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,760
And I've never thought about hurting Kaixi.

411
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
Of course, I know that

412
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,640
if I don't break up with Kaixi,

413
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,040
you won't be able to keep in touch with me.

414
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,200
To be honest,

415
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,720
I admire you for being so straightforward

416
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,680
and so honest

417
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,040
and letting me see your desires

418
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
on the table.

419
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,760
Thank you for your sincerity.

420
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,520
How about this?

421
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,680
You go to the art exhibition tomorrow.

422
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,760
You'll apologize to her sincerely if you get a chance.

423
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,160
Tomorrow?

424
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,960
What else?

425
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,360
Do you think you can still open

426
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,640
Kaixi's door?

427
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,480
What should I say?

428
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,120
How should I apologize?

429
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,560
That's important.

430
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,720
For example,

431
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,400
let's not talk about how Chen Min seduced you.

432
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Just talk about yourself.

433
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,480
Just put yourself down.

434
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,880
Just say,

435
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,120
I'm too vain.

436
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
I can ignore this fact

437
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,160
and get too close to her.

438
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
Remember,

439
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,920
it's getting close.

440
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Not dating.

441
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Be precise.

442
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,320
Then,

443
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,000
the accident happens.

444
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,840
Don't be a coward.

445
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,800
And add some

446
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
miserable background.

447
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,240
Just like the show.

448
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,920
For example,

449
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,760
a family who's hoping you'll succeed.

450
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,840
Or a parent.

451
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,600
A father.

452
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
A father is more suitable.

453
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
I'd rather talk about my mom.

454
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,160
My mom is very optimistic.

455
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,880
Like you said,

456
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,560
in this kind of situation,

457
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,720
you should talk about some things that are sincere.

458
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,240
It can move people.

459
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,280
I said you're smart.

460
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,360
The 벤야

461
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
celebrity

462
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
You asked me to buy something big?

463
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
I just Adjodmo's shoes.

464
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Is this okay?

465
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,760
So great.

466
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,880
How much do you want?

467
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,000
How much?

468
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,040
Can't you say those words?

469
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,000
Besides,

470
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
feel more comfortable at home?

471
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
I'll get you something to eat.

472
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Hey.

473
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Yeah?

474
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Actually, I want to ask you something.

475
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Go ahead.

476
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
That dinner...

477
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Didn't Xixi introduce you to Zhou Muzun?

478
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Why didn't you...

479
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Why didn't you...

480
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
You said I'm not a fool.

481
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
I didn't realize that.

482
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
He looked at you so clearly.

483
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
He looks at you, okay?

484
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Which step have you made?

485
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Now?

486
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Hmm.

487
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Actually...

488
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
How should I put it?

489
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
It's normal.

490
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
We go on dates, eat,

491
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
chat, watch movies.

492
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,400
We chat until 2 or 3.

493
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
To be honest,

494
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
I'm not feeling well.

495
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm free to do whatever I want.

496
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm not free to do anything.

497
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm not free to do anything.

498
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I can't do anything.

499
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
The next day, I have to get up and type more than 4000 words.

500
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I feel like...

501
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
How should I put it?

502
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
It's not suitable.

503
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
It's not suitable.

504
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Time flies.

505
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Work is definitely more reliable than men.

506
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
You're still young.

507
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
You're still young.

508
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
If you were like me,

509
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,400
you would be more sober than me.

510
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Really?

511
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,400
My ex-boyfriend is a weirdo.

512
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Really?

513
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Come on.

514
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
We have wine and food.

515
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Let's chat.

516
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Give me two or three cups.

517
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Come on.

518
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Brother.

519
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
You have wine and food.

520
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Really?

521
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Sister Man, I'm just trying to survive.

522
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
I can't drink anymore.

523
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
I can't drink anymore.

524
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
I have to type 4000 words tomorrow.

525
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
I'll just do it for a while.

526
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Go to sleep.

527
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Sleep for a while.

528
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
I feel like I have to sleep.

529
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I have to sleep.

530
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I'll just do it for a while.

531
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Baby, eat some fruit.

532
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Teacher, eat some fruit.

533
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
I'll go home.

534
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
You're so good at drawing.

535
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Why do you have an official seal in this little chicken?

536
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
The crown seal.

537
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,600
It was you when I teased estan.

538
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,100
Was it about the Paintball?

539
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,100
No, that actually sounds from Mr bro's POU team.

540
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
After she stopped teasing you,

541
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
He came to me. Is it you?

542
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
I know.

543
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
I know.

544
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Yes, Mr. Ning.

545
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
We made adjustments

546
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
according to your previous requirements.

547
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
The main adjustment is...

548
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
The main adjustment is

549
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
the relationship between the male and female lead.

550
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
But in this case,

551
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
the side effects of the latter

552
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
may be shortened.

553
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
I think

554
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
the male lead

555
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
is the one who is the most important.

556
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
It's impossible to shorten it.

557
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Do you think it's okay?

558
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
Excuse me, I have to answer a call.

559
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Hello?

560
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
What?

561
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Wait for the boss to call me.

562
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I'm going to work.

563
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Hello, Xixi.

564
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
I'm having a script meeting.

565
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
What's wrong with the sofa?

566
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
It's blocked the corridor of my house.

567
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
You said it was a good thing

568
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
that I gave you last time.

569
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
And my sofa

570
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
is not that big.

571
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
It's too big.

572
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
It's just right to put your big house here.

573
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
The rental house

574
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
is not good enough for a big house.

575
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
What do you mean?

576
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Can you stop being so weird?

577
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
How am I weird?

578
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
What's wrong with you?

579
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Before you sent it,

580
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
you should have said hello to me.

581
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
You're still so shy to say that?

582
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
You haven't asked me about many things.

583
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
You and his little mind,

584
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
do you think I can't see it?

585
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I just think

586
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
it might be useful to keep it.

587
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Don't think you're the only one.

588
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Everyone thinks you wrote the script.

589
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
You can make up your own script.

590
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Boss, why is it so late?

591
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I have something to do.

592
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm going to work.

593
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
I'm going to work.

594
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
I have something to do.

595
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Send it back.

596
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
What about the transportation?

597
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I'll pay.

598
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Okay, boss.

599
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Mr. Lu,

600
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
our IP

601
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
won the first prize

602
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
in the long-distance rally.

603
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
Really?

604
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
It's all about women.

605
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
There's business and there's love.

606
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
The law is the gateway.

607
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
It tells the difficulties

608
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
of several female lawyers.

609
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
For example,

610
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
job harassment.

611
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Thirty women

612
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
are in a difficult situation

613
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,500
in the marriage market.

614
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I believe

615
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
the problem is that

616
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
the women who are in the market

617
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,500
will be

618
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
discussed in the society.

619
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
So I look forward to Mr. Lu's participation.

620
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Are you kidding me?

621
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
You're writing a script.

622
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Do you know how to write a script?

623
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Do you think you're a fool?

624
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
But everyone has a light.

625
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
The audience

626
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
will easily be confused.

627
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Everyone's character

628
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
is very full.

629
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
No matter the number of people,

630
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
or the number of the bill,

631
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
the audience

632
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
will find their own way.

633
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Take away the money.

634
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
The audience

635
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
will be very excited.

636
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
This is what

637
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
every audience

638
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
is looking for.

639
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Yes.

640
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
The sense of involvement is strong.

641
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Yes.

642
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
The audience will be happy to see it.

643
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Yes.

644
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
It must be very beautiful.

645
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I want to see it

646
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
as you said.

647
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Mr. Lu,

648
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
it's okay.

649
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
I'll see you later.

650
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Okay.

651
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Okay.

652
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Take care.

653
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Okay.

654
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Thank you.

655
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Okay.

656
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Bye.

657
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Look forward to the cooperation.

658
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
Luo Man?

659
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
It's really you.

660
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
I almost didn't recognize you.

661
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
You're so beautiful.

662
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
You haven't changed.

663
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
I haven't changed?

664
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
I have Yu Weiwen.

665
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Congratulations.

666
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Your play.

667
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Everyone around me is watching it.

668
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
You've successfully

669
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
achieved your dream.

670
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
You watched it?

671
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Of course.

672
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
You're a great screenwriter now.

673
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
No.

674
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm a great writer.

675
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
You're modest.

676
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
To be honest,

677
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
you...

678
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
You still...

679
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
still do the job?

680
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I can't do anything else.

681
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
But now,

682
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
how should I put it?

683
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
You're really a return-to-the-start.

684
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
In the past,

685
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
no matter what,

686
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
you always wore three sets of suits.

687
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm asking you,

688
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
are you tired?

689
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
This is your industry's...

690
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
attitude.

691
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
You don't have an attitude anymore.

692
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
I can't move.

693
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Look.

694
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
I'm thinking about

695
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
my youth.

696
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I like to pretend.

697
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
No.

698
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
You're exquisite.

699
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
But I'm different now.

700
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
I'm natural and comfortable.

701
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
That's why I'm suitable.

702
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
That's good.

703
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
I'll add you on WeChat.

704
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Okay.

705
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I'll scan you.

706
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Okay.

707
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I've searched his WeChat Moments.

708
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
He doesn't post any news about his industry

709
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
or any new projects.

710
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
He's basically

711
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
a time-honored person.

712
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Once a man starts to post

713
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
a time-honored person,

714
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
basically,

715
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
his career is over.

716
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Did he invite you to dinner?

717
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I said,

718
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
I can't go on Saturday.

719
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I have to attend

720
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
the new video conference in Jiangya.

721
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Guess what he said.

722
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
He said it in a funny way.

723
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
He said,

724
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500
you're a top-notch person now.

725
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Is it convenient to

726
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,500
take me to see you?

727
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Why did you two split up?

728
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
He was very vulgar.

729
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
He was a jerk.

730
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
He was a man of his word.

731
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I was a man of my word.

732
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
But he was a total jerk.

733
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Basically,

734
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
he was just a man

735
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
who didn't like me.

736
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Have some water.

737
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
It's good.

738
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
Honey,

739
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
have you ever thought about

740
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
going to the civil service office

741
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
or finding a public official

742
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
in college?

743
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Don't think too much.

744
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I trust your

745
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
scriptwriting skills.

746
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
I just heard that

747
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
art comes from life,

748
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
right?

749
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Do you want to

750
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
find a job

751
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
and experience

752
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
other people's lives?

753
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
You want to accumulate

754
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
some material for yourself, right?

755
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
No.

756
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
I think my script

757
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
is quite dramatic.

758
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I want to finish this.

759
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Okay.

760
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Keep writing.

761
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Honey,

762
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
you're always

763
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
your top fan.

764
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Then I realized

765
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
that he asked me

766
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
to find a job

767
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
in a normal job.

768
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
It wasn't a suggestion.

769
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
It was a final pass.

770
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Two months later,

771
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
he broke up with me.

772
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I've forgotten

773
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
what he was looking for.

774
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
But we both know it.

775
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
He was a top star

776
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
and he was young and promising.

777
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
I was a young man

778
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
and I was a man of my word.

779
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I didn't have a family

780
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
or a decent job.

781
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
To put it bluntly,

782
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
he thought

783
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
I couldn't take it out

784
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
and I couldn't take my hands off it.

785
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
After this big breakup,

786
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I stayed at home for half a year

787
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
and finished my original script.

788
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Later,

789
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
the film was filmed,

790
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
aired and became popular.

791
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
It was a kind of

792
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
blessing in disguise.

793
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

794
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
To be honest,

795
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Wu Hao

796
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
was on a good level back then.

797
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
He was just

798
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
being rude to me

799
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
because of that.

800
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Right?

801
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
But now,

802
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
he's gone.

803
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm back.

804
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
Maybe I'm just

805
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
a little bit

806
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
evil-minded.

807
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
I just want him to see

808
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
how much he's worth.

809
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Besides being a bad person,

810
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
to be honest,

811
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
it's nice.

812
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
But sometimes,

813
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
I feel like

814
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
I'm pretty boring.

815
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
I don't know.

816
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I don't know what to do.

817
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Take your time.

818
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Okay.

819
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Luo Man,

820
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I know

821
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
I shouldn't say this,

822
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
but I can't help it.

823
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
To hold this breath,

824
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
you've spent time

825
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
and energy on it.

826
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Is it a bit unnecessary?

827
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Just like what you said,

828
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I know the truth,

829
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
but I still can't live a good life.

830
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I'm the one who's being scolded.

831
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I understand.

832
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Thank you.

833
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Get out early.

834
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I'm leaving.

835
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Bye.

836
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Bye.

837
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Bye.

838
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Do you remember Wu Hao?

839
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
We met recently.

840
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Do you think he...

841
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
He's a good guy.

842
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Don't think you're the best.

843
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Everyone thinks you wrote the script.

844
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
You can make up your own script.

845
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Ming Tian is here.

846
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Sister Man,

847
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
the director was talking about you.

848
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,500
Come on, I'll take you inside.

849
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Sister Man.

850
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Director De.

851
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm hot.

852
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Have you eaten?

853
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Your hand is stiff.

854
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Have you eaten?

855
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
No.

856
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Give me some.

857
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
It's a big bowl.

858
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Thank you.

859
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Sit.

860
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,500
New boyfriend?

861
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Ex-boyfriend?

862
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Back to the studio?

863
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
I'll go in.

864
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Eat.

865
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500
You're too fat.

866
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,500
You can't eat.

867
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
How can you talk?

868
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Is it because he's too fat?

869
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,500
That's why you two are fighting?

870
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
He wasn't like this when he was at home.

871
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Why are you laughing?

872
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I'm going on stage later.

873
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,500
You...

874
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
On stage?

875
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
You're going on stage in this?

876
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
What?

877
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
You're being too...

878
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
You're being too selfish.

879
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
At least,

880
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,500
put on a suit.

881
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
I'll be like this.

882
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
I'll be too self-conscious.

883
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
What time is it?

884
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,500
It's time to go in.

885
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
I'm going in.

886
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Wait for my video.

887
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Work out.

888
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Okay.

889
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Let's go.

890
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
Can I take a photo with the director?

891
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Ask the director.

892
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Can you?

893
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Come on.

894
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Don't stand under the light.

895
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
Use mine.

896
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Okay.

897
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,500
A little more.

898
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Be gentle.

899
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,500
A little more.

900
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
A little more.

901
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
One, two, three.

902
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
One, two, three.

903
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
Okay.

904
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Thank you.

905
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Is that the Empress?

906
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Is that the Empress?

907
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Yes.

908
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Does your job

909
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
often go with actors?

910
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,500
That's a follow-up.

911
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,500
I don't need it now.

912
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Your job is really annoying.

913
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
You can go on stage.

914
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
I'll be back.

915
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Is this the last year

916
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
of the...

917
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
I like that sound.

918
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,500
Is this the last year of the top six?

919
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
I'm sorry.

920
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm sorry.

921
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
What's the matter?

922
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
What's the matter?

923
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,500
What's the matter?

924
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
What's the matter?

925
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,500
What's the matter?

926
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,500
What's the matter?

927
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
What's the matter?

928
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,500
What's the matter?

929
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
What's the matter?

930
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
What's the matter?

931
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
What's the matter?

932
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
What's the matter?

933
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
What's the matter?

934
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
What's the matter?

935
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
What's the matter?

936
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
What's the matter?

937
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,500
What's the matter?

938
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,500
What's the matter?

939
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
What's the matter?

940
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
What's the matter?

941
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
What's the matter?

942
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
What's the matter?

943
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
What's the matter?

944
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
What's the matter?

945
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
What's the matter?

946
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
What's the matter?

947
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
What's the matter?
