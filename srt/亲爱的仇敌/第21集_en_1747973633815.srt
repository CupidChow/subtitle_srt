Don't you want to sue me?

Honey, can you be more considerate?

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
Can you be more considerate?

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
You dare to say

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,240
that your Zhang Jingmei is a bad guy.

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,240
But you're the one who has a baby.

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,440
Who told you that?

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,840

Aren't you afraid that I'll see it?

You're so stupid!

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Honey, I'm sorry.

41
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Really.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm really sorry.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
It's my fault.

44
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm really sorry. It's my fault.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Honey, I'm really sorry.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
No matter what,

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
we're two-mouthed.

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
We've been in a relationship for a long time.

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Honey, I beg you.

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Don't come near me.

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Let go of me!

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Honey,

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm sorry for being so rude.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,840
You're the only wife I have in my life.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,840
Please believe me.

56
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm begging you.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,840
What kind of a man is Zhang Jingmei?

58
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
Can I see him?

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm just being taken by him.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
I have no choice.

61
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,040
Honey,

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,440
it's my turn now.

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm begging you.

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,440
When I pass the obstacle,

65
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,640
I'll definitely clean it up.

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Then how is your family?

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
What do you mean?

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Honey, I know.

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
My dad is old.

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
He's confused.

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
Can I call him?

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
Honey, I'm begging you.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,040
Give me a few days.

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
I'll definitely give you an explanation.

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,640
Really?

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,440
I have a child.

77
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
How can I explain it to you?

78
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,440
Honey,

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,840
she's still here.

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,440
She's still here.

81
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
Don't laugh.

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
I beg you.

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,440
I beg you.

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,440
You're a little more sweet.

85
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,240
Honey, I'm begging you.

86
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,440
Give me a chance.

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,040
Can I?

88
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
I beg you.

89
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,240
Let go of me.

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Honey, let go of me.

91
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,240
Let go of me.

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,640
Let go of me.

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
Let go of me.

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
You think she will not come tomorrow?

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Go back to the foundation again.

99
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,440
Godimedia.

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,840
If I were her, I would do this.

101
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
What's her mom doing?

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
She's getting up late.

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
You can eat like this.

105
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Stop eating.

106
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
You can eat until you're full.

107
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Eat first.

108
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Sister, are you leaving today?

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm not leaving today.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I'll play with you for a day, okay?

111
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
We'll kick the ball after we finish our meal.

112
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
I have a class to attend to.

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
I'll talk to you later.

114
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Hello?

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Hello?

116
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
We're quite good.

117
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Don't... don't count.

118
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't know.

119
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Okay.

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
I'll talk to you later.

121
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Hello, dad?

122
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
Yes?

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Do you like the house?

124
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
It's good that you like it.

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
It's okay.

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
You can just pretend.

127
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Oh, right.

128
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
The garden in front of it

129
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
makes mom plant some vegetables and flowers.

130
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I'm also going to make a sunny house.

131
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
And there's a three-story house.

132
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
You can make tea.

133
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Yes.

134
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
It's very close to the fishing spot.

135
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Dad, don't save money for me.

136
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Really.

137
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Just draw it.

138
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Yes.

139
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
It's a little far from the city.

140
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
But it's okay.

141
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
But the garden in front of it

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
won't be steamed.

143
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
If you want to steam it,

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
just let it steam it.

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
You and mom

146
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
don't go to the fire because of this.

147
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Okay.

148
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Call me if you need anything.

149
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Okay.

150
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll give the phone to Kai Xi.

151
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Dad.

152
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Kai Xi.

153
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Chen Mian is doing a good job.

154
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Your mom is so happy.

155
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
She's going to the house later.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
She's going to see how to fix the house.

157
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Gao Qi is happy.

158
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
I know.

159
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm hanging up.

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Honey.

161
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
When we're done with the decoration,

162
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
we should go back.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
We haven't seen mom for a long time.

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Thank you.

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Did you help your dad?

166
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
It's still my son's dad.

167
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Right?

168
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Of course.

169
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
My wife will wait for me.

170
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Zhao.

171
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Are you okay?

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm fine.

173
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Your waist is not recovered yet.

174
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Sit down.

175
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Be careful.

176
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
You're all your own people.

177
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Why are you so stubborn?

178
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Drink some water.

179
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Come on.

180
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
What's up?

181
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Nothing.

182
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm fine.

183
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
But that Luo Man.

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I was already there that day.

185
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
You're so sad.

186
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
He seems to be

187
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
close to your cousin.

188
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Luo Man.

189
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,840
He's wearing Chen Kaixi's waist all day.

190
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm so upset.

191
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Now he's got a way.

192
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
But don't worry.

193
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
I'll fix my brother's waist.

194
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Zhao.

195
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
You know what's going on with me.

196
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm going to be in trouble.

197
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
I can't take it.

198
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Really?

199
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Really?

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
We're in the same boat now.

201
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Bro.

202
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
You really need to help me.

203
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
May I ride please?

204
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Please?

205
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
But isn't this Gel Broken?

206
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,040
I've already made it.

207
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
You've already made it?

208
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,440
How about this?

209
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Give me the menu first.

210
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I'll order the dishes first.

211
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,040
Okay?

212
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
We don't have a menu here.

213
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,240
Only three dishes on the signboard.

214
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,040
Baby, Su'er is late again.

215
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,240
Why don't you go and have a seat first?

216
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,040
I just told you.

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,840
Let's change the house.

218
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,640
There are too many rules.

219
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
We can't afford to sell it.

220
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
The most popular dish in the North Asia is

221
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,840
the potato dish made by the chef.

222
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,840
The most annoying dish in the kitchen.

223
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
What are you turning around for?

224
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,440
There's one more.

225
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,240
The chef is usually not good at cooking.

226
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
If you want to delay the relationship,

227
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,840
he can cook you a meal.

228
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,040
It's really hard.

229
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,440
Right.

230
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,840
We shouldn't compromise with this evil power.

231
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,440
Right.

232
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,640
Hello, please enjoy.

233
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Okay, thank you.

234
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm done.

235
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
Take a picture.

236
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,040
Wait a minute.

237
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Hello, sir.

238
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,840
Please enjoy.

239
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,640
Little Paxi.

240
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Hello, sir.

241
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,040
Please enjoy.

242
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,840
So, Mr. Zhou is here that day.

243
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,040
What does he mean?

244
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,640
What else can he mean?

245
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,040
He means

246
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,640
he just wants to tell me

247
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,840
that he and his ex-girlfriend

248
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
were not the first time we met.

249
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
Actually, it wasn't the first time.

250
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,440
Actually, he already noticed me.

251
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
So,

252
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,040
when we first had dinner,

253
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,640
he would cross the middle of the city

254
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,640
and choose me directly.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,240
That's what he meant.

256
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,240
Are you still a little bit heartless?

257
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
I'm not.

258
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,040
I'm just curious.

259
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
I want to know

260
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
how our next script

261
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,440
will be written by Mr. Zhou.

262
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm so curious.

263
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,040
I'm so curious.

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,240
I'm so curious.

265
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm so curious.

266
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm so curious.

267
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm so curious.

268
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
I'm so curious.

269
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Zhen Mi, I know what you mean.

270
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,840
You think you're the boss, right?

271
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
I can give you all the money.

272
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,440
I can get it back.

273
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
Do you understand?

274
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,840
I know.

275
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
I'll go in first.

276
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Brother.

277
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
You're here.

278
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,840
Breakfast.

279
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
Let's eat after finishing the meal.

280
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,640
My brother treats me well.

281
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm done.

282
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Don't go.

283
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Talk to me.

284
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,840
A few days ago,

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
my father made a video call to me.

286
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,640
Your mother was there that day.

287
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
She asked me

288
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,240
if I had a girlfriend.

289
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
She said she didn't dare to ask.

290
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,040
She was so anxious.

291
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
She just loves to worry.

292
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,440
It's not my fault.

293
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
It's a big thing in life.

294
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I can understand.

295
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
But, brother,

296
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,640
I'll tell you the truth.

297
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
It's important to choose the right person.

298
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Do you understand?

299
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I've seen so many rich guys

300
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,240
looking for them.

301
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,440
What's the day after?

302
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
It's a week.

303
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,640
It's so cruel.

304
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Brother,

305
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
your sister-in-law is good.

306
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,240
You should treat her better.

307
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,240
I know.

308
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
You can say it.

309
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,040
Your sister-in-law

310
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
always

311
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
treats her like her own child.

312
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,840
When necessary,

313
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,040
you can sacrifice yourself

314
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
to help your family.

315
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
You're a good woman.

316
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Do you understand?

317
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,040
But do you realize

318
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,240
that the girl now

319
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
is so good.

320
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
She's rich,

321
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
rich,

322
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,840
and self-sufficient.

323
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,640
Right?

324
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
She's got a lot of things.

325
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,840
She's got a lot of things.

326
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,640
Of course, I know

327
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,240
that women like her are interesting.

328
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,840
But even more interesting,

329
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
you're getting tired of her.

330
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,240
You're looking for your wife.

331
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,040
You're looking for your life.

332
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,640
You need to find a good wife.

333
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,240
By the way,

334
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
did the boss who sent you

335
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,840
last time

336
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
go to the hospital?

337
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,240
The house is the same as the woman's.

338
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
I have to take care of it.

339
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,840
Brother,

340
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,040
women are different from houses.

341
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,640
I rent a good house.

342
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
And I'm with you.

343
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,440
Xiyu.

344
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,640
What?

345
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
I told them to take care of it.

346
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
She must be waiting out there.

347
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,640
And I'm immediately going to give it to them.

348
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Then there are all the things

349
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,760
It'squee good good.

350
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,620
Who is in theStill volatile

351
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,160
Y contrary

352
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,840
Alright.

353
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,440
Listen to a board.

354
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,120
Sit down.

355
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,680
Streetiros

356
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
Tell me.

357
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,640
That's what my brother meant.

358
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,080
I didn't want it.

359
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,280
Why not?

360
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,440
You want a room.

361
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I'll take it if you want.

362
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,520
Besides,

363
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,480
the box of a room

364
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,600
that Cheng Mian can give you.

365
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,600
Are you stupid?

366
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,120
You've wronged me.

367
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,680
And

368
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
he's wronged you.

369
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
You're not like what he said.

370
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,440
What do you want me to do?

371
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
I'll listen to you.

372
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,600
You're serious and responsible.

373
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,240
You're a passionate person.

374
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,480
The outside world is warm and the inside world is old.

375
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
You're always dressed up and mature.

376
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
You're very smart.

377
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,080
Actually,

378
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,680
I'm just a fool.

379
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
Others say you used to eat aged fire pork on Вы Gaga,

380
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,840

You're Zongzi from the Johnsigue.

383
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
You're the only one who knows.

384
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,160
Stamp the Zongzi.

385
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,120
You have no reason.

386
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,280
You just can't let go of your heart.

387
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,800
Why are you helping him?

388
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,640
Fang Chi, come to the emergency room.

389
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,040
I'll be right there.

390
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,840
The presses were found.

391
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,400
They can't find it any more.

392
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Go back on your word.

393
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,200
Hello?

394
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,800

Come on.

397
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,600
Hurry up, stop the car.

398
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,760
Open the door immediately.

399
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,600
Go on.

400
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Follow them.

401
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Don't fall.

402
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,440
Relax.

403
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,640
Yes, Yes.

404
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,180
Please follow along.

405
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,500
Up there, come.

406
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,640
Push your leg forward.

407
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,260
Push your jack.

409
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,500
Be careful!

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,740
Move naughtily!

411
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,780
Let's talk in private.

412
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,540
Open the door.

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,220
This is all human's fate

415
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,700
It's a good and simple thing

416
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,880
It's more than living

417
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,380
It's our life

418
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
So beautiful

419
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,920
Ever since his death,

420
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,320
those who were behaviorists

421
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,200
and who makes you feel like a預備 soul

were executed to their power.

423
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,800
No matter how long you go

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,140
what the truth turns into

425
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,660
will just be undeniable.

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,080
Pretty June is

428
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,480
He grew up here.

429
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,940
Although I think

430
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,860
his past missing

I haven't anything wrong.

448
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,440
Lets go.

449
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,800
What do you mean?

450
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,720
Look at that,

452
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,840
Do you want me to help you?

453
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm in need of help.

454
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,480
Help you.

455
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,480
Are you기로?

456
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:57,100
Help me.

457
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,780
Help me.

458
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,780
Forget it. Go.

459
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,780
The End

460
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
The person you saved at that time

461
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
should have announced the death of Lin Chang.

462
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,980
But you continued to make him a heart-broken man.

463
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,380
Do you want to know why?

464
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,380
If we announce it at that time,

465
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,380
we will pull out the family.

466
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,980
He will be broken.

467
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,980
He saw that we didn't give up on saving the patient.

468
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,580
In his heart,

469
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,580
he might be able to make a good decision.

470
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,980
The master has shown you.

471
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,180
He said,

472
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,980
if we change him,

473
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
he will do the same.

474
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,380
In the end, the master is still angry with us.

475
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,380
He is still angry with us.

476
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,980
He is angry with us.

477
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,580
You have done a good job.

478
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,780
Really?

479
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,780
It's not enough.

480
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,980
The master just gave us a plate.

481
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
He analyzed all the problems.

482
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,780
He must have a proper way of handling them.

483
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,580
I feel

484
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,980
a little calm in my heart.

485
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,180
Next,

486
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,580
is the last question I asked.

487
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,380
It's also the first question I asked you when I was pregnant.

488
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,780
Why do you take it as a doctor?

489
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,380
I have a lot of doctors at home.

490
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,980
My parents don't want me to be a doctor.

491
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,780
Sometimes, I think about it.

492
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,180
What was it for?

493
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,780
I found out

494
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,580
that I really like being a doctor.

495
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,980
I think

496
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,180
people should respect their heart

497
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,980
and do what they should do.

498
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,180
When I was pregnant for the first time,

499
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
I didn't say anything.

500
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,580
Is it a new feeling?

501
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,380
When I was pregnant, I didn't say anything.

502
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,780
Is it a new feeling?

503
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,780
Mrs. Zhao,

504
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,380
I have something to tell you.

505
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,780
My brother and Zhang Fan

506
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,380
came to the hospital to do the body check.

507
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,580
I'll go to give them breakfast.

508
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,380
What kind of business is it?

509
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,580
Go and ask around.

510
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,180
If they can't get on,

511
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,380
they'll be in trouble.

512
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,180
Zhang Fan, what kind of bird are you?

513
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
What do you want to put in your heart?

514
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,380
You'll swallow it all.

515
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,980
I'm so bored.

516
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,580
Which side are you on?

517
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,780
Are you a fool?

518
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,380
Chen Wei, I know what you're talking about.

519
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Listen to me.

520
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,380
You think you're the boss, right?

521
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,380
Don't forget.

522
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,180
The result is all fake.

523
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,780
I know.

524
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,580
I can give you.

525
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
I can do anything.

526
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
I can get it all.

527
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,580
Do you hear me?

528
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,580
I know.

529
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
Go in.

530
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,380
Sister-in-law.

531
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,180
I don't understand

532
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
business.

533
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
But...

534
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,980
You should be more patient.

535
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,980
dign beat

536
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,980
She offered me after a while

537
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,020
to organize Zhang Fan's shares

538
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,780
with her company

539
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,980
and company coach come up with

540
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,900
a high- Vors centrif fingertip.

541
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,940
Ms. Chen,

542
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,340
your husband may be

543
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,980
signed the mutual Honda contract.

544
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,180
Zhang Fan Deep ster

545
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,240
ammonia

546
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,180
but, actually an ensemble coach.

547
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,380
And

548
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,300
It's possible that I signed it when I was on the company's business trip.

549
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,380
So you mean...

550
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,660
That is to say, I've been preventing you from doing anything

551
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,900
in case you're prepared.

552
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,420
Of course, I'm just guessing.

553
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,460
Without evidence, I can't do anything.

554
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,820
But this is not a big deal.

555
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,460
If Chen Mianlin and Xi Xi are going to be in the defense,

556
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,540
how could she not be in the defense of Zhang Fan?

557
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,020
How could she be willing to let Zhang Fan be her boss?

558
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,980
So there must be other interests between them.

559
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,900
Other interests?

560
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,460
Chen Mianlin has given himself a lot of insurance.

561
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,180
I'm so embarrassed to scold you. Are you stupid?

562
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,660
Have you ever thought about the consequences?

563
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,740
I thought you would support me.

564
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,180
I helped my sister-in-law.

565
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Yes, you're standing at Chen Kaixi's side. You helped him.

566
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,220

She's still smiling.

581
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,980

I saw it all.

593

I can tell you now.

595
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,420
Because I don't want to be a grown man like my brother.

596
