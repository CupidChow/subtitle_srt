do

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ooh, you

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ooh, ooh

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ooh, ooh, you

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ooh, ooh

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ooh, ooh

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ooh

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ooh

11
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ooh

12
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Ooh

13
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ooh

14
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Lao Jiang

15
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please sit down, Da Shuxing

16
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're the only one?

17
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Qingcheng will be here soon. Don't worry about Jiang Dao

18
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Peng is here. Writing a script

19
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah

20
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hello

21
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I told you

22
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Find the chief

23
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Find the chief

24
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

25
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

26
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're so angry

27
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm new to this job. I don't understand anything

28
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You always ask me questions

29
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you miss the former producer?

30
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you don't believe me, don't you think you're a businessman?

31
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I do

32
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

33
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's the situation with Boss Zhou?

34
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You two are friends. You're fighting over the wrong person

35
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're so cold

36
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't believe it's a matter of time

37
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's true

38
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The excellent young male director in China

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Observing the relationship between people is a game

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come on, I'll ask you a question

41
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Tell me the truth

42
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you think I have a game with Lao Zhou?

43
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It depends on you

44
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't do too much

45
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't even know how to live my life

46
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't do anything

47
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sister, I'm sorry

48
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hello, director

49
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sit down

50
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay

51
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Waiter, order please

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Come on

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you, director Jiang

54
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm so happy

55
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know the lunch is on the cheap side

56
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you

57
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're welcome

58
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're so thoughtful

60
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What have you been busy with lately?

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I've been reading some web dramas

62
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
A-Gen asked me to stick to that big one

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not that interesting

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm not that good

65
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The media is now too much of a shock to the film industry

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't help it

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can't remember the movie

68
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't remember the movie

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't remember the movie

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're so shocked

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't help it

72
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Since you can't resist the change of times

73
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can only hug it

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Come on, let's hug together

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Did you kill the scene you shot before?

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I just killed it

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was in the scene that day

78
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was forced to say a few words

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't worry about it

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No, no

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't remember the scene you shot before

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you have the clip from the previous scene?

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It looks good

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll have to look for it

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How about I send it to you next time?

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can eat first today

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Isn't it your birthday today?

88
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, right

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Isn't it your 40th birthday today?

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Come on, come on

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We have to toast

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the future of Chinese cinema

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Jiang Bao, the talented Jingfeng, the great Princess Zhan

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's so good

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's good that the agricultural industry is eliminated

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Jiang Bao is still a genius

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's a genius

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm touched, I'm touched, I'm touched

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You need to have a sense of ritual

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Cheers

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Come on, come on

103
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll send you the high-end later

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Boss, you still live there, right?

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Zhou Yicheng, where do you live?

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I live a little far away

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And this place must be especially blocked by the car

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't bother

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You go back yourself is also a block

111
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You have to learn from Lu Man

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He never treats me politely

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Last time I was in a hurry to go to the airport

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He just let me send him home

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Almost missed the time

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are you embarrassed about?

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're embarrassed to let me contact you to help you with the script

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Then you say I'm a fool

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Who are we looking for?

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You don't know who we're looking for

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You gave so little money

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Did you win?

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Blow it

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is there anyone in the neighborhood who wants to find someone?

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Then you have to get off the bridge in advance

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know how long it will take to go down

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you want to go to my house later?

128
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just to experience

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A family environment of a bottom-level film star

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Director, do you think

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
OK

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was in this room when I first came

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I haven't had this kind of life for a long time

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Here it is

135
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Come in

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Haven't been here before

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come in

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come on

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Almost there

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Come on

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
901 central car

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What's up?

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:29,960
There's a

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's okay, you shake it

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm also curious what you can shake

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But can you let my friends in first?

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can come in if you have something

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry, let me

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sorry, sorry

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Come on, come on

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He went there

154
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This ability to check

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Compared with him

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I am a waste

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Put on your shoes

158
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Come in

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Once again

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Even the hotel is not the same

161
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This time

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Won't it be your own brother?

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Who of you has a better language resistance?

164
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't say those kind of things

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Tell me what's going on

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Teacher, he told me this

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do you think I can respond to him?

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Mrs. Chen

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Your situation is indeed a bit complicated

170
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This Saturday

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We will have a emotional tour

172
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He is our teacher

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Very powerful

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I will report to you

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
His one-on-one tutoring class

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The price is the internal price of the member

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
98,000

178
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The IQ is already a lot

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Still have to add 100,000

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's like this, Mrs. Chen

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I just hope you can feel it

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
In this marriage

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You are not alone

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
In my marriage

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There are already enough people

187
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Please take care

188
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You give us back Brother Huang's watch

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We will leave immediately

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What watch?

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You are not interested in Zhaizhongsheng

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Huang Guoduo lost his mind

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You two went into the room

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,980
He still has a

195
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Ritual secret

196
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
The water is not right

197
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,980
What else do you have?

198
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
I'm so sorry

199
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
This watch is really not with me

200
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
If you buy the watch

201
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
It's okay

202
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
In this way

203
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
The price is 235,000

204
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,980
I'll give you a head massage

205
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Two hundred thousand

206
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Spit it out for me

207
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,980
I didn't take the watch

208
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
I only tell you once

209
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
You know Huang Guoduo

210
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
I am now talking to you

211
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,980
If you don't see me again

212
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
I will be the father

213
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,980
I'm sorry

214
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,980
You continue

215
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
Hello

216
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
The number you have dialed is busy

217
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Please call later

218
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm talking to you

219
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
Huang Guoduo is a man of the heart

220
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
You know it

221
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
If you keep this, you will never go back

222
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
I'm sorry

223
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,980
I want to ask you something

224
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,980
This kind of experience

225
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
Usually at least ten years

226
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
If I let him stay inside

227
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Say hello

228
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
Listen

229
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
You are still not dead in there

230
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Oh

231
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,980
How did I say I was familiar

232
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Isn't this a big director

233
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Such a big director in your family

234
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
It seems that you know how to have fun

235
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Let's put this black stuff down

236
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
I don't think it will go down

237
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
He's still in the mood

238
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
I can't stand it

239
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
The people in your group

240
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
I can't stand it

241
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,980
I didn't want to mention it

242
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
But your attitude

243
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
I can't even mention it

244
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
I can't even mention it

245
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Brother

246
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,980
I'm sorry, brother

247
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

248
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Can you let me go

249
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm alone in the field

250
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Unreliable

251
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
I really didn't take that Huang brother's watch

252
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
I really didn't take it

253
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
I beg you to let me go

254
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

255
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Where is Huang brother

256
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
Can you find him

257
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,980
I can tell him

258
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Are you his brother

259
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
I

260
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
I

261
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
I'm his brother

262
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Do you know his father

263
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
My father

264
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Do you know our grandfather

265
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
You check it first

266
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
Check what our family is doing

267
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980
Our grandfather

268
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
You check it first

269
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
No no no

270
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Laosui

271
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
I tell you

272
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
We get one person

273
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
It's the same as getting two people

274
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Almost okay

275
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
Really want to do it

276
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,980
Legal society

277
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
I really thought a few harsh words

278
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,980
Can make people angry

279
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
What's the use of handing it out

280
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
I've sent it out

281
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
You can still cut the Internet

282
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
How many times have I said

283
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
I didn't take Huang brother's watch

284
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
You have to find someone to go out and find

285
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
I am a small actor without a name

286
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
You are all people with heads and faces

287
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Just those videos sent out

288
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
I died first or you died first

289
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,980
Think about it yourself

290
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,980
I think it makes sense

291
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
I'm young

292
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Think about it

293
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
For your good

294
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,980
Really

295
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Still not leaving

296
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Still standing here

297
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
I've already told you

298
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Take the watch back

299
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
And be scolded by him

300
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
He really doesn't know what my dad did

301
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
What do you say

302
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
I need this hammer

303
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
You say

304
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
Where is the person

305
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Come back

306
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Why are you so loud

307
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,980
You are not here yet

308
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
I

309
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,980
I

310
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
Today's friend circle

311
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
Set a good mood

312
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Come to the city to play the wind

313
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Happy second round

314
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
One season hit

315
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
A little bit of a fairy little star

316
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
The air is filled up

317
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Stay at the Vipshop

318
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
You can also go to the door for free

319
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
Go to the Vipshop

320
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Search for your favorite big brand clothes

321
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Buy three

322
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Sorry

323
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
There is only this tea at home

324
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Nothing

325
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
What kind of people are those people?

326
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
I feel like

327
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
It seems that the brain is not very normal

328
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
I didn't scare you

329
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
No

330
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
That watch

331
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
It's you

332
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
I'm crazy

333
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Why do I take his watch

334
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Then why did they recognize you

335
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Bad luck

336
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
So mysterious

337
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
I sleep

338
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Sorry

339
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
I'm a trouble to you

340
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,980
I've already rented the house

341
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
You should find a place to hide

342
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Come

343
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
They are really too ignorant

344
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
Too bully

345
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
But I really didn't take that watch

346
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Qin Chen, you believe me

347
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
You go

348
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Don't use my name again

349
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
I'm going to sleep

350
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Dad, is your family okay?

351
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
Of course

352
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
What's wrong?

353
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Is your family okay?

354
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
Even if your family is okay

355
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,980
You don't ask Zhong Qingcheng if it's okay

356
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,980
I'm kind

357
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Once the three of them are looking for you

358
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,980
I don't want to protect you

359
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Why is the big eye so attached to the Western Regions now?

360
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
I didn't find it before

361
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Luo Man

362
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,980
Luo Man

363
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Are you okay?

364
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,980
Where are those people?

365
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
I called the police for you

366
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Why are you calling the police?

367
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
I saw the video you sent me

368
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
You are so deep

369
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
You sent me a video

370
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
I didn't say a word

371
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,980
I was so scared

372
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,980
It's okay

373
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
Take the police away

374
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Don't bother the police

375
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
They are all gone

376
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
You don't know

377
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
It was a big show just now

378
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
I'll be in your car later

379
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm really sick

380
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
I'll perform for you

381
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Okay

382
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Then Director Jiang

383
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
Don't be sorry

384
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
The three of us will leave first

385
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Okay?

386
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
Director

387
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
I'm sorry

388
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
It's a big trouble for you today

389
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
I didn't even let you celebrate your birthday

390
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
It's okay

391
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
You did a good job

392
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Remember to cut the rest of the video

393
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
Okay

394
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,980
Let's go

395
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Let's go

396
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
What's going on?

397
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,980
I won't be able to leave

398
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,980
I'm afraid of the corner of my eyes

399
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:27,980
It's not a good answer

400
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Go away, don't force yourself

401
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Go away, don't force yourself

402
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
Lin Wo

403
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
You beauty

404
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Come with me

405
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
I'm not going

406
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
You are

407
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
You are all red

408
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
You are so pretty

409
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
I'm not pretty

410
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
How about I play a game with you?

411
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
Give it to me

412
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,980
I got it from this place

413
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
I'll return it to this place

414
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
I'm leaving

415
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
I'm in a hurry to get my script

416
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
My house is a little messy

417
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
Don't mind it

418
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Why don't you go to my house?

419
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
I'm in the school safety

420
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Will they find me here?

421
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
How is that possible?

422
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
They don't know who I am

423
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Where can they find me?

424
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Don't worry, it's okay

425
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Change slippers

426
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,980
The sofa and carpet can be used

427
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
You can use whatever you want

428
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
I'll change my clothes

429
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Older sisters

430
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
How about a small cup?

431
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Sure

432
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Thank you two sisters for helping me today

433
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Actually, this is the kind of thing

434
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,980
I'm used to moving from one place to another

435
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
But this time it's different

436
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Someone is with me

437
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
Someone is picking me up

438
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
It's pretty romantic

439
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
Are you stupid?

440
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
I just hope that this kind of scary thing

441
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Don't happen again

442
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,980
When I ran over today

443
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
I was wondering

444
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Will you be on the hot search tomorrow?

445
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
I forgot to tell you

446
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Who let you come here alone?

447
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Aren't you afraid of danger?

448
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Just call the police

449
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
And it's no use for you to come

450
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
I have money

451
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Money can solve a lot of problems

452
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
That's right

453
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Come

454
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Who am I?

455
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
You're pretty over the top

456
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
I'm sorry

457
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,980
But I've been thinking about him

458
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
I was wondering

459
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
What is he doing now?

460
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,980
What will he do tomorrow?

461
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
What will happen next?

462
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Maybe he'll go back to his hometown

463
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Actually, I've seen a lot of girls like this

464
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,980
They came to the city of Yan empty-handed

465
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Wanting to get the real thing

466
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Then they got in trouble

467
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
And went back to their hometown empty-handed

468
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
It's normal

469
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,980
I went to the West Station a few days ago

470
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
I wanted to experience life

471
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,980
But I saw a lot of people in the train again

472
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
But I realized that day

473
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Actually, there are people on the train you left

474
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
There are people

475
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,980
I couldn't help thinking

476
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
You said

477
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Maybe one day

478
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
I won't be able to stay

479
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
I'll leave here

480
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,980
And I'll leave like Tang Mi

481
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
I can't keep anything

482
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
Nothing

483
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
Wait, wait, wait

484
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Enough, enough, enough

485
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,980
You're pretty, hard-working, and good-looking

486
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
I'll leave it at that

487
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,980
You'll be the top sooner or later

488
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
I will

489
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Actually, I understand what you're saying

490
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
When I first came to Yan

491
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
I thought

492
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
Why is this city so big?

493
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,980
Why am I so small?

494
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Do you know what time I was most afraid of?

495
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
What time?

496
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
It was 6 or 7 p.m.

497
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
On the way today

498
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
You see everyone is busy

499
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Buying food, buying food

500
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Taking care of children, taking care of children

501
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
Hurrying to the road

502
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Everyone is in a hurry to go home

503
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
What about me?

504
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I don't have a home

505
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Even though it seems to be a bit colorful now

506
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
But I still have this feeling

507
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Just

508
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
I feel like I'm a guest in this city

509
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,980
But then I found a way

510
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
Every time I get up

511
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
When I get up

512
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,980
Hurry up and turn on the power

513
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Start writing

514
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
Write, write

515
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
I walked into my own creation

516
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
In that little world

517
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,980
Then this emotion came out

518
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Just take it out

519
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
It's okay

520
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
When I just got better

521
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
I remember once

522
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,980
One night

523
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,980
I knocked over 25,700 times

524
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,980
My hands were swollen so high

525
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
You are so difficult

526
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
Why didn't you tell me?

527
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
What to say

528
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
I understood one thing at that time

529
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Some bitterness

530
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,980
Must be self-examined

531
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,980
Just like my dad said

532
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,980
I found all this by myself

533
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
I deserve this

534
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Do you have this feeling?

535
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,980
Especially after coming to the city

536
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
You will feel

537
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
I'm not bad at anything

538
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
Right?

539
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
I have to get out of the way

540
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
I have to have what you have

541
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,980
I don't know where this blind confidence comes from

542
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Just go forward

543
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Just go forward

544
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
But you go home alone

545
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Sometimes you lie on the bed

546
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
You will think

547
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
I feel like I am nothing

548
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,980
This is not as good as others

549
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,980
That is not as good as others

550
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Maybe just like my dad said

551
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Too high level

552
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Limitable

553
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
Don't think so

554
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,980
You are not so bad with Mr. Zhou recently

555
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Zhou?

556
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Do you remember

557
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
You asked me what happened in the car

558
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,980
I said I didn't get in

559
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
I didn't say anything

560
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Actually I didn't mean to tell you

561
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,980
I really don't know how to say it

562
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Just

563
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
When I was with him

564
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
I was fine

565
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,980
I was very tired

566
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,980
But you always feel like you are not close to him

567
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
When you are with him

568
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,980
You have to guess him

569
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
You have to be careful

570
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
This feeling makes me not so comfortable

571
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,980
Sometimes I feel so tired

572
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
I am exhausted

573
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Let's stop here

574
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Come

575
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
You don't have to drink, I will drink

576
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Why?

577
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
I have to apologize to you

578
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
Maybe

579
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
I am too sad with Mr. Zhou

580
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
So

581
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
Sometimes I feel like

582
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
You are the one who found me

583
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
So I have to apologize to you

584
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
After all, you are doing well

585
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,980
Right?

586
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Yes

587
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
They are so silly

588
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,980
I feel so lonely

589
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
I feel so lonely

590
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Do you know

591
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
It's a kind of pain to have nothing

592
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,980
It's a kind of pain to have everything

593
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
You should be scolded for saying this

594
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,980
You are so strict

595
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
No, I am not being annoying

596
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,980
I have a conversation with Chen Ming

597
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
It's quite interesting

598
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,980
One night he came home and told me

599
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
He knew a man

600
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
He was 46 years old and left

601
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
He is 36 years old now

602
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
He has 10 years left

603
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
He told me directly

604
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
He wanted to play outside for 10 years

605
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
He told me not to care about him

606
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,980
He promised that he would come home after 10 years

607
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
You didn't see his expression

608
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
He was so stubborn

609
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,980
I felt like I didn't understand him

610
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
I know

611
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
You told me that

612
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,980
You are 30 years old now

613
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
You know it's already good luck

614
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
How many families are missing this every day?

615
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
Right?

616
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,980
Actually, I want to start a business now

617
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Not to let my husband look down on me

618
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,980
Not to think that I am so stupid

619
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,980
I just want to do something for myself

620
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,980
I want to prove that I am worth it

621
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
What are you doing?

622
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Don't worry

623
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,980
You don't need to prove that you are worth it

624
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Come on

625
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
Let's drink

626
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
For what?

627
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Life is so hard

628
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
Luckily we have women

629
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Luckily we have women

630
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Luckily we have women

631
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Luckily we have women

632
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
It's so hard

633
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
It's so hard

634
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,980
Zhou Muxun

635
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,980
I think he is a new level of test paper for me

636
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
It's so hard

637
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
It's so hard

638
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,980
Now I am just a test paper

639
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
I am just a test paper

640
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
I am just a test paper

641
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,980
Now I am just a little bit

642
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
I can't find myself

643
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,980
I am so unruly

644
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
I am so stubborn

645
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
I don't like myself like this

646
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
I don't know what to do

647
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Men are so stingy

648
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,980
The more you don't treat him well, the more he will be sad

649
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Don't think about getting him

650
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Give him a chance

651
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Let him think about getting you

652
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
I will get him

653
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Open your eyes

654
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
You can write a script

655
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
You can write a script

656
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Open your eyes

657
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
I knew it

658
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,980
Luo Man is so good

659
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Luo Man is so good

660
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Luo Man

661
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,980
Do you have any new ideas about the next story?

662
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
I want to say

663
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,980
The story is about the emotional pulling of an adult

664
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
Pulling and pulling

665
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
You have to pull to pull

666
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,980
So if the hero is always in the mood

667
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
I don't think I understand

668
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
We can let

669
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
What's wrong with the big one?

670
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Come in

671
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Look

672
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Double heat search

673
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
I can't see

674
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Why did you shoot me so well?

675
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
I'm sorry

676
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,980
It's a pity

677
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980
If it was when we were in the play

678
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,980
We could have been a little hot

679
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,980
Yes

680
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Then we continue

681
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,980
So what I want to say is

682
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
At the first stage

683
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Let the hero go back to the mirror first

684
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
Sorry

685
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
I'll send you the new concept

686
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
it is good

687
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Come for dinner tonight

688
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
You don't eat

689
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Where did you come back from?

690
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Didn't I send you a photo?

691
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,980
Hong Kong

692
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
I had a meeting that time

693
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Did not pay attention

694
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
I knew you were going to Hong Kong

695
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
I asked you to bring me some skin care products

696
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Test

697
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,980
If you can write more than one thousand words every day

698
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
You don't have to worry about this sleep

699
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,980
I ate the reaction of the director Zhou

700
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
Hey, put

701
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Don't go

702
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
I won't help you with this kind of work

703
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Whose project?

704
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,980
OK, OK, OK

705
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
Don't touch the stinky feet

706
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
Last time

707
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
OK, bye

708
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
There is a chicken sausage in the teeth

709
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
I'll go after eating

710
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
Now?

711
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
It's almost ten o'clock

712
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
There is no way

713
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
They are going to shoot tomorrow

714
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
You do this

715
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
If I get too late

716
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
I'll go back to my own house

717
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Don't wait for me

718
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Don't eat

719
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
I'm leaving

720
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
You wear this

721
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Where are you going?

722
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Send you

723
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Send me?

724
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
No need

725
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
I can call a bus

726
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
It's too late

727
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
I'm late

728
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Go

729
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Why do you ask me to come here?

730
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
The crew all live here

731
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Of course, the stars don't have to live here

732
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Thank you, thank you

733
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
I'm grateful

734
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Don't come here, Mr. Xu

735
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
Boss Zhou

736
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
I'm fine

737
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Send him away

738
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Do whatever you want

739
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
It's boring to make jokes here

740
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Such a big director lives here?

741
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
The platform is effective

742
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
To be honest

743
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,980
It's possible that you have to run and eat grass

744
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
Right?

745
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
So, Mr. Zhou

746
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
If you want to be in the play

747
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Please don't be stingy

748
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
Where is your assistant director?

749
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
He went to buy coffee

750
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
You are famous

751
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
I can't think without coffee

752
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
Come on, let's start

753
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
Start, start

754
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,980
The love story of the leading man and woman

755
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,980
After they get better

756
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
The elevator is not long

757
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,980
I really thought about a lot of ways

758
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
I just think it's not good

759
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
How can I make this play look good?

760
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
Ordinary good looks are like that

761
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,980
Lass feeling

762
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,980
And then it's refreshing

763
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
And ambiguous

764
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Right?

765
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Then

766
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
You let the two people stand in a row

767
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
The leading man was supposed to hold the leading woman's hand

768
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Suddenly the elevator door opened

769
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Then a person came in and compressed the space

770
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
Then the distance was close

771
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Then this person is the person they knew

772
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Then the leading man still secretly

773
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
Hold the leading woman's hand

774
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Or

775
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Just don't hold hands

776
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Just let the little finger like this

777
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Hook his little finger

778
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
What about this?

779
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
I have a feeling

780
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
What is that word?

781
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
This is

782
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Heart rate

783
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Yes, yes, yes

784
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Heart rate

785
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
You know me too well

786
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
Can you finish your man's play?

787
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Such a complicated play

788
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Who?

789
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Come in, let's go to the coffee shop

790
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
I'll get it

791
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
Thank you

792
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
You take one

793
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
Thank you

794
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,980
Just a little

795
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Or

796
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
You go back first

797
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
We still have a lot to do

798
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,980
It's a long time and it's boring

799
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Nothing

800
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
I'm listening

801
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
It's interesting

802
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
You talk first, don't care about me

803
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
Where else is the card?

804
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
No, it's still that one

805
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Is there

806
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Is there anything different?

807
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Come on, get up

808
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,980
Great, this play is great

809
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,980
This play is worth at least 100,000

810
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,980
Then you give me big money

811
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,980
Blow up the machine

812
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,980
How many more?

813
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
This one

814
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Weekend date

815
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
Your police are too loose

816
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
What should I do?

817
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Basically, the police have already been set

818
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
I'm going to go to the police station

819
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
I'll go to the police station

820
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,980
I'll go to the police station

821
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
I'll go to the police station

822
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
I'll go to the police station

823
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
Basically, the police have been set

824
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
The phone is out of battery

825
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
Jiangdao, what time is it?

826
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
Are you still paying attention to the labor union?

827
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Let the screenwriter go home to sleep

828
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
There are still a few more, I'll finish it

829
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Not much

830
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
You can go back first

831
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,980
If it's too late

832
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,980
I'll go back to my own home

833
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Then you guys go ahead

834
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,980
Take care

835
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
Didn't I tell you to go back?

836
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
I'll go back

837
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
Safe?

838
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
What's wrong?

839
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
I sent you a message, but you didn't reply

840
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
Did I send it?

841
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,980
I was talking about it

842
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,980
I didn't look at my phone

843
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
Just talk like this

844
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,980
How much did he pay you?

845
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
What money?

846
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
The friend is there

847
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
At most, it's just a meal

848
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
That's about it

849
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
Then you go back to your home

850
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
I'll go back

851
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,980
I'll go back

852
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,980
I'll go back

853
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,980
I'll go back

854
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I'll go back

855
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,980
I'll go back

856
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,980
I'll go back

857
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
Then what are you doing?

858
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
Is maintaining this kind of relationship

859
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
Any good for you?

860
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,980
At least in my opinion

861
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,980
In all work relationships

862
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Self-reducing, selling services

863
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,980
It's useless to yourself

864
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,980
It's all for nothing

865
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Why are you so bad at saying things?

866
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,980
What is self-reducing, selling services?

867
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
That's not true

868
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
Moreover

869
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,980
Me and Jia Yang are not purely work relationships

870
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
We are friends

871
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
When I first entered the industry

872
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
I didn't know anyone

873
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,980
He really helped me a lot

874
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
He didn't have to pay back

875
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Now I have the ability

876
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,980
Help others

877
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,980
I know

878
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,980
I mean, I'll be busy in the future

879
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,980
Don't help me

880
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Fall off the shelf

881
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
Why are you so impatient?

882
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,360
I've been looking for a

883
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,980
G-tube all night

884
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
Maybe that one is coming

885
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
And I'm angry with you

886
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,980
What?

887
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,980
Open it

888
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,980
I won't

889
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,980
When did you buy it?

890
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
It's not that you've been

891
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,980
Wrapping your waist all the way

892
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,980
Uncomfortable

893
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
I've been looking for a

894
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:46,980
G-tube all night

895
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
Maybe that one is coming

896
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
And I'm angry with you

897
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,980
Fall off the shelf

898
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,980
I won't

899
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,980
Open it

900
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,980
I won't

901
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,980
Open it

902
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,980
I won't

903
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,980
Open it

904
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,980
I won't

905
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
Open it

906
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,980
Open it

907
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,980
Open it

908
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,980
Open it

909
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,980
Open it

910
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,980
Open it

911
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,980
So careful

912
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,980
When you're not feeling well

913
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
You should work less

914
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,980
Right?

915
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,980
Oh, right

916
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
I've cleaned up the left drawer

917
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,980
For you

918
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,980
What?

919
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,980
I need something to help you

920
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,980
You've been helping me

921
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
For so long

922
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Why is it not enough?

923
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Our profession is like this

924
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,980
It's hard to work

925
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,980
When you help people

926
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
You can do it

927
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,980
You can do it all

928
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,980
I'm not a writer

929
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,980
He only knows you

930
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,980
As a writer

931
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,980
He can't

932
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,980
Just let you do it

933
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,980
All by yourself

934
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,980
What's wrong with you?

935
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,980
Just tell me

936
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
You don't like me

937
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
To help you

938
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
Or you don't like me

939
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,980
To help Jiangya?

940
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,980
You can tell me

941
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,980
If you're jealous

942
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,980
It's not embarrassing

943
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,980
Do I look like I'm jealous?

944
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,980
Yes

945
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Of course

946
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
You're not jealous

947
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,980
You're pretending to be jealous

948
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,980
You said

949
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,980
You don't like

950
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,980
That kind of relationship

951
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,980
That kind of relationship

952
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Where I go out with a man

953
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
And you pretend to be jealous

954
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,980
You don't like that

955
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,980
No

956
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,980
I think Meiyu

957
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,980
Has gone too far

958
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,980
I just don't want you

959
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,980
To be spoiled by her for nothing

960
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,980
But

961
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,980
Just in case you're jealous

962
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,980
I'll explain it to you

963
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,980
Jiangya and I

964
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,980
We're really nothing

965
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
If there's anything

966
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,980
There's already something

967
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,980
You're standing here now

968
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,980
It's not the two of us

969
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,980
Right?

970
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,980
And also

971
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,980
I think Zhou

972
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,980
You can't learn

973
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,980
My bad habits

974
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,980
It's

975
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,980
You want it, you want it, you want it

976
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
And then you can't do this

977
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
You can't do that either

978
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
Right?

979
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,980
You said

980
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,980
The way you get along with me now

981
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,980
Is the most comfortable

982
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
The most suitable

983
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,980
Look

984
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,980
I've never seen your friends

985
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,980
And you've never seen my friends

986
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,980
And then

987
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,980
I still don't know

988
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,980
Your password

989
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,980
Every time you're going on a business trip

990
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,980
You want to get me out of bed at eight o'clock

991
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,980
Actually, these things

992
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
I don't feel comfortable

993
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
But because you feel comfortable

994
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,980
So I chose to be patient

995
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,980
But you can't be the only one

996
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,980
Happy, right?

997
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,980
So in some details

998
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,980
I make you feel uncomfortable

999
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,980
Then please

1000
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,980
Bear with it

1001
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,980
Okay?

1002
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
The car is here, I'm going downstairs

1003
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
You want me to meet your friend

1004
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,980
Or

1005
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,980
You want to meet my friend

1006
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,980
Yours

1007
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:40,980
You call her Luo

1008
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,980
Luo

1009
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,980
Yes, I usually call her teacher Luo

1010
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,980
Okay

1011
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,980
Come on

1012
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,980
Come on, cheers

1013
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,980
Let's have a drink together

1014
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,980
Yes, have a drink

1015
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,980
Okay

1016
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,980
Not bad

1017
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,980
I'll drink with you

1018
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,980
Okay

1019
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,980
Thank you

1020
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,980
Thank you

1021
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,980
So Mr. Huang is your first boss

1022
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,980
I knew him when I was studying at school

1023
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,980
We've been friends for more than ten years

1024
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,980
He's been taking care of me

1025
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,980
At least more than my dad

1026
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
I just didn't expect

1027
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
What did you not expect?

1028
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,980
I didn't expect

1029
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,980
That

1030
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,980
The first friend you brought me to meet

1031
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Is

1032
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,980
A serious relationship

1033
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,980
Is it hard to imagine?

1034
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,980
So

1035
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:46,980
It's a surprise

1036
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,980
I'm envious of Mr. Huang and his wife

1037
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,980
I didn't expect

1038
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,980
They've been so close for so many years

1039
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,980
Actually, they

1040
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,980
Have had other people

1041
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,980
They've thought about divorcing

1042
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,980
But the key is

1043
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
They had a serious illness

1044
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,980
It doesn't matter if they live or die

1045
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
I understand

1046
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,980
It's just

1047
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:23,980
There's a little intimate relationship

1048
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,980
It's not something you can change

1049
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,980
What's in here?

1050
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,980
Wen Man

1051
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,980
Do you think

1052
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,980
You know me?

1053
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,980
I know you like me

1054
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,980
Is it possible

1055
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,980
That you like

1056
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,980
Just one side of me?

1057
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,980
And it's exactly the best side of me

1058
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,980
I might be like all the tired middle-aged men

1059
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,980
Tired

1060
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,980
I'm tired every day

1061
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,980
I'm tired every day

1062
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,980
I'm tired every day

1063
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,980
I'm tired every day

1064
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,980
I usually want to drink something at home

1065
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,980
See something and then sleep

1066
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,980
I may not be able to

1067
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,980
It's not possible

1068
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,980
I can't keep giving you

1069
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,980
The feeling of love

1070
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,980
So?

1071
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,980
I live alone

1072
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,980
Simply because I enjoy myself

1073
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,980
I feel like I'm alone

1074
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,980
In a space

1075
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,980
I think maybe

1076
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,980
So many years

1077
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,980
I lack the impetus to take care of others

1078
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,980
And I don't have any wishes to be taken care of

1079
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,980
Really?

1080
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,980
Really?

1081
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,980
Is there anything to eat near your school?

1082
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
I'm hungry

1083
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,980
Let's go

1084
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,980
This is your favorite flavor

1085
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:02,980
Is it good?

1086
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,980
It's delicious

1087
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,980
What's wrong?

1088
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
I'll buy you another bowl

1089
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,980
You will have to take a train to Shenzhen in a few hours

1090
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,980
And there's nothing to eat in the train

1091
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,980
You can't handle it

1092
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,980
Enough

1093
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980
I'll buy another bowl

1094
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,980
How about two steamed buns?

1095
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,980
These two are quite expensive

1096
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,980
They are all sweet and sour

1097
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,980
And the buns are very thin

1098
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,980
Okay

1099
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
My roommate took the exam for me

1100
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,980
I was arrested

1101
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,980
The school informed me to fire him

1102
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,980
His father came to pick him up and take him home

1103
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,980
Actually

1104
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,980
Actually, that job was mine

1105
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,980
Maybe I just have some intuition

1106
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,980
I didn't feel safe at that time

1107
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,980
And I got this job from him

1108
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,980
He is the same as me

1109
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,980
He has a bad family

1110
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,980
He did everything for you

1111
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:47,980
Did you pack your things well?

1112
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,980
Or I can help you take them down

1113
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,980
I got both of them

1114
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,980
If you don't do it well, you can't get the important things

1115
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Come on

1116
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,980
A drink

1117
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,980
Okay

1118
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,980
Thank you

1119
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,980
I'm sorry

1120
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,980
If it wasn't for the bad luck

1121
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,980
I might be the one who was swallowed

1122
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,980
It's me

1123
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,980
The quiet life

1124
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,980
Even if it becomes a breeze

1125
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,980
The life is as long as the river

1126
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,980
The world is so beautiful

1127
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,980
The most beautiful thing when you look back

1128
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,980
Is to face your own

1129
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,980
Regret or regret

1130
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:22,980
I clearly saw the moonlight

1131
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
It's so bright in the entrance

1132
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,980
The world is so beautiful

1133
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:41,980
The most beautiful thing when you look back

1134
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,980
I finally learned something

1135
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,980
The reason for the beginning and the end

1136
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,980
There is no short cut

1137
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,980
I clearly saw the moonlight

1138
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,980
It's so bright in the entrance

1139
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,980
The world is so beautiful

1140
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:45,980
The most beautiful thing when you look back

1141
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,980
The world is so beautiful

1142
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,980
The most beautiful thing when you look back

1143
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,980
The reason for the beginning and the end

1144
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,980
The life is as long as the river

1145
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:14,980
Regret or regret

1146
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,980
I clearly saw the moonlight

1147
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,980
The world is so beautiful

1148
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:57,980
The most beautiful thing when you look back

1149
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:04,980
The world is so beautiful

1150
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:10,980
终究有一天能学会

1151
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:16,980
孤绝和悲绝无所谓

1152
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:22,980
生命终会走到结尾

1153
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:28,980
无论你配不配

1154
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:35,980
感谢每一天都在做

1155
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:41,980
让自己就好了那个

1156
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:48,980
陪着生命从头到尾

1157
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:56,980
怎样没想到是我

1158
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,980
