1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Energy

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
do

4
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
yeah

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In fact, this is a kind of invitation

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Think about it

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For the rich

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The most important thing is time

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He is willing to spend a long time

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Make a game with you

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And build something together

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't you think this is a very romantic invitation?

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So the question is

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why do you think this is a kind of humiliation?

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can't say it's humiliation

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Forget it

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ok, let me be frank

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't like it

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Does it sound good?

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Can I not like my birthday gift?

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have the right to do that

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What do you know?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I thought I understood you

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I thought you were different from other women

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm the same

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you know when I feel the happiest when I'm with you?

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When?

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Many times I feel understood when I'm with you

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you saying this a little too much?

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Do I have to do this on my birthday?

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I gave you a gift on your birthday

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A gift you don't like

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So tired

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You should go back and rest early

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Whatever you want to do

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What gift did you receive?

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Buy something you like

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have a feeling

46
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You and him

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Will never get better

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
New episode, please check it out

49
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry

50
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry

51
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry

52
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry

53
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hello

54
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm very happy to be on your show

55
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I didn't expect this episode to be on the news

56
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't think it's very talkative

57
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why did it get on the news?

58
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The click rate has risen

59
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It has risen tens of thousands

60
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yesterday

61
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
When they came to me

62
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I thought it was a fraud group

63
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's good that it got on the news

64
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Did you read the interview question?

65
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think it's quite deep

66
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But I don't know how to answer some questions

67
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Help me think about it

68
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't worry

69
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I like the title

70
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The career rabbit of the full-time owner

71
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's in the kitchen, but not only in the kitchen

72
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're so thoughtful

73
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
By the way

74
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a big deal for you to go to the store

75
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Did you tell Chen Pian?

76
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You know what he's like

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What is to make a fortune

78
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't like it

79
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to wear this brand

80
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's the old-fashioned

81
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And very tasteful

82
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A lot of rich people can't wear it

83
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But my family, Xixi

84
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Only you can wear it

85
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Is it?

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is it?

87
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
By the way, the review of the owner is quite good

88
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can ask him to help you choose clothes

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hello

90
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You mean the old-fashioned?

91
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The custody, right?

92
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But the child is so small

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You have a good chance to win custody

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay, don't worry

95
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll go to the store

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you going to file a divorce lawsuit for Li Wei'an?

97
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Are you crazy?

98
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know Chen Pian and that rich man

99
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They have such a good relationship

100
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But Chen Pian knows that you two are going to fight again

101
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't get excited

102
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What can I do?

103
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I have the custody of the child

104
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Li Wei'an is not only a single woman

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She can't even see the child

106
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If you were her

107
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How would you live?

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I can live in any way

109
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's not your turn to be her guardian

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What do you want to do if you get yourself in trouble?

111
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Since she chose to rely on men

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
She has to take the risk of not being able to rely on men

113
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is her life

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you trying to do?

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You are talking exactly like Chen Pian

116
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How can there be so many early-warners in this world?

117
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm talking about the facts

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Can we face reality?

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Can she win this lawsuit?

120
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Isn't she the one who broke it?

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Money, let's not talk about it

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Time and energy are all useless

123
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Reality is cruel

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What's the point of putting everything on the table?

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So you mean

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All the housewives should be kicked out

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because we don't work

128
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So there's no bargaining chip

129
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Are you a sensitive person?

130
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why are you so sensitive?

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Aren't we talking about others?

132
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why are you talking about yourself?

133
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I know you think you are very smart

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You are a big screenwriter

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You will make money yourself

136
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You rely on yourself

137
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We rely on men

138
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Have you ever had children?

139
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do you know how to manage such a big family?

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Will it maintain all the relationships?

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Do you know how to stand behind someone

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
To give it all for him

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And make him have no regrets

144
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you think we make money easily?

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I didn't mean that

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What do you mean then?

147
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So ugly

148
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Who makes more money?

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Who can speak loudly?

150
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You have made less money in your life

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If one day you are kicked out

152
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And the whole world says you are a psycho

153
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You deserve it

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You speak your mind

155
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I am a high-ranking Zhe Mu Si

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I admit

158
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What about you?

159
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't pretend

160
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
You have found less

161
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,000
Love in me these years

162
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes, you are lucky

163
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You are right

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We are different

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I work hard every day

166
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But Chen Kai Xi

167
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You have to admit it

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can't be a good seller

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if you are rich

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You are wearing expensive clothes

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't go the hard way

172
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You have chosen

173
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your own way

174
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No one forces you

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Stop pretending

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You are the most honest person in the world

177
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You like to be an independent woman

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You are not a woman

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Do you want to be me?

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't find that person

181
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are really a woman

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are a woman

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You are so soft

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And you are always so beautiful

185
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Where are you going?

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Stop acting

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You should take care of yourself

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You are a woman

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You should be loved

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why?

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Who are you?

192
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You are so cold

193
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You are so cold

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You should find a man

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You should find a man

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You are so cold

197
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't do anything

198
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I can find a man

199
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You envy me

200
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Envy?

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Why not?

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I envy you

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I wish you

204
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Can find a man forever

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Who knows?

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Right?

207
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't find a man

208
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You envy me

209
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Envy?

210
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't find a man

211
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You envy me

212
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Envy?

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't find a man

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You envy me

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Envy?

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I can't find a man

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You envy me

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Envy?

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I can't find a man

220
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You envy me

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Envy?

222
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't find a man

223
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You envy me

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Envy?

225
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can't find a man

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You envy me

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Envy?

228
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I can't find a man

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You envy me

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Envy?

231
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I can't find a man

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You envy me

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Envy?

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I can't find a man

235
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't find a man

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Hello

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sister

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We have an appointment tomorrow

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The landlord has an emergency

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Can we do it now?

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, the landlord has an emergency

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He has a business trip

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's do it today

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Or it will be next month

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Well

247
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Send me the address

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sister, please come in

249
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I go to make tea

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Look.

251
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
On the right side of the entrance is a kitchen.

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's about two square meters.

253
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If you go forward, there are two bedrooms.

254
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The left is the master bedroom. The right is the second bedroom.

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In the middle is the bathroom. It also has windows.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Sister, come and take a look here.

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The layout of this room is very good.

258
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And the style is good.

259
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The budget is within your scope.

260
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This house is very good.

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If the landlord is not waiting to change the big house,

262
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I can't bear to sell this house.

263
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sister, I'll go and answer the phone first.

264
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You sit here first.

265
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The house is very good.

266
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Mom, what will your future home be like?

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There must be a huge house.

268
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's an antique house for European houses.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And there must be a big window.

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's a big sea outside.

271
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What about you?

272
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The house doesn't have to be very big.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What matters is a comfortable kitchen.

274
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
People can see upstairs from the outside.

275
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So every day when I cook dinner in the kitchen,

276
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can see it when I go home.

277
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Chen Kaixi, happy wedding!

278
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Happy wedding!

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Come on, come on.

280
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't get too excited.

281
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's okay.

282
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Mom, I'm really, really grateful.

283
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If it weren't for you,

284
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Chen Kaixi and I wouldn't have been able to get married.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If it weren't for you,

286
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Chen Kaixi and I wouldn't have been able to get married.

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Luo Man,

288
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll toast to you.

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
To you,

290
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
a wave of fortune,

291
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and a simple wedding.

292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Brother, I'm warning you.

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If you do anything to Xi Xi,

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll kill you with a knife.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Did you hear that?

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Try it.

297
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I know, I know.

298
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Luo Man,

299
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
if I'm sorry for Chen Kaixi,

300
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll...

301
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll...

302
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll break my own heart.

303
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you talking about?

304
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What are you talking about?

305
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Be happy.

306
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I will.

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
My dear lady,

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I finally married you.

309
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Thank you, Luo Man.

310
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Be happy.

311
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I will.

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The End

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Are they...

314
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll ask them later.

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll ask them later.

316
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're playing well.

317
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're free to play.

318
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's play a round of price.

319
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know how to play?

320
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm good at it.

321
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What are you laughing at?

322
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm laughing at you rich people.

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're using K to type messages.

324
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you recognize me?

325
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Your girlfriend is still filming.

326
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
She's still out there.

327
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's not my girlfriend.

328
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We're just...

329
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A couple.

330
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're interesting.

331
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What's your name?

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You don't need to know my name.

333
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I can explain to you.

334
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Hello, ladies.

336
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I've finished my work.

337
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I need to find a time to make an appointment.

338
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Sister Man,

339
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
the script has been given for almost 10 days.

340
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The script is not giving any feedback.

341
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Then you can talk to Zhe Bian and Ning in the group.

342
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Remind them.

343
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay.

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Wait a minute.

345
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Baby, talk to daddy.

346
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Daddy, my brother is very good.

347
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Really?

348
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You have to be good all the time.

349
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Great.

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Honey, are you free tomorrow?

351
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes.

352
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I want Zhang Fen and the others to have dinner.

353
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You guys?

354
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Give me a list.

355
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
How about the outsiders?

356
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's troublesome to stay at home.

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
It's not troublesome.

358
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's better to eat out than to stay at home.

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Honey, don't worry.

360
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This salt is a little less.

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay.

362
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Don't worry.

363
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Thank you.

364
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Come on.

365
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's watch the surprise again.

366
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Thank you.

367
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Drink a little.

368
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Drink a little.

369
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Drink a little.

370
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Xiao Bai, drink a little.

371
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You drink a lot today.

372
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Of course.

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Go to the restaurant first.

374
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Come on.

375
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Come on.

376
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Come on.

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Happy?

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
How about my wine?

379
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Wen Wen.

380
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Go to sleep.

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The director is asleep.

382
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Let Lao He drink again.

383
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll let Si Yi send you back.

384
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Lao He, please watch my face.

385
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Let him drink less.

386
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay.

387
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't worry.

388
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Lao He.

389
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Xiao Bai.

390
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The three of us

391
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
have been fighting with our fists

392
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and fighting with our fists since we were poor.

393
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I can only say one thing.

394
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
From now on,

395
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
as long as I have a bite to eat,

396
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I will definitely not be able to kill you two.

397
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We can both be able to trade for trouble

398
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and be able to recover.

399
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I won't say anything.

400
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Let's drink.

401
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Let's drink.

402
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Cheers.

403
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Come on.

404
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Come on.

405
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Honey, cheers.

406
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Cheers.

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You two talk first.

408
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay.

409
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Sister-in-law,

410
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
you've worked hard today.

411
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm happy.

412
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Let me give you a toast.

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Come on.

414
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm also very happy today.

415
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Look at us.

416
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We were a few stupid kids.

417
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We didn't have any taste.

418
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Who would dare to think that we would have today?

419
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know about Chen Mian.

420
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He has a little bit of a temper.

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And he has his own thoughts about a lot of things.

422
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's really not easy for you to work with him

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
for so many years.

424
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Then you must know Brother Mian the best.

425
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But sister-in-law,

426
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
there is one thing you may not know.

427
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This time,

428
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
we founders have to sign a marriage contract.

429
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's the same thing that happened with the potatoes.

430
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The couple divorced and the equity changed.

431
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm not afraid of you laughing.

432
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But signing this thing,

433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you have to think about it before you sign it.

434
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You don't dare to sign this.

435
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But only your Chen Mian

436
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
will sign it without saying a word.

437
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I've been watching you two

438
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
do your best for so many years.

439
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
To be honest,

440
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I really think Brother Mian wants to live with you.

441
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Honey, why are you outside?

443
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's cold outside. Let's go back.

444
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What's wrong, honey?

445
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Honey, I'm happy.

446
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm happy for you.

447
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You did it.

448
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Honey, I believe in you.

449
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No matter if others believe it or not,

450
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I believe in you.

451
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You will definitely do it.

452
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You've been working so hard.

453
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You never give up.

454
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I always believe you can do it.

455
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Honey, your dream is coming true.

456
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm so happy for you.

457
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm so happy for you.

458
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm so happy for you.

459
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm so happy for you.

460
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm so happy for you.

461
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm so happy for you.

462
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm so happy for you.

463
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm so happy for you.

464
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm so happy for you.

465
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm so happy for you.

466
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm so happy for you.

467
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm so happy for you.

468
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm so happy for you.

469
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm so happy for you.

470
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm so happy for you.

471
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm so happy for you.

472
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm so happy for you.

473
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm so happy for you.

474
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm so happy for you.

475
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm so happy for you.

476
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm so happy for you.

477
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm so happy for you.

478
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm so stupid.

479
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
My old friend loves you so much.

480
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We sold our house to have a family then.

481
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But a girl can't be as stupid as you are.

482
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm so happy for you.

483
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't love you.

484
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay, don't cry.

485
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Crying won't make you beautiful.

486
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We'll be good friends from now on.

487
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I understand.

488
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You have to be good.

489
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Honey.

490
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I won't hurt you again.

491
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
This is the new one.

493
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's a little bit out of budget.

494
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Let's have a look first.

495
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We have to make sure the house is in good condition.

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Otherwise, it will affect the delivery.

497
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Dad, why are you so superstitious?

498
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
This house is well-known for its style and taste.

499
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So the lighting and ventilation are very good.

500
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Uncle, let me show you the bedroom.

501
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
One master bedroom, one second bedroom.

502
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
This is our master bedroom.

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
This is the second bedroom.

504
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Look, the style is very good.

505
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I like it.

506
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I like it.

507
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's a big house.

508
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's good enough for friends to come and party.

509
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This house is a very good one in the neighborhood.

510
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So it's a little bit more than the previous one.

511
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's a little bit more than the previous one.

512
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a little bit more than the previous one.

513
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's a little bit more than the previous one.

514
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But we can still talk about the price.

515
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's so expensive.

516
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
How much space do you have?

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't dare to say this, but as long as we want it,

518
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I will help us get the biggest discount.

519
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Let's take this one.

520
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
At the worst, we can bring more.

521
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Manman, are you going to put so much pressure on yourself?

522
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's okay, I can earn it.

523
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
As long as he has the ambition, it's okay.

524
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'll call the owner right now.

525
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Okay, the house is finally bought.

526
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Your mother and I have a stone in our hearts.

527
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's almost down.

528
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But we still have a big stone.

529
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Dad, why do you have so many stones in your heart?

530
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Having a house doesn't mean having a home.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's two different things.

532
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Your mother and I are very open-minded.

533
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You like literature.

534
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We don't object to this.

535
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But your marriage is already at stake.

536
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You have a house now.

537
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You can say that the choice is bigger.

538
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
People are all practical.

539
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You have a house.

540
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You have a house, and you have more confidence in finding a partner.

541
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What do you think?

542
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Dad, didn't you say that this house is my birthday gift?

543
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
What does it have to do with finding a partner?

544
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You're such a child.

545
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You're just a little smart, and you're confused about big things.

546
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Look at Chen Kaixi.

547
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
He doesn't show his face, and he doesn't show his face.

548
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You understand that.

549
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You didn't go wrong in everything.

550
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Look at you.

551
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What's wrong with me?

552
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You mean I'm not married, so I went the wrong way in life.

553
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It's just because I'm not married, right?

554
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, Xi Xi is pretty good.

555
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But before Xi Xi got married...

556
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
No.

557
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You should say that before Chen Mian got rich,

558
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
you mentioned Chen Kaixi.

559
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Shut up.

560
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You're the girl who only loves dressing up and not studying.

561
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What's wrong? Chen Mian is successful now.

562
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Xi Xi is my life's benchmark.

563
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Why are you so good at it?

564
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You finally understand the child.

565
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So people must get married.

566
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
After getting married, the two of them worked hard together.

567
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The probability of success was increased by one.

568
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Look at you.

569
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You're here alone, and you can't eat or drink.

570
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You're hungry.

571
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What's wrong?

572
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
When I mentioned marriage to you, you just dumped me.

573
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Marriage is not shameful.

574
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes, marriage is not shameful.

575
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You think I'm not married to make you feel ashamed?

576
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I...

577
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Say less.

578
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Listen, you're the one who's spoiled by her.

579
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Say less.

580
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I said, I can't.

581
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Listen, you're the one who's having trouble finding a partner.

582
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What's wrong with my personality?

583
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Listen, your mom and I bought this house for you.

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You don't appreciate it at all.

585
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You're lucky to have a star.

586
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What's wrong with your personality?

587
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
How can I be?

588
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
There's an idiom,

589
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
the duck is the best.

590
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You don't give yourself any space.

591
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Which man can stand you?

592
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I don't need a man to stand me.

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
My personality is wrong.

594
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm really inferior and narcissistic.

595
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's all because of you.

596
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know how to love.

597
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because I didn't get love.

598
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Have you ever praised me since I was a child?

599
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Have you ever loved me?

600
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I didn't get love.

601
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
How can I love?

602
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Of course I don't know how to love.

603
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Of course I don't know how to get married.

604
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Dad, who are you buying this house for?

605
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You just want to buy a house and get married.

606
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Don't you have any shame?

607
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Don't say that.

608
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
For yourself.

609
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
My personality is wrong.

610
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I don't have a man.

611
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It doesn't matter.

612
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I don't want it.

613
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What can you do to me?

614
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't want it.

615
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I bought a new computer.

616
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
No password.

617
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Can you see?

618
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Thank you.

619
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
As long as I can type.

620
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I have a computer.

621
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
When will you be in the group?

622
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
In two days.

623
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Did your family call you?

624
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's okay.

625
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You just stay here.

626
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You have a good house.

627
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Only such a house can match our Zhong Qingcheng.

628
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
How long are you in the group?

629
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Tell me, two days.

630
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Just stay in my house.

631
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

632
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't want to be late.

633
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Okay.

634
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Qingcheng.

635
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Thank you.

636
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Who is it?

637
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So noisy in the middle of the night.

638
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You have a crazy second generation.

639
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Name is Gao.

640
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
English name is Kerr.

641
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Kerr?

642
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So strange.

643
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I think all the men around me like to use the word K to hit their heads.

644
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Mr. Ken, this Kerr.

645
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And a King.

646
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Ballad.

647
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Maybe you're a K in your life.

648
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Is he the one who loves to chase female stars?

649
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The one who is famous on the Internet?

650
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
He met you and you hit the wall.

651
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Men are all the same.

652
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Either handsome or rich.

653
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
In the end, they are all talented.

654
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
In my eyes, they are all the same.

655
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You have a high level.

656
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You asked me before why I don't go to the men's party.

657
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Because of my dad.

658
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Your dad?

659
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
My dad is the kind of handsome man who has a good outlook.

660
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
When I was ten years old, he abandoned me and my mom.

661
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He ran away with his father.

662
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Anyway, from that time, I knew women had to rely on themselves.

663
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I didn't know that.

664
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I've been playing for so many years.

665
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'll leave it to him.

666
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I didn't expect you...

667
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Almost.

668
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Take a break.

669
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Do you want to eat?

670
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
No, you eat.

671
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I think you're lucky.

672
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm lucky?

673
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Yes.

674
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You have a father who loves you so much.

675
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He cares about you.

676
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He's willing to give you all the money to buy a new house.

677
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That's great.

678
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Even if you fight,

679
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
you can always have a home to go back to.

680
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Isn't that good?

681
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Sister, this fake fan is so annoying.

682
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's been so long since it was turned on.

683
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That's weird.

684
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I called yesterday and asked.

685
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
They said they were working on a new project.

686
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What they mean is that they want us to continue writing.

687
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So let's continue writing.

688
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It won't be a scam.

689
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'll be there.

690
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'll be there.

691
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Write it down.

692
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It won't be a scam.

693
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Okay.

694
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Bye.

695
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It will be different.

696
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And Jobsa Suiefsramaraj公

697
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That's weird.

698
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm not that stupid.

699
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You're so cool.

700
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's so different to have a big script.

701
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You can't write too much.

702
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You have to be very precise.

703
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
When you're trying to make sense,

704
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
you have to be logical and put the picture on the screen.

705
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
We have a timeline.

706
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Our netizens are not stupid.

707
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But

708
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
after you say these,

709
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
you have to tell your real feelings.

710
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
For example,

711
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
it's not your fault that you're pretty.

712
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Don't be so mean.

713
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And women can't hurt each other for men.

714
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Please tell the truth.

715
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
This is not a love defense.

716
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
This is insult.

717
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It's

718
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
logical and truth.

719
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You have to be sincere.

720
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Okay.

721
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Write down the words.

722
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Thank you.

723
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,160

will

727
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,640
we

728
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,380
as

729
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,580
Remember to repay me.

730
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,780
I know.

731
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,980
But you're also excellent.

732
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,140
You're pretty,

733
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,460
good at acting,

734
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,580
and hard-working.

735
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,340
You're also a good person.

736
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,420
Who's going to be angry if you don't?

737
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,220
You know what?

738
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,780
A few directors just asked me about you.

739
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,420
Really?

740
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,020
Really?

741
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,860
I'm telling you.

742
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,020
As long as you give me a chance,

743
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,980
as long as you give me a good role,

744
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,020
I can definitely do it.

745
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,380
I know.

746
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,500
Let me ask you.

747
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,300
If you really get angry,

748
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,620
what's your ultimate dream?

749
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,340
I want to act in your play.

750
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,460
You're kidding, right?

751
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,420
I'm serious.

752
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,300
I'm telling you the truth.

753
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,380
I really think so.

754
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,140
I really want to act in your play.

755
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,980
The script you wrote

756
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,580
is for a big director to shoot,

757
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,660
and I'll act.

758
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,300
Good taste.

759
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,580
Look at the netizens.

760
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,580
It's so funny.

761
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,500
What's wrong?

762
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,900
Did you have a fight with Kai Qi?

763
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,740
Is it that obvious?

764
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,300
Don't mention it.

765
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,020
As long as I have a fight,

766
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,580
I'll fight and I'll be here.

767
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,060
I can't lose.

768
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,380
I can say anything.

769
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,060
Really.

770
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,540
I'm a little confused now.

771
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,660
I don't know what to do.

772
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,060
I'm quite envious of your friendship.

773
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,620
I've never had any female friends

774
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,420
since I was a kid.

775
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,500
Is it because you're too pretty?

776
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,980
I'll be isolated

777
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,020
wherever I go.

778
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,100
It's different after I met you two.

779
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,940
You two have known each other for so long.

780
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,260
Even if you're noisy,

781
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,980
you can still be together.

782
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,900
Such a good friend is really rare.

783
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,580
But now,

784
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,420
I'm a little embarrassed

785
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,900
to say those words.

786
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,180
I can't get back to you now.

787
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,540
It's because I care about you.

788
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,780
Give me some time.

789
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,780
Can you?

790
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,260
I can't help it.

791
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,580
You're back.

792
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,180
Mom.

793
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,580
Mom.

794
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,220
Is dad still mad at me?

795
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,740
Your dad is sick.

796
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,580
Before we came here,

797
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,380
we did a physical examination in the hometown.

798
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,140
Yesterday, the results came out

799
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,420
that he had a very serious condition.

800
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,380
I asked someone to ask him

801
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,860
if he was okay

802
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,940
because he entrusted me with love.

803
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:32,020
Life will always come to an end

804
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:38,020
Whether you will or not

805
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:44,020
Thank you for doing everything

806
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,020
Let yourself be the one

807
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:56,020
With this life from old to new

808
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:06,020
How do you think of me?

809
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,020
Thank you for watching!
