1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
You're all set to test it.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,520
I hope that gives you something to check out-

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,800
The new new Kinkashi Magi is coming and bon theatre!

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,920
Go for the Kinkashi Magi series 4-9-18-99!

00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,360
Alright people.

9
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,360
What are you doing today?

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Wife, get me a shirt.

11
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Thank you.

13
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,360
This...this shirt is wrong.

14
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,360
So why did you do that?

15
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

16
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Oh.

17
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
What do you mean?

18
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
What do you mean?

19
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Are you afraid that someone's out there?

20
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I thought you didn't care.

21
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Who is that?

22
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Who is that?

23
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Did you think he was going to divorce me?

24
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,360
If you're curious, you can find someone to take pictures of me.

25
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
From now on, don't call me Wife.

27
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Do you think I look too much like Yan Qing?

28
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Do you think we should be the one who's going to give her back to us?

29
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm not going to be childish.

30
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm not kidding.

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm not kidding.

32
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm not kidding.

33
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm just kidding.

34
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm not kidding.

35
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
I'm not kidding.

36
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I'm not kidding.

37
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm not kidding.

38
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm just kidding.

39
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Do you think we should be the one who's going to give her back to us?

40
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
My marriage is like this today.

41
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I will definitely learn from it.

42
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Sometimes I think about it.

43
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I worry about myself.

44
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Am I too independent?

45
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I put all my time and effort into the marriage

46
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
to make it look like this.

47
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
You...

48
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
You're sick.

49
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Why are you so upset?

50
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Do you think Chen Min will be upset with herself now?

51
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
You've done enough.

52
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
You...

53
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
You're so upset.

54
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
But you're right.

55
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,360
You should put all your energy into your own life.

56
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
No one is more important than you.

57
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
You're afraid of nothing.

59
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I'm blind.

60
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I thought you were the honestest.

61
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
You're not even a stranger.

62
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
I'm your brother.

63
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
But you're wrong.

65
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
I'm sorry.

66
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Hello?

67
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
I heard about it.

68
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,360
You're quite smart.

69
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
I'm the one who went to the hospital.

70
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
You're quite good.

71
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
You're very considerate.

72
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Let's go now.

73
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,360
I wish you all the best.

74
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Take good care of yourself.

75
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm sorry.

77
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
I'm sorry.

78
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
You're so tired.

79
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
You're still so tired.

80
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
You should take care of yourself.

81
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,360
You're the one who's been doing this.

82
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Welcome.

83
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Here.

84
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Thank you.

85
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Is anyone here?

86
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Qiao.

87
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Qiao.

88
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
I heard that Mr. Zhou has been making trouble with his clients.

89
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I'm sorry.

90
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm old.

91
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
I should save some money.

92
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
That's true.

93
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
You know me very well.

94
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Of course.

95
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
You're a man of style.

96
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
I can't understand you.

97
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
What?

98
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
You're like a man in a restaurant now.

99
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
That's impossible.

100
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
There was only a set of meals here.

101
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Now we can have a meal alone.

102
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
To be exact,

103
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
we changed the rules of evil forces.

104
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Like our father.

105
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
I've never cooked for you.

106
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
A little bit more.

107
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
I've been writing well.

108
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I'm getting better at acting.

109
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I learned it from you.

110
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
You're a master at drawing.

111
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
What did you say?

112
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm a master at drawing.

113
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
You're so familiar with it.

114
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Actually,

115
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I can guess

116
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
the reaction you had.

117
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
You wouldn't have made a mistake.

118
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
You guessed it right.

119
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Money is gone.

120
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Money is gone!

121
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Why don't you keep an eye on it?

122
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Hey!

123
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Hey!

124
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Hey!

125
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Hey!

126
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Hey!

127
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Hey!

128
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Hey!

129
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Hey!

130
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Hey!

131
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
Hey!

132
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Hey!

133
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Hey!

134
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Hey!

135
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Hey!

136
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Hey!

137
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Actually, I did feel something.

138
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
But...

139
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,360
I just think you seem to be

140
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
not good-natured today.

141
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Maybe you're too good-natured.

142
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,360
You make me feel a little uncomfortable.

143
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
What's this?

144
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm sorry.

146
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I'm sorry.

148
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm sorry.

149
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
I'm sorry.

150
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm sorry.

151
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
I'm sorry.

152
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
I'm sorry.

153
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Mr. Zhou is still so

154
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
sweet and straightforward.

155
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I didn't lie to you.

156
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm telling the truth.

157
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
I know.

158
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,360
It's because I know it's a lie.

159
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
So...

160
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
I'm scared.

161
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm a little sad.

162
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I'll tell you the truth.

163
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I know you really like me.

164
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
And you even love me.

165
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Although I'm not that much,

166
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
but I'm a little bit better.

167
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Right?

168
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,360
But I'm sure that love

169
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,360
is very difficult for Mr. Zhou.

170
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
What do you think?

171
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Even if you're so kind and kind,

172
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
you can still use it

173
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
and calculate it.

174
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Finally, you can calculate yourself.

175
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,360
That game looks like

176
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Chen Min and Chen Kai Xi.

177
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,360
But it's actually us.

178
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Right?

179
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
But I don't want to hurt you.

180
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm afraid that

181
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,360
you'll help Chen Kai Xi win Chen Min.

182
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
What's the point?

183
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Why is there no point in doing so?

184
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
This is a problem for you.

185
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
You said before that

186
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,360
I'm a kind person to you.

187
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
I had a desire to climb up the mountain

188
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,360
with my life.

189
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I think it's true.

190
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
It's true.

191
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,360
But then I realized that we're not human.

192
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
We're not a kind person.

193
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
You're much more important to yourself than me.

194
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
It's hard to say.

195
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
You're much more selfish than me.

196
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Because when I make a lot of decisions,

197
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I don't make any decisions.

198
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
I just make one decision that I'm in pain.

199
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Is that okay?

200
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,360
You're the same as Chen Min.

201
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,360
You're the same selfish, cold and cruel.

202
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
What do you say?

203
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Because you know what you're doing, you're cruel.

204
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Here.

205
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I actually feel a little bit heartbroken.

206
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Because I think you're pitiful.

207
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
The way you climbed up

208
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
is to destroy your self-esteem.

209
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
I was thinking,

210
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
how can I ask someone

211
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
who has never been loved

212
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
by anyone seriously

213
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,360
and learned how to love someone else?

214
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,360
I think I'm a bit hard-working.

215
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm not good at it.

216
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,360
So your self-esteem is pitiful.

217
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
You should be quite lonely.

218
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Your father is like a maze.

219
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Open the door, there's still something.

220
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Open the door again, there's still something.

221
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
There's so much.

222
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
It's so hard to open.

223
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
People will think that

224
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
the last door is open.

225
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,360
There must be something in this house.

226
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
But when I opened the last door,

227
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,360
I found out when I entered that room,

228
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
there was nothing inside.

229
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Is it that hard?

230
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Yes, it is.

231
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
It's the same for me.

232
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
What about Fang Chi?

233
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Isn't he like this?

234
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Or is he just not

235
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
as capable as we are?

236
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,360
You're so ugly now, Mr. Zhong.

237
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Tomorrow at 6 p.m.,

238
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
the public banquet will be held.

239
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
The media meeting will be held in the record store.

240
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Please gather at 5 p.m.

241
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
and come to the venue.

242
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
There's a public banquet tonight.

243
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
You can't miss any of them.

244
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Okay, thank you.

245
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Thank you so much for this.

246
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
We're in the hospital.

247
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Sir.

248
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Boss.

249
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Congratulations.

250
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm giving the director a job.

251
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Hello, director.

252
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Long Man.

253
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Long Man.

254
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Sun.

255
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Hello.

256
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Help me wash it.

257
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
I'm in so far.

258
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Hello.

259
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
We're all ready to enter the venue.

260
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Go ahead.

261
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
In these months,

262
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,360
we all worked together.

263
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,360
And we've experienced many unforgettable moments.

264
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,360
I'd like to say something to you.

265
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Everyone, thank you.

266
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Thank you for your hard work.

267
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,360
The core of the record store is a true self.

268
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
We want to capture the truth.

269
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
To express the truth.

270
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
So,

271
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
I've been asking myself.

272
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,360
I've been asking our team.

273
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
So, today,

274
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,360
I'd like to give this opportunity to all the medical workers.

275
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,360
To express our highest respect.

276
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Thank you.

277
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Thank you.

278
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Thank you.

279
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
What's this?

280
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
It's so sweet.

281
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
This is good.

282
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
This is the way.

283
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,360
Who's that woman?

284
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Who?

285
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Don't touch me.

286
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
It's not me.

287
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Just a minute.

288
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Then who's Fang Chi?

289
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Who's Fang Chi?

290
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
It's so mysterious.

291
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Come on. Let's all wish our team

292
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
a high-end victory.

293
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Yes.

294
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Hello, I'm Liu Ben.

295
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
This guest is amazing.

296
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
She's the first foodie to be welcomed.

297
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
She's the current famous guest,

298
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
the guest of the guest house,

299
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Miss Chen Kai Xi.

300
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Welcome.

301
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Hello, I'm Chen Kai Xi.

302
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Hello, I'm happy to have you here.

303
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
What kind of food would you like to share with us?

304
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
Today, we're bringing...

305
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Welcome, Miss Chen Kai Xi.

306
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I've read your script.

307
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Miss Xi is so busy.

308
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,360
She can read my script from the beginning.

309
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
What's that?

310
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
You're making me feel proud.

311
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Art?

312
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Art is about life.

313
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Life is about money.

314
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
And the background, the story,

315
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
everything is different.

316
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Who can know it's you?

317
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
I know.

318
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
So, I'm like this in your heart.

319
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Three years.

320
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Kai Xi, you didn't finish reading.

321
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
She's so amazing.

322
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
I'm so curious.

323
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Why did we start this?

324
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,360
It's because we started this years ago.

325
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
I'll go with you.

326
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
Really?

327
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
Can we?

328
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Can we be so friendly?

329
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
We're going.

330
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
There must be a lot of people.

331
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm going, too.

332
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
Aren't you afraid that others will know

333
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
you're a character?

334
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
You said you can't recognize me.

335
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Yes.

336
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
But I can say it at the end.

337
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Thank you, Miss Chen Kai Xi,

338
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
for making this script.

339
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
I'm okay.

340
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm free to promote it.

341
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Can we do a show?

342
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
You're...

343
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
You're the president.

344
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
You're so realistic.

345
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
I like it.

346
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Happy New Year.

347
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Happy New Year.

348
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
How many generations do you have?

349
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
I can't see you anywhere.

350
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm a team member now.

351
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Give me some strength.

352
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Give me more.

353
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
It's not good.

354
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,360
So you have to be smart.

355
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
You have the strength to make sense.

356
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
The brand is following you.

357
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
That's right.

358
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Strength is important.

359
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
By the way, Xin Chen.

360
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
I still want to thank you.

361
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
If you didn't bring me the idea,

362
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I wouldn't have broken the line so soon.

363
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
You still want to take these?

364
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
You still want to take these?

365
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I didn't want to say that.

366
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Speaking of the idea,

367
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Xi Xi.

368
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
You're the one who's been practicing.

369
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
You're thinking about it.

370
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Really.

371
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
There's no regret in your efforts.

372
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
You should go.

373
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,360
First, everyone knows your brand.

374
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
Fourth,

375
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,360
I also want to see Xi Xi

376
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
in the TV show

377
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
and talk to those handsome boys

378
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,360
and talk to them about love.

379
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Let them learn.

380
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
That's great.

381
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Forget it.

382
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
You're still young.

383
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Let's wait for him to say it.

384
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Tiao Tiao,

385
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
are you back in Shanghai?

386
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
His father took him away.

387
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
His grandfather and grandmother are here.

388
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
It's your turn.

389
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Hello, Mr. Pei Pei.

390
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,360
I want to lose my equity.

391
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Then,

392
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
what do you want?

393
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
Just...

394
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
I'll take my time.

395
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Enjoy your meal.

396
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Here you go.

397
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
You're still so strong.

398
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
You're too strong

399
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
in the cold restaurant.

400
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
It's hot.

401
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
But I'll say it again.

402
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
I lost my equity this year.

403
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
I lost it.

404
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
You...

405
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
You're a king.

406
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Why are you running?

407
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
There are so many girls in the company.

408
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
They're all so handsome.

409
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
They don't even look at me.

410
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Or do you

411
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
have a heart

412
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,360
that doesn't want to be a hero?

413
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Don't talk about me.

414
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Do you think I don't know why you're running?

415
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
It's because that girl

416
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
put you through it.

417
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
She's the chairman of the company.

418
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
She's a very good worker.

419
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
She's a very good worker.

420
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,360
The real estate is all in the past.

421
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,360
I didn't realize that I've known you for so many years.

422
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Why are you so bad-tempered?

423
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Did you learn from Luo Man?

424
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm glad you two are good.

425
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
You said before,

426
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
I was the one who made the girl.

427
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Now you're making me the girl.

428
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
I'm so upset.

429
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Do you know why?

430
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
What's wrong with me?

431
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Girls know

432
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
how much they love their men.

433
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
What a bastard.

434
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
But men

435
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
are like girls

436
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
who have been

437
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,360
in the same bed for more than ten years.

438
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
You don't even know her identity.

439
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Am I

440
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
stupid?

441
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Yes.

442
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Me too.

443
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm a little bit better than you.

444
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
I...

445
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,360
I've never underestimated any woman.

446
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
I'm so happy.

447
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
I miss her.

448
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm sorry.

449
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
What's wrong?

450
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
I might have been blind.

451
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
What are you looking at?

452
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Are you really blind?

453
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
I'm an old man.

454
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
How do I feel that we're so special?

455
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
You can get rid of your feeling.

456
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Drink.

457
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Isn't this our way of eating?

458
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
There are so many fans in Fang Chi.

459
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
They send us a Weibo

460
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
and we get thousands of comments.

461
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Really?

462
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
There are so many people who are in the same group.

463
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
Just you and me.

464
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
That's the thing.

465
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Baby.

466
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
What's your relationship with Fang Chi?

467
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
It's like

468
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
when you're very tired,

469
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
you want to meet someone.

470
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,360
And when you meet someone,

471
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,360
you can hold on to that relationship for a while.

472
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
You can't say it too clearly.

473
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
What you're saying now

474
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,360
is exactly like what you said to Zhou Mo.

475
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Can you learn something?

476
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Of course.

477
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm just kidding.

478
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Do you have that?

479
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Yes.

480
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Do you have that?

481
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
You...

482
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
You guys are so straightforward.

483
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
What's the point?

484
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Yes.

485
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
No.

486
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
We can't talk about the spiritual world.

487
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Yes.

488
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
You're so straightforward.

489
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Hurry up.

490
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Hurry up.

491
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Don't ask.

492
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
My brain is very messy.

493
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
It's messy.

494
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
It's messy.

495
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
It's so messy.

496
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Jiang Dong is so good.

497
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
It's messy.

498
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
It's messy.

499
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Happy New Year.

500
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Happy New Year.

501
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Let's sleep.

502
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Let's sleep.

503
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Yes.

504
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Let's go.

505
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Stay strong forever.

506
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Come on.

507
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Bye.

508
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
It's the first day of the New Year.

509
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
It's not easy.

510
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
You're not leaving today, are you?

511
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Of course.

512
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
I'll sleep with you.

513
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
What are you thinking about?

514
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
I think...

515
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Fang Chi is good.

516
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Of course,

517
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
he can't compete with Zhong Mu Sun.

518
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,360
But if you still think about it,

519
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
you don't have to worry about it.

520
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I didn't compare Ya Gen with Zhong Mu Sun.

521
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
They are...

522
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
different.

523
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
What's the main reason?

524
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,360
He's too young.

525
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
He's too young.

526
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
His life is full of unknown things.

527
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,360
If I'm with him,

528
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
our relationship will be full of unknown things.

529
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
I'm so busy now.

530
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
I really don't have

531
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
too much experience

532
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,360
to share this unknown feeling.

533
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
So...

534
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Isn't he young?

535
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
He's so young.

536
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Besides,

537
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Fang Chi is young.

538
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
But he's not unreliable.

539
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Right?

540
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
What are you afraid of?

541
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm afraid...

542
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm afraid of injury.

543
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I know Fang Chi is unreliable now.

544
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
But can you be sure that

545
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,360
he will be like this in the future?

546
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Will he be the first, second Zhong Mu Sun?

547
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Or the second Chen Mian?

548
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Right?

549
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
But you're right.

550
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm afraid.

551
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
I'm relieved.

552
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
After I've experienced that kind of love,

553
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,360
I don't believe

554
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,360
in the fact that I'm human.

555
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I don't believe in love.

556
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
What I'm saying is that

557
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
I'm a little helpless.

558
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
You're saying that

559
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
because I'm with Chen Mian?

560
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,360
Why are you so sensitive again?

561
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
I...

562
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm not sensitive.

563
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
I'm just...

564
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
He Bei.

565
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
You know what?

566
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
The only thing that

567
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
doesn't change is that

568
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,360
he will keep changing.

569
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,360
People will change.

570
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
You will change.

571
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
He will change.

572
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Everyone will change.

573
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I know that.

574
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
It's bad that

575
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
you don't change.

576
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
You know what?

577
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Chen Mian came to pick me up yesterday.

578
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
We even talked about work.

579
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
We talked for half an hour.

580
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,360
The process of talking was very fun.

581
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,360
I didn't expect that.

582
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
I didn't expect

583
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
that Chen Mian wouldn't like me.

584
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
I didn't expect that

585
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
I still feel that Chen Mian is not easy.

586
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
You won't have any right.

587
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
We are now

588
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
the parents of Tiao Tiao and mom.

589
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
No matter what,

590
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
for Tiao Tiao,

591
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
I will still give her the face.

592
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,360
I really want to tell you

593
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
that I hope that you don't want to

594
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
do things that

595
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
may or may not happen

596
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
for the future.

597
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
From now on,

598
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
you may feel that I'm crazy.

599
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
If

600
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
I go back to 18

601
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
when I was 18,

602
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
I think

603
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Chen Kai Xi,

604
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
who is 18,

605
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
will still love

606
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
and enjoy the life of Tiao Tiao.

607
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
I don't regret

608
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
having a little love.

609
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
Anyway,

610
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
no matter what the future is,

611
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
I will accompany you

612
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,360
and continue to do well.

613
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
No matter what the life of the father is,

614
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
we can all accept it.

615
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Right?

616
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Tiao Tiao

617
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Come here.

618
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
I'll go to the toilet.

619
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Okay.

620
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Tiao Tiao

621
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
Tiao Tiao

622
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
Boss, you can go out.

623
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
Who is this group?

624
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360
I think it's Luo Man.

625
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Is it you, Luo Man?

626
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,360
You must be careful.

627
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Who is this?

628
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
I don't want to make you misunderstand.

629
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I don't want to give you

630
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
any unnecessary trouble.

631
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Everyone said that there is light in my eyes.

632
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Probably because

633
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm looking at the person behind the camera.

634
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
What is he thinking?

635
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Hello, what's up?

636
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Tian, is that you?

637
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
The internet is all broken.

638
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
What, what me?

639
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Don't deny it.

640
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
Don't be so silly.

641
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
I'm not so silly.

642
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
We bought these clothes together.

643
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
You are so cute.

644
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Don't be angry.

645
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Wait for me in the hospital.

646
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
I'll sue you.

647
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,360
Happy New Year.

648
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Congratulations.

649
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Happy New Year.

650
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
Brother.

651
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Brother.

652
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Chen Gansi's wedding.

653
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,360
Is your belt

654
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
mine?

655
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Yes.

656
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,360
You remember it.

657
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,360
I remember it.

658
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Mom, what are you looking at?

659
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
This, look.

660
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
I really...

661
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,360
I really...

662
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,360
I really...

663
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,360
Here, take a look.

664
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Come on, take a look.

665
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,360
One, two, three.

666
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
Let's go.

667
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,360
This kick is really great.

668
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
Mom, here's the wedding.

669
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,360
Good.

670
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Let's go.

671
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,360
I can't take it anymore.

672
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,360
Okay.

673
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
I'll go in first.

674
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Then you can take a photo here.

675
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
Okay, again,

676
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
applause.

677
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Congratulations to all of you.

678
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
The award-winning students.

679
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
All of you,

680
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
you can take a break.

681
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Mr. Luo Man, please stay.

682
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,360
Next is our production part of the work.

683
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,360
First, we invite our editor, Luo Man.

684
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,360
His work is the enemy of love.

685
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,360
It is the only work that gets a lot of votes in this election.

686
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,360
His work is not only a story of a wonderful person,

687
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:05,360
but also a real woman's life and real feelings.

688
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,360
Next, we invite Mr. Luo Man

689
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
to produce his work for everyone.

690
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
Thank you.

691
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Zhang Ailin once said,

692
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
all women are equal.

693
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,360
This means that

694
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,360
the competition between women is important.

695
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,360
But I think

696
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,360
on this outside,

697
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,360
on this top,

698
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,360
all women are equal.

699
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
The relationship between women and women

700
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,360
can be complicated,

701
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
changed,

702
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,360
deep.

703
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,360
They can be enemies,

704
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,360
they can be lovers,

705
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,360
they can also be enemies and lovers.

706
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,360
My story

707
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,360
is to talk about a group of women like this.

708
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,360
After they understand each other's respect,

709
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,360
they can give themselves to each other,

710
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,360
to each other.

711
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,360
Of course, I also have a little bit of a personal opinion.

712
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,360
I want to take this story

713
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,360
to thank these lovely women in my life.

714
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Thank you.

715
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,360
When I was young, I was beautiful.

716
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,360
I wanted to face myself.

717
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,360
I was able to be reborn.

718
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,360
I saw the moon.

719
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,360
The sky was bright.

720
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,360
I wanted to see the big, long,

721
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,360
long,

722
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
endless.

723
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:51,360
I want to learn to be a little bit more.

724
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

725
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

726
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

727
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

728
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

729
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

730
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

731
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

732
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.

733
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,360
The world is black, but it doesn't matter.
