00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,760
As the music transfers, the shortives have all mily

Oh

5
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Oh

6
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Yeah

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,520
Then you tell me what is called true

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,760
You

9
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Xin Lin bai

10
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
Began

11
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
adopted

12
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,780
Suiic

13
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,700
what for me to learn the you choose another

14
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,540
Who never tell?

15
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,540
I really like you like this.

16
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,540
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,540
Where are you going? I'll ask Mr. Liu to send you.

18
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,540
No need. I've already called a cab.

19
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,540
The work is the work, the private is the private. The company needs to be clear.

20
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,540
I've already put everything that Mr. Zhou said in my heart.

21
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,540
So that you won't be able to explain yourself when you meet someone.

22
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
I'm leaving.

23
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
I'm leaving.

24
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Sister Kai Qi, you're so beautiful.

25
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
You're so beautiful.

26
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm not. I haven't been able to hold hands for years.

27
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,540
I'm not afraid of being in front of so many people.

28
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,540
I remember that year, the first time Chen Mian went to the big event,

29
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,540
I bought him a new coat.

30
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,540
I went to dinner with him. He really didn't want to show off.

31
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,540
I told the waiter to help me hang up this famous coat.

32
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,540
Oh my god. I can't even lift my head up.

33
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,540
Just the two of us, we're really just...

34
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
...a bunch of jackasses.

35
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,540
We've been through hard times, but we've also been through good times.

36
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:44,540
I just don't know why we don't have a common topic right now.

37
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,540
So I want to do something for myself.

38
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,540
I want to start a business.

39
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
I want to start a business.

40
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,540
I remember when Chen Mian started his business,

41
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,540
he was still in school.

42
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Did his family object?

43
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,540
Every single student in the Chen family is different.

44
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
The whole family is different.

45
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,540
When he started his business, I was also his support.

46
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,540
It's hard, but I think it's okay.

47
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
Chen Mian wanted to start a business.

48
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,540
He got all the support from his family.

49
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
His girlfriend understood him.

50
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,540
We're different.

51
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,540
I remember when I was in Beijing, I secretly walked away.

52
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,540
My parents were so angry.

53
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,540
They said,

54
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,540
since you did this, we've never been happy.

55
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
They still say that now.

56
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,540
So I have to say,

57
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,540
I really envy Chen Mian.

58
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Baby, think about it.

59
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,540
If I want to start a business today, what can I do?

60
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
There are two ways.

61
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
The first is to save the country.

62
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,540
You can find Chen Mian to invest in a big online store.

63
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,540
But it's not worth it.

64
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
You don't have to be willing.

65
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,540
The second way is to use your time and energy to buy resources.

66
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,540
But you have to think about it.

67
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
You may not be able to afford your family.

68
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,540
Would you like to?

69
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,540
No.

70
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Why don't you try to start a brand?

71
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
I see many wives have small jewelry stores.

72
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
It's a high-profile business.

73
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Yes, it's a high-profile business.

74
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,540
Okay.

75
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Don't think about anything else.

76
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,540
Just stay at home and be a good wife.

77
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,540
Tiao Tiao, what are we going to do with the yellow croaker today?

79
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,540
We'll make yellow croaker cake.

80
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
It's very simple.

81
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,540
Wash the yellow croaker and dry it.

82
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,540
Slice it on both sides and fry until golden brown on both sides.

83
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,540
Then put the pork belly in another pan.

84
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
Add green onion, ginger and garlic after the oil is out.

85
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,540
Then put the fried yellow croaker in.

86
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
Add cooking wine and broth.

87
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Then put the cut and seasoned rice cake in.

88
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
When the rice cake is cooked, it's ready to go.

89
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Okay.

90
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Wow.

91
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Wow.

92
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
What?

93
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,540
That's amazing.

94
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
It's very simple.

95
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Very simple?

96
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
How is it simple?

97
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,540
You know it after you've done it once.

98
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
How about this?

99
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,540
You can make a short video and be a food blogger.

100
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
That's great.

101
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,540
And Uncle Chen is a chef.

102
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
You can make a lot of food.

103
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
That's...

104
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Right?

105
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,540
I think it's pretty good, Sister Kai.

106
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
I've seen it before.

107
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
It's pretty good.

108
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Really?

109
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,540
What's my selling point?

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Your life is your selling point.

111
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
You think everyone can have this life?

112
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Right?

113
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,540
And this recipe...

114
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,540
You don't have to be too long.

115
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,540
But you have to be long in the way you express it.

116
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,540
Like the part you just did.

117
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,540
You know?

118
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,540
And don't show your face when you're shooting.

119
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,540
But if you do,

120
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
bring it to your kitchen.

121
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
Low-key show.

122
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
Secretly shooting.

123
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
It will arouse the curiosity of the netizens.

124
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
Everyone can eat this.

125
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
I love watching movies.

126
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,540
What?

127
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
What's the specific topic?

128
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,540
First, we need a cheap and useful photographer.

129
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,540
He has to pack everything in the early and late stages.

130
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
He has to have a good job.

131
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
I know a guy named Xiao Nan Ke.

132
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
He's a little arrogant.

133
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,540
He wants to go to the movies.

134
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
I brought a lot of stuff.

135
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
I can pack all the stuff in.

136
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
Okay.

137
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
A little higher.

138
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
I'll help you.

139
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Okay.

140
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Let me see.

141
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Okay.

142
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Okay.

143
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Okay.

144
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Okay.

145
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Are you ready?

146
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Let's start.

147
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Three, two, one.

148
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
Action.

149
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
When you're shooting,

150
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
don't show your face.

151
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
Just your hands.

152
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Just show your hands that are good at cooking.

153
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
A fixed position.

154
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Soft light.

155
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Music.

156
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Small words.

157
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
Ma Hong.

158
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,540
I'm so interested.

159
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
I'm so interested.

160
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:22,820
But if everyone has a problem with the

161
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,820
I don't think it's easy to solve.

162
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
There's a lot of stuff.

163
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I don't think it's easy to solve.

164
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
It can be solved in the script.

165
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,820
How long do you want to see the script?

166
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
A week in the first three episodes, okay?

167
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,820
I'll be waiting for you while the iron is hot.

168
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Okay.

169
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,820
Please.

170
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Okay.

171
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
You're annoying.

172
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Do you think I know anything?

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
exercise

174
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Do you know anything?

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Med anchor

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Don't block the approach.

177
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
After food.

178
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,820
You've equity.

179
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,820
This is the right time.

180
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:10,820
What is it

181
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
It was juice

182
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
What do you think?

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
It's interesting.

184
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Really?

185
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,820
I told you that the first episode must be the wild yellow croaker.

186
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
It looks really good.

187
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
We can make four or five of them.

188
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Honey, you know what?

189
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
If we only make food videos,

190
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
we can't make a full-fledged video.

191
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
It won't look good.

192
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
It's not bad.

193
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Have you tried it?

194
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
How do you like it?

195
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
You haven't tried it. How dare you?

196
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Just share it.

197
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
There won't be any water flowers in the beginning.

198
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Anyway, you can share it and read the comments.

199
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Honey,

200
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
how about you make the first episode?

201
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
It's meaningful.

202
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Come on.

203
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Honey,

204
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
how about this?

205
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
I'll send you the video after I finish shooting.

206
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Please give me some advice.

207
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Tell the photographer to pay more attention to the lighting.

208
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
And give more opportunities.

209
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Otherwise, it will be too monotonous.

210
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
And the most important thing is that your pace should be faster.

211
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
The audience will love the fragmented time.

212
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Honey, say it again. I'll remember it.

213
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
Tell the photographer to pay more attention to the lighting.

214
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
And give more opportunities.

215
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Are you asleep?

216
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Yes.

217
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I'm still writing the script.

218
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Come back tomorrow.

219
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
I'm going downstairs.

220
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm going to the airport.

221
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
Why are you so late?

222
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
I just got off the plane.

223
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,820
Did you write it secretly?

224
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,820
No, I didn't. Do you like it?

225
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
I can't feel the pain today.

226
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
I have to feel the pain.

227
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
What do you mean?

228
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I'm going to the airport.

229
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
Why don't you go?

230
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
I have to finish the script.

231
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
I have a lot of writing to do.

232
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
It's too much trouble for me to go to your house and make it up.

233
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
I haven't written in my house for a long time.

234
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Edie is coming tomorrow.

235
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
She will fight with me.

236
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Don't come back and bother me.

237
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Stay away from me, okay?

238
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
What's wrong? Are you tired?

239
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I'm not used to the hotel bed.

240
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
I haven't slept well for days.

241
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Are you not used to the hotel bed or not used to it?

242
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
You don't have me by your side.

243
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
You are so tired.

244
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
You should go back and rest early, okay?

245
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I want to hug you for a while.

246
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
I want to hug you for a while.

247
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Here.

248
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Baby, I'm done.

249
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Chen Ming took it and sent it to me.

250
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
He looked at it seriously.

251
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
He said I did a good job.

252
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Then he kept nagging me.

253
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
He said you should do this and that.

254
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Fortunately, he is my husband, not my boss.

255
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
Otherwise, I would be so annoyed.

256
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Isn't that good?

257
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
It means that your boss Chen cares about you.

258
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Right?

259
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
But I found that

260
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,820
all the bosses think about the best way to get the best result.

261
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
Last night, Zhou didn't even say hello to me.

262
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
He went downstairs directly.

263
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
I was in a hurry to write a script.

264
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
I had to go downstairs to meet him.

265
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Guess what?

266
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
I spent a whole night writing the script.

267
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I'm so annoyed.

268
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
I'm so annoyed.

269
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
The next day

270
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
Maybe you should pay attention to the lighting.

271
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Then change the position a few more times.

272
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
The rhythm can be faster.

273
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
The rhythm is not changing.

274
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,820
It's what I told Mr. Luo.

275
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
And I think he wants to cooperate now.

276
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
But he can't do it.

277
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
There are not many devices.

278
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Besides, it's not the same price.

279
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,820
How about we shoot according to the plan this time?

280
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
If it doesn't work, we'll change the plan next time.

281
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
The next day

282
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
There are really few cameras.

283
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
They are all of the same level.

284
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
What do you mean by few cameras?

285
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
But the language of the camera is very monotonous.

286
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
You can even fall asleep when others look at you.

287
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Many food bloggers on the Internet shoot like this.

288
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
Did you see it?

289
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Who did you see?

290
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Why do you want to learn from others?

291
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Then you shoot.

292
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Why should I shoot? I'm not a photographer.

293
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
I've never seen you.

294
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
It's okay. It's all art discussions.

295
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
We don't have to be too serious.

296
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
What's wrong?

297
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Why are you back so early?

298
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Other kids have gone to play the flyer.

299
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
He's not happy if he can't play.

300
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Baby, it's okay.

301
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
It's over when you say it.

302
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
There's no need to be unhappy.

303
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Hello, honey.

304
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,820
My mom called you. Why didn't you answer?

305
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I was shooting a video.

306
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
My phone was muted.

307
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,820
My mom just wants to help her and a few girlfriends.

308
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Book a ticket to the hotel or something.

309
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
What?

310
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
A t-shirt?

311
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Do I have to do it now?

312
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
Do I have to do it now?

313
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
Okay.

314
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,820
I'll play with you after the meeting.

315
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
I'll play with you after the meeting.

316
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
I've read the material.

317
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,820
To be honest, it's not very good.

318
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
How is it?

319
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
Mr. Luo Men,

320
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
apart from working,

321
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
what we're most afraid of is unprofessional leaders.

322
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
Who does the scene belong to?

323
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
The scene is not our profession.

324
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
It's definitely not professional.

325
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,820
But at least he knows what he wants and what he doesn't want.

326
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,820
He can express himself.

327
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
As for Zhong Qingcheng,

328
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,820
you can find some of his clips to see.

329
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Forget it.

330
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
I can't find him.

331
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
I've seen him play.

332
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Even a very small role can play a living fire.

333
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
I think sometimes,

334
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
we shouldn't just put the professional

335
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,820
or unprofessional

336
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,820
on someone else's head.

337
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
It's not up to you to decide.

338
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
What if no one watches the video?

339
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Every morning,

340
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
the women in the village

341
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
would go to the river to wash their clothes.

342
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,820
They would put their clothes on the rocks

343
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
and hit them with a wooden stick.

344
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,820
The clothes would be washed very quickly.

345
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Watching the villagers come and go,

346
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
working hard,

347
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
they would say,

348
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
I just get used to this.

349
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Watching the villagers come and go,

350
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
working hard,

351
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
these rocks feel warm in your heart.

352
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,820
I just wrote the script for Flight fluorescent and

353
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Send it to Mingxiaohao.

354
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
It'll get some fans.

355
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
How can I send it to Mingxiaohao?

356
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Mingxiaohao!

357
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
Mom, I'm here!

358
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
I see.

359
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,820
How are your hands?

360
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
They're fine.

361
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
Go find your brother.

362
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
This old woman

363
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
is really amazing.

364
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Look at her.

365
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
She's so anxious

366
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
for the wedding.

367
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,820
She's so embarrassing.

368
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
She even let Weiwei

369
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
go out alone.

370
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
I...

371
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
I'm Jiang Liwen.

372
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
A few days ago,

373
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
my aunt saw it.

374
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
She said she went out early in the morning

375
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
and took a small suitcase

376
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,820
and took a online car.

377
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,820
I didn't even send a car to send her off.

378
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Come on, slow down.

379
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
Chenchen!

380
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
Chenchen!

381
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
Chenchen!

382
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Chenchen is now

383
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
taken by my aunt.

384
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
She won't let her

385
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
see her mother.

386
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
Who do you think

387
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
the child is looking for?

388
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
I found some

389
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
people I'm interested in.

390
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
Which one do you think is suitable?

391
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,820
I don't know.

392
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,820
Hello, my baby.

393
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Hey, the scriptwriter

394
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
is finally free.

395
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
I just checked

396
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
Deng Xinye's Weibo.

397
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
It's good.

398
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,820
3 million fans.

399
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
I'll transfer it to her

400
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
and you'll get the news.

401
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
But why should she

402
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,820
send it to me?

403
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,820
It's not easy.

404
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
First,

405
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,820
send some

406
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,820
unmoving,

407
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
pale Weibo.

408
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
How?

409
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,820
Chen Kaixi, stop pretending.

410
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
You don't know how to send it.

411
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
I'll open your Weibo now.

412
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
I'll open your Weibo now.

413
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
Just search for

414
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
the word, husband.

415
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
See what I found.

416
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
I just found out that

417
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
the manager of the department store

418
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,820
is a pretty girl.

419
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,820
I'm a little upset.

420
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,820
The husband said,

421
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
I should be

422
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
the poorest of his clients.

423
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,820
Don't worry.

424
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,820
There's also a title,

425
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,820
The Men's Routine.

426
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Isn't this a script?

427
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
Show love,

428
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
anti-russian,

429
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
and all together,

430
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
sour, sweet, and annoying.

431
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
And there's another one,

432
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
which seems to be bitter,

433
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,820
but is actually anti-Russian.

434
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
This is called,

435
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
bitter and annoying.

436
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,820
Xixi, you're pretty talented.

437
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Didn't we just have money at that time?

438
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
We just like to send

439
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
those things that we don't have.

440
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
You'd better tell me specifically

441
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
what to send.

442
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Specifically?

443
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
How about this?

444
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,820
You just forward it

445
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
to the Weibo that Chen Min's company is going to launch.

446
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
And then just send a signal.

447
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Just send a signal?

448
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
This is the most advanced

449
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
and simplest problem.

450
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
And then you're not going to

451
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
comment on his Weibo.

452
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
You also remember when you comment.

453
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
It's a matter of the eye.

454
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
Point to the end.

455
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
I think this Deng Xin is also

456
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
quite experienced.

457
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
He also has a fake bottom.

458
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
And I saw what he posted on Weibo.

459
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
I think this person is quite proud.

460
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,820
He always criticizes society.

461
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
I think he won't be willing to do it.

462
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
He will.

463
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
In this respect,

464
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
you can trust me.

465
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
People who pretend like this

466
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
like to kneel down in front of capital.

467
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
Deng Xin also replied to me.

468
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
She also texted me.

469
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
I invited her to dinner at home.

470
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
You're here, right?

471
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Enjoy your meal.

472
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
Do you think

473
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
we're eating here

474
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
like I've done a great job

475
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
for the company

476
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
and you're rewarding me

477
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,820
with a meal like this?

478
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
Look at what they're wearing.

479
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
I won't reward my subordinates

480
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
with such a meal anyway.

481
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
Then

482
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,820
my subordinates like me can't do it either.

483
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,820
I just want to make sure

484
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
that I don't get any trouble.

485
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
I won't invite you to be my subordinate.

486
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,820
Why?

487
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
You're so smart.

488
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,820
Who told me

489
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,820
that a student who teaches will starve to death?

490
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
Then I'll take it as a compliment.

491
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,820
Do you know why I like you?

492
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Why?

493
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,820
Because

494
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
a smart woman like me

495
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
why are you laughing?

496
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
I'm not going to say it.

497
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
Okay, go ahead.

498
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Why?

499
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,820
Because a smart woman like me

500
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,820
from the first relationship

501
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,820
I learned one thing.

502
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,820
It's to pretend to be stupid.

503
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,820
I have to pretend to be more stupid than the other person.

504
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
How should I put it?

505
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,820
I have to pretend to be very awkward

506
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
and look at her.

507
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,820
And I have to make the other person feel that I'm looking at her.

508
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Then the other person will think that I'm cute.

509
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
It seems like

510
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,820
I can get the so-called love.

511
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Are you tired?

512
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,820
Yes.

513
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
But

514
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
I don't need to be with you.

515
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
The yellow ginseng is ready.

516
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,820
It's so delicious.

517
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,820
It's so delicious.

518
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
It's so delicious.

519
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
It's so delicious.

520
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
It's so delicious.

521
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
It's so delicious.

522
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,820
This is delicious when it's hot.

523
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
It's so delicious, Mrs. Chen.

524
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
We can't eat it anymore.

525
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
It's so hard to invite you.

526
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
I'm so happy.

527
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,820
I usually like to read your recommended books.

528
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,820
I've read several books in a row.

529
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,820
I've made a lot of money.

530
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
The taste is so good.

531
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
I'll toast to you.

532
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
I thought no one was reading now.

533
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Nowadays, people take a picture of a picture and post it on WeChat.

534
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
It's a social habit.

535
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
I just graduated from Chinese school.

536
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,820
I can't say how many books I've read.

537
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
It's just an interest.

538
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Let's eat.

539
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
It's cold.

540
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,820
Okay.

541
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,820
It's good.

542
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
Right?

543
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:43,920
In 1997, I wrote an article about the

544
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Is it so important to read and write in the future?

545
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Technology has changed everything.

546
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:03,920
So, people like you have changed the world completely.

547
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,920
For you, for technology, for the new era.

548
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Cheers.

549
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Cheers.

550
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
It's good.

551
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
Cheers.

552
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
Why do you look so accurate?

553
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,960
According to my judgment, these marketing accounts are usually

554
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
attention whore.

555
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Right.

556
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Attention whore is more accurate.

557
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:37,620
Their

558
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,620
because they think attacking these people is the safest.

559
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Ordinary people care about it occasionally.

560
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,620
But they are not good at climbing up the ladder.

561
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,620
You're really good.

562
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
I need to go to the bathroom.

563
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Don't worry.

564
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,620
I'll just go.

565
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,620
I'll go.

566
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
I'll go.

567
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,620
I'll go.

568
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,620
I'll go.

569
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
I'll go.

570
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,620
I'll go.

571
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
I'll go.

572
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,620
But they're so smart to climb up the ladder.

573
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,620
You're so good.

574
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,860
How is it?

575
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,380
I think it's been reposted

576
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,620
and you've got tens of thousands of views.

577
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
It's quite effective.

578
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,460
Miss, your full-body beauty is done.

579
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,100
Do you want to change your hair

580
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
to make up for your loss?

581
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
No need.

582
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,820
My hands are not clean.

583
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Okay.

584
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
I'll wait for you outside.

585
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Okay.

586
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Okay.

587
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
Hello, Miss.

588
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
Can you fill in the questionnaire for us?

589
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
We have a small gift for you.

590
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
Miss Yu, would you like some flower tea?

591
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Okay.

592
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
Please take a break.

593
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
Du Tian is very satisfied.

594
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
I'm sorry.

595
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Please wait a moment.

596
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
I'll go get a new pen.

597
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
Use mine first.

598
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Even a perfect woman like her can't keep her.

599
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Why should I?

600
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Use it first. It's okay.

601
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Use it first. It's okay.

602
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
Thank you.

603
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
I...

604
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
saw Yu Qiao Qiao.

605
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,140
How is she now?

606
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
She's fine.

607
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
She's fine.

608
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
She's fine.

609
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
She's fine.

610
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
She's fine.

611
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Last night,

612
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
Chen Min went home.

613
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
We chatted.

614
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Lao Zhou asked me before.

615
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
He said,

616
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,180
what kind of life do you think is a good life?

617
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,180
I said,

618
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,180
Chen Kai Qi.

619
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,180
A life like Chen Kai Qi's is a good life.

620
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,180
Do you think

621
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
I'm living a good life?

622
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,180
Honey,

623
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,180
we've decided on the English tutor.

624
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,700
He's a third-year student.

625
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,700
He has a very good accent.

626
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
Honey,

627
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
is it fun to do this?

628
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
What?

629
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
I mean,

630
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,700
is it fun

631
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
to watch me so closely?

632
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Honey.

633
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Honey, what are you talking about?

634
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
Do you remember Lao He?

635
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,700
He's dead.

636
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
He died of jealousy.

637
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Honey.

638
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,700
He's only 46.

639
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,220
He's only 10 years older.

640
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,220
Honey, I'm thinking.

641
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,220
I've been so happy

642
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,220
for only 10 years.

643
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
Really.

644
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
Only 10 years.

645
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
I can promise you that after 10 years,

646
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,220
I'll be sure to go home and live with you.

647
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
But before that,

648
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,220
I don't want to make myself suffer.

649
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,220
No.

650
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
Honey, what are you talking about?

651
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,740
Honey, honey.

652
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
You said you'd love me forever.

653
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
You promised me

654
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
that you'd only be good to me.

655
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
In Mount Putong,

656
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,740
you said it in front of the Buddha.

657
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
Don't you remember?

658
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
I do.

659
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I remember everything.

660
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
But people

661
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
change.

662
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,260
What changes?

663
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,260
Are you rich

664
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
or am I old?

665
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,260
Neither.

666
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
Neither.

667
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I...

668
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
I overcame myself.

669
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I overcame humanity.

670
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
You can tell me

671
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
what you want.

672
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,260
It's no big deal

673
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,260
if you tell me.

674
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
It's boring if you don't.

675
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
I understand how you feel.

676
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,260
I'm sorry.

677
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
When did I become like this?

678
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Or

679
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,780
I was always like this

680
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
when I grew up?

681
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
Sometimes I feel

682
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,780
that growing up is really annoying.

683
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I was so happy when I was young.

684
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
I couldn't finish

685
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,780
talking to myself all night.

686
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
I could talk about everything

687
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
but it couldn't solve any problems.

688
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
But

689
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
I felt

690
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
that talking about

691
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
all the unhappy things

692
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
made me feel much better.

693
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
I thought

694
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,300
it would be fine if I told you.

695
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,300
But now...

696
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
I feel

697
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
that I'm not the only one.

698
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
What about you?

699
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,300
What do you want to say?

700
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
How long do you have left?

701
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
It's still a while.

702
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Hurry up.

703
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Go to bed early.

704
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,820
I'm flying at 9 tomorrow.

705
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,820
9?

706
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,820
I can't get up. You can go by yourself.

707
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
Leave me alone.

708
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,820
It's okay.

709
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Tell me where you want to go.

710
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,820
I'll ask Mr. Liu to send you.

711
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,820
Why are you in such a hurry?

712
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,820
What's wrong? Are you afraid I won't leave?

713
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,820
I really can't stand

714
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,820
having someone else at home.

715
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
My mom asked me to stay at the hotel.

716
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
I know. Don't explain it to me.

717
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,340
Hurry up.

718
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Forget it.

719
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
I'm not going to say it.

720
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,340
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,340
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,340
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,340
I'm sorry.

725
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,340
I'm sorry.

726
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,340
I'm sorry.
