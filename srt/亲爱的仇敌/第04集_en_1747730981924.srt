You

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,920
Many successful men will have five emotional stages like this, corresponding to the five women he likes

8
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,920
The first is called the basic form, which means to meet some of his basic needs

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Get married, have children, take care of him

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,920
The second is called the auxiliary form, which means when he just started his career, he wanted to find a woman who could help him get by

11
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,920
The third stage is called the compensatory form, which means he has already given too much, and he wants to find himself some sweet points

12
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
At this time, he is looking for some attractive women

13
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,920
The fourth stage is called the challenging form, which means when a man is in a crisis, he wants to prove that he is still young

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,920
The fifth stage is called the conservative form, which means he has to admit that he is indeed old, and the woman he is looking for is called the nanny

15
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,920
You can compare yourself and see which stage your husband is in

16
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
The second stage

17
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
The third

18
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
The third

19
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,920
That's right, after our analysis of your husband's portrait, he is now in the third stage

20
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,920
The type of interest is the compensatory form, which means young, beautiful, and very attractive women

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
The fourth stage

22
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
Qing Chen, why are you here?

23
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Are you here to find someone?

24
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,920
I'm going to open the door for my roommate

25
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm here to help my husband deliver the dessert

26
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Why don't you wait for me in the lobby? Let's have dinner together

27
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
No, I'm afraid my roommate is waiting

28
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Yes, I'm waiting

29
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Then I won't bother you, or I won't have time to knock on the door of the other person, which is awkward

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm leaving

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,920
Someone said that women's friendship is reinforced by a bunch of shits

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:35,080
The one who got married is looking for a friend to be her

33
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Happy

34
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
What's wrong? Did you forget something?

35
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,920
No, I just wanted to tell you that I didn't lie

36
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
I left not to open the door for my roommate, but to meet a friend here

37
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
But I didn't expect that she got married

38
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm sorry for lying

39
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Actually, it's just a small thing, there's no need to go around, right?

40
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Happy

41
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Honey

42
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I told you, the heat is so high

43
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Honey, don't you have a backache?

44
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Do you sleep in this room?

45
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,920
What? Checking the port? No one is here

46
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Miss Tian Luo left

47
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
What nonsense? You are Miss Tian Luo

48
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,920
What did I do?

49
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You ate

50
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
It's all gone, don't eat it

51
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,920
No, it's not a pity to eat it

52
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
If you don't eat it, I'll tell you not to come, you won't listen

53
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:17,920
What are you doing? Just say it

54
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Is it delicious?

55
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Not bad

56
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
It's all cold, it's not delicious, right?

57
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
It's okay, it's all good things

58
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Your husband loves his son very much

59
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Your son is the tie of your relationship, you should remind him often

60
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Honey, I went to pick up Tiao Tiao yesterday

61
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I heard that Tiao Tiao is sitting in the school, she can't even speak

62
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Don't talk to her, there are many rules in kindergarten

63
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
You said that the teacher just sit in the class, right?

64
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
You put two hands on the table, even adults can't stand it

65
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Not to mention children, they are sick

66
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,920
That's right, no wonder the experts always say that Tiao Tiao needs her father's company

67
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Needs a man's role model

68
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,920
A friend gave me a set of lego a few days ago, Tiao Tiao can't bear to use it

69
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,920
She always asks me when dad will come back, I want to use it with dad

70
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
You...

71
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Really, if you don't believe me, ask her yourself

72
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Honey, I found that my son is a tool for you

73
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm leaving

74
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I just came for a few minutes, you are leaving?

75
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Go to pick up your son

76
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
So, they didn't sleep?

77
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
No

78
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,920
I even took a picture of her bed, the bed sheet is very flat

79
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
She can't let Fu Yan in at this time

80
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
This is the adult best friend

81
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
When you are down, she will tell you everything

82
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,920
When she is done, she will show you the full potential

83
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
By the way, baby, I have no time to ask you, you and Zhou Muxun...

84
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,920
She is very affectionate, I think she is free

85
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
You are joking, Zhou Muxun needs to be affectionate to you

86
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Come on baby, I love you

87
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
You too

88
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Tiao Tiao, dad is listening to the song with you, okay?

89
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Yeah, great

90
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I'll do this, I'll go to do something else

91
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Okay, over there

92
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Okay

93
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,920
At this stage, it's normal to have emotions, but please control your emotions

94
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Hold your breath, do what you should do for this family

95
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
How's me?

96
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
You see, dad the kid left us a present for each other

97
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
when you thunder the gun

98
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
You hurt me!

99
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
I hurt you!

100
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
I am a kid

101
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Come on, come on, come on.

102
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Come on, come on.

103
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
This moment is so beautiful.

104
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,920
It's worth all the effort to protect it.

105
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Come on, come on, come on.

106
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Come on, come on.

107
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I'm here.

108
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Take your time.

109
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Don't be in a rush at this time.

110
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
We'll go up after 10 minutes.

111
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Why 10 minutes?

112
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
It makes us look elegant.

113
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
It's not a big deal.

114
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It's just a small thing.

115
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
It's not a big deal.

116
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,920
It makes us look elegant.

117
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
It's not a big deal.

118
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
It's just the right time.

119
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Sit down.

120
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Thank you.

121
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Why did you send me a message when you arrived?

122
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
You could have told me earlier.

123
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
I would have come up earlier.

124
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
I guess you're busy.

125
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
If I get there soon,

126
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I'll send you a message.

127
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
It's like I'm urging you.

128
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Come on, take a look.

129
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Men are actually more surprised than women.

130
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
They say you can choose.

131
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,920
But they're also considering the price.

132
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Do you often come to this restaurant?

133
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Is there anything you recommend?

134
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Follow your instinct.

135
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Don't miss any chance to take a risk.

136
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Okay.

137
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Be careful.

138
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Dad, you should eat more vegetables.

139
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Tiao Tiao is a big baby.

140
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
She's so sensible.

141
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,920
I often tell her the story of Kong Rong Rang Li.

142
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
What nonsense?

143
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
She's the one who told me to kill the three of them.

144
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Please wait a moment.

145
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Mr. Chen, Mrs. Chen, eat first.

146
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
I'll wait for her in Tiao Tiao's room.

147
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Okay.

148
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Tiao Tiao, eat up.

149
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
You have to go to class after eating.

150
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Tiao Tiao,

151
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
how long are you going to eat like this?

152
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm waiting for you.

153
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm afraid that after class,

154
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Daddy will leave.

155
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,920
You really don't want to teach her?

156
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Son, I'm not leaving.

157
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
I'll work in the study later.

158
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
I'll wait for you to finish your class.

159
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Let's make a deal.

160
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Okay, let's make a deal.

161
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Make a deal.

162
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Tiao Tiao, don't change for a hundred years.

163
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
If you change, you're a puppy.

164
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Tiao Tiao.

165
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Mr. Yang, your method is so useful.

166
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,920
This birdie is really a birdie assistant.

167
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I didn't expect us to meet again so soon.

168
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I always thought we would meet very soon.

169
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Actually, that day,

170
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Xixi wanted to work with you and Zhong Qingcheng.

171
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I'm just a guest who made a mistake.

172
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Anyway,

173
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I have to thank Chen Kaixi.

174
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
You're a master.

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
But don't you guys like

176
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
young and pretty girls?

177
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I mean, young and pretty girls

178
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
who are under 25 years old

179
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,920
and pretty enough to be a female celebrity.

180
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Who made such a boring standard for us?

181
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Isn't it?

182
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm writing a love story recently.

183
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
It's a bit stuck.

184
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
So I'd like to ask you

185
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,920
why the male lead

186
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,920
fell in love with the female lead.

187
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
It's stuck here.

188
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Life is simple.

189
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
A man falls in love with a woman

190
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
because she's pretty,

191
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
has a good education, background,

192
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
family, and training.

193
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
And she's young.

194
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
It's best to provide emotional value

195
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
and emotional management.

196
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Right?

197
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,920
But these things sound

198
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
not so sweet

199
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
and not so idol-like.

200
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Luo Man,

201
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
you're interesting.

202
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Including your prejudice against men.

203
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Is it?

204
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Luo Man,

205
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
who's going to try first?

206
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
You do.

207
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
In the script,

208
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
the female lead is

209
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
the brave little white flower.

210
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
The female lead is

211
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
the bright and beautiful white woman.

212
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
In the script,

213
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
the female lead is

214
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
the brave little white flower.

215
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
But if you were the scriptwriter,

216
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
who would you want to win?

217
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I'm not sure.

218
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm not sure.

219
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm not sure.

220
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm a little embarrassed to admit it.

221
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
But the truth is,

222
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
I've been in love with both of them.

223
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
But the standard of responsibility

224
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
you mentioned earlier

225
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
should be set by young people.

226
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Only young people

227
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
can imagine their partner

228
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,920
so detailed and perfect.

229
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
At my age,

230
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
all I want to do

231
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
is to be with

232
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
someone who can make you happy.

233
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
He said he only wants to be with

234
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
someone who can make him happy.

235
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I think he's a pretty interesting person.

236
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Big sister,

237
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
he doesn't care about those little things.

238
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
It's because he's not going to get married again.

239
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I'm not going to get married.

240
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I'm going to be a good friend.

241
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm going to be a good friend.

242
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm going to be a good friend.

243
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
What are you up to?

244
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm at the computer.

245
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'll be right back.

246
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
How's your wound, brother?

247
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Pretty good.

248
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I don't know what's wrong with me,

249
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
and I'm a little cold.

250
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Honey, don't drink coffee all the time.

251
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
But what the hell is wrong with me?

252
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Remember,

253
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
don't blame him

254
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
to cool down your emotions and warm you up.

255
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Honey, coffee makes you sleepy.

256
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Here, have some tea without coffee.

257
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
What are you doing?

258
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
I'm feeding you.

259
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
You're busy, so I can't help you.

260
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Don't do this to me.

261
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I feel so nervous.

262
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You're like my mom.

263
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
When I was a kid, my mom cooked fish.

264
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
She said she didn't like fish.

265
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Then she watched me and my brother eat.

266
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
When she went back to the kitchen,

267
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
she smashed the rest of the fish bones.

268
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,920
I don't feel touched at all.

269
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm scared.

270
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
My mom is like that.

271
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
She's moved by herself.

272
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
It's a disease.

273
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Okay, I'll eat.

274
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Don't do this again.

275
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
I have a hand.

276
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm a hand.

277
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
I'm scolded by you.

278
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I have to help you.

279
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Okay.

280
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I'm sure his contribution

281
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
reminds him how important he is to this family.

282
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,920
When necessary, he can be more kind.

283
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Honey.

284
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
You have gray hair.

285
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
But you can't pull it out.

286
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
The more you pull, the more it will hide.

287
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Honey.

288
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I don't usually have any chance to tell you.

289
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I want to thank you.

290
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,920
I want to thank you for everything you've done for this family.

291
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
You're the only one in our family.

292
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Thank you for working hard every day.

293
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,920
You've done everything for us.

294
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,920
I'm really thankful to God

295
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
for giving me such an outstanding man.

296
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
But don't be too tired.

297
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Your health is the most important thing.

298
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Do you know?

299
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Of course, the most important thing is

300
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,920
that we three are together.

301
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
It's not order.

302
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
It's just gray hair.

303
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
I'll be fine tomorrow.

304
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Are these made by Luo Man?

305
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Only a woman can do it.

306
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
She's pretty good.

307
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Didn't you say she wrote all the songs

308
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
about the little girl with the sickle?

309
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Did I say that?

310
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
I'm really interesting.

311
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Luo Man is good.

312
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
She broke out of the game.

313
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Was she the first one in your class?

314
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
What is she writing now?

315
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Dad!

316
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Son, class is over.

317
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Come on.

318
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Daddy.

319
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
Mr. Chen, Mrs. Chen, I'm going home.

320
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Okay.

321
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I'll watch the Ultraman with you.

322
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Then we'll sleep together.

323
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Let's fly.

324
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Let's fly!

325
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Really?

326
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
You know that restaurant too?

327
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
No way.

328
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
I thought that restaurant was not that famous.

329
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
And it's not a star, a star, a star.

330
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Anyway, many of my favorite friends

331
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
don't know about it.

332
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
I actually like Barcelona very much.

333
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,920
I didn't expect to meet such an interesting restaurant.

334
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
It seems that

335
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
we have to go there together.

336
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Cheers.

337
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Are you tired?

338
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
No.

339
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Do you want to go to my house to watch a movie?

340
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Okay.

341
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Our house is very close.

342
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
It takes about ten minutes to walk.

343
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm a little full.

344
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
I want to take a walk.

345
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Do you mind?

346
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
I'm fine.

347
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
I'll walk for a while.

348
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

349
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Okay.

350
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

351
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

352
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Okay.

353
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

354
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

355
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

356
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
I want to take a walk.

357
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Do you mind?

358
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
No.

359
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
I can walk very well.

360
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Let's go.

361
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Why are you like a child?

362
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Am I not allowed to?

363
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
It's okay.

364
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Do you like it?

365
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
How much is it?

366
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Five yuan.

367
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
You choose.

368
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Three yuan.

369
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Two pairs of pairs.

370
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Thank you.

371
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Okay.

372
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Thank you.

373
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Ten yuan.

374
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
You're so happy.

375
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Thank you.

376
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Good night.

377
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Good night.

378
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Please come in.

379
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Your grandpa is so nice.

380
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I like to have a wider view.

381
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Me too.

382
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Come here.

383
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Do you have a vase?

384
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Sit.

385
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
You can sit closer.

386
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
What's wrong?

387
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
Let me hug you.

388
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
What's wrong?

389
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Are you watching a movie?

390
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Watch a movie.

391
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Change your image.

392
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Create a surprise.

393
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,920
The relationship between a couple is the most important part.

394
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Don't just stand there.

395
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,920
You have to provide fun and freshness.

396
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
I'm sorry.

397
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
I'm sorry.

398
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Do you want to take a shower now?

399
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Let's go.

400
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm sorry.

401
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Honey.

402
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
This is the bathroom.

403
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
This is the bathroom.

404
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Here are the towels, bath towels, bath coats, and slippers.

405
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
The shampoo and shower are in there.

406
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Oh, right.

407
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,920
The toothbrush is in the drawer behind you.

408
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,920
If you need anything,

409
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
feel free to tell me.

410
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
I'm sorry.

411
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
I'm sorry.

412
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm really a little confused about something.

413
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
I'm sorry.

414
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Honey,

415
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
since you're ready,

416
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
you should go shower first.

417
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Honey, I just wanted to say

418
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
that I have a meeting at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

419
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
I need to go back to the city early tomorrow.

420
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Can't you go back tomorrow morning?

421
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm driving for half an hour now.

422
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,000
If you want to book a cab tomorrow morning,

423
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,120
you have to wait for an hour and a half.

424
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,200
Honey,

425
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,240
I can sleep for an extra hour.

426
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm sorry for your loss, okay?

427
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,280
Be good.

428
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,040
Honey!

429
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,000
Be careful!

430
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,320
Honey, don't go.

431
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,000
Why are you so sad for me?

432
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
We haven't been to the hospital for a long time.

433
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,520
Honey,

434
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,920
next time.

435
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,640
Next time.

436
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,240
Next time?

437
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,760
When is the next time?

438
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
I have a phone call meeting later.

439
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,560
Honey, be good, okay?

440
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,320
I love you.

441
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,160
Be good, okay?

442
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,240
Why don't you blow dry your hair?

443
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,560
It will hurt your head.

444
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,560
I'll blow it almost dry.

445
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,520
research

446
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:00,760
research

447
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,280
research

448
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,320
research

449
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,800
yolk

450
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,120
egg

451
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,700
egg

452
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,460

egg

462
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,280
Shall we

463
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,720
talk a little?

464
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Is it inconvenient today?

465
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Why is that?

466
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,640
You can tell me when I invite you home that you don't want to.

467
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,640
You can also tell me when I ask you if you want to take a shower that you don't want to go to bed and you want to go home.

468
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,640
What do you mean by this now?

469
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,640
I don't want to go home either. I quite enjoy being with you.

470
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
But you don't want to go to bed with me.

471
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
I...

472
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
I...

473
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
You are a woman like a bee.

474
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Okay, I respect your choice.

475
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,640
When you are ready, I will ask Si Yi to send you home.

476
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Are you pushing me away?

477
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Miss Luo, I...

478
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,640
I am not used to having someone sleeping beside me.

479
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I have a bad sleep.

480
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,640
So I can't accept any noise or other interference.

481
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,640
But if I go to bed with you today, you can bear with me for a night, right?

482
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Wait a minute, Senbin.

483
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Honey, what's wrong with you?

484
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
Don't bother me, okay?

485
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Bother? How can I bother you?

486
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,640
You used to come to school to find me after work at 11.30.

487
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Just to stay one night.

488
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,640
You woke up at 6 in the morning and bought breakfast for me.

489
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,640
You drove 6.30 in the morning and took two subway.

490
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,640
You had to drive a lot of cars to get to the station.

491
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Why didn't you bother me then?

492
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,640
Senbin, don't you want me anymore?

493
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Honey, what's wrong with you?

494
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,640
I have told you that I just want to make it clear.

495
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
What's wrong with you?

496
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,640
I have told you that I just want to sleep one more hour in the morning.

497
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Just one more hour.

498
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
Why are you so confused?

499
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,640
I know. I am leaving.

500
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Put on your shoes.

501
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I will walk you down the stairs.

502
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,640
No need. I can walk myself.

503
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,640
It's okay. I am going down the stairs to get some fresh air.

504
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
I am going to sleep.

505
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
I am going to sleep.

506
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
I am going to sleep.

507
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
I am going to sleep.

508
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
I am going to sleep.

509
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
I am going to sleep.

510
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
I am going to sleep.

511
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
I am going to sleep.

512
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I am going to sleep.

513
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I am going to sleep.

514
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
I am going to sleep.

515
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
I am going to sleep.

516
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,640
I am going to sleep.

517
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I am going to sleep.

518
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,640
I am going to sleep.

519
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I am going to sleep.

520
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,640
I am going to sleep.

521
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I am going to sleep.

522
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I am going to sleep.

523
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I am going to sleep.

524
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
I am going to sleep.

525
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
I am going to sleep.

526
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,640
I am going to sleep.

527
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,640
I am going to sleep.

528
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
I am going to sleep.

529
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
I am going to sleep.

530
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
I am going to sleep.

531
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:35,640
The show is endless.

532
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,640
I finally learned something.

533
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,640
It doesn't matter if I am born or die.

534
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:53,640
Life will always come to an end.

535
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,640
No matter if you will be back.

536
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,640
Thank you for doing everything.

537
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,640
Let yourself be the one who is good.

538
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,640
With life from the beginning to the end.

539
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:27,640
How did you think it wasn't me?
