00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Encore.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm sure you can hear me.

I haven't seen you for a long time.

13
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,120
We have Rosévara's filming.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
I hope you agree to...

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,880
Are you thin?

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
VIDEO

17
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
LAST Aurouse

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,420
What is this time?

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,740
Are you living well?

20
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,160
Good, very bad.

21
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,340
You...

22
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
how come?

23
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,940
How many pieces?

24
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,320
Five.

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,140
Fifteen, それ yard house.

26
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Look at Mo palace!

27
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,060
Any move you can set the date?

28
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
No realizes what happened with you.

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,700
The evolution of history Traitor.

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,420
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,660
Dr. Fang is here.

32
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,660
It's good to see you.

33
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,860
How did you get hurt?

34
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,700
I got hit by a ball.

35
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,140
Usually, you get hit by a ball

36
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,300
by your ankle or shoulder.

37
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,700
What did you do with your waist?

38
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
I just got up

39
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,900
and killed a ball.

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,340
I felt uncomfortable when I landed.

41
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,140
I might have been squatting.

42
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,740
I felt like I couldn't move after the end.

43
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,700
Does it hurt so much?

44
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,540
Does it hurt?

45
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,780
Not really.

46
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,140
Okay.

47
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,460
I'll just do the shoulder massage.

48
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,820
You'll have a back-to-back CT scan later.

49
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,060
Don't exercise these days.

50
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,860
Take a rest in the bedroom.

51
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,180
Luoman.

52
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,020
What is it?

53
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,180
I'm opening the deliveries for you.

54
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,380
Move in at night.

55
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,540
Shall we go eat tomorrow?

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,820
I won't eat mais.

57
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,580
Fang and I went to flyboard because of an appointment.

58
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,700
Yes.

59
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,260
I have to thank you after you eat.

60
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Yes, we've already agreed.

61
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
You and Dr. Fang are very close.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,780
My dad helped a lot when he was in the hospital.

63
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,660
Thank you, Dr. Fang.

64
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,540
Thank you, Dr. Tang.

65
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,140
You said that auntie is so kind.

66
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,940
We are close to each other.

67
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,380
We are all close.

68
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,380
Have you known each other for a long time?

69
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
Yes.

70
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
We knew each other when he was in college.

71
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
My brother and sister-in-law were in love.

72
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,380
They said that she was very talented.

73
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
I was impressed.

74
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,980
Okay, let the patient rest.

75
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
We'll leave now.

76
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,580
Mr. Zhou,

77
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,580
don't be so hard on yourself.

78
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Yes, you can't compare with your younger ones.

79
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
You can use the toilet to clean the toilet.

80
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,780
You can use the machine outside.

81
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,180
Let me do it.

82
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
I'll do it with you.

83
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,580
Thank you.

84
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,780
Please come in.

85
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Come in.

86
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,780
What would you like?

87
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Thank you.

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,980
Please help me.

89
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Please help me.

90
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
I'll wait for you.

91
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,780
Hello?

92
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
Hello, my husband.

93
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
You are in Shanghai.

94
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,380
You are late.

95
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,380
It's late today, I'm tired.

96
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,380
It's so hot here, I'm sweating.

97
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,380
Is the weather getting better?

98
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
I'll go to the toilet first.

99
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
Did you sleep?

100
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,380
I slept early.

101
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Tomorrow, I have a meeting with Mr. Yu.

102
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,380
You should go to bed early.

103
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,380
By the way, I'll take Fang Cheng over for dinner.

104
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,380
Call Luo Man.

105
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
Hello, is there anything else?

106
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,380
It's okay, honey.

107
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,380
Good night.

108
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,380
The day after tomorrow

109
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Miss Luo.

110
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,380
By the way, I didn't transfer the money to you.

111
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Okay, I'll go to see the doctor.

112
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,380
I'll go in first, Mr. Zhou.

113
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
Thank you.

114
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Take good care of your health.

115
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
Luo Man.

116
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,380
I don't care if you believe me.

117
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,380
I want to say that I'm happy to see you again.

118
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
I'll transfer the money to you later.

119
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,380
No need.

120
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
You said that

121
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
the one we knew before

122
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
was quite true.

123
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,380
I almost lied to you.

124
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
I just want to say that you're kind,

125
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,380
patient, and kind.

126
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Are you going to work today?

127
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
I'll clean up later.

128
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,380
We'll go together.

129
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,380
Where are you going?

130
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,380
We'll eat together.

131
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
We don't have any problems.

132
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
We don't have any problems.

133
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
Do you have any problems?

134
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,380
Do you have us?

135
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,380
I admit that I'm a coward.

136
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,940
In the last few days,

137
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Thus I spent Conference.

138
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,040
Good morning,

139
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,540
From one subject to another.

140
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
Hello?

141
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
Where are you?

142
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
I'm downstairs.

143
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
Remember to run.

144
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,380
Chen Mian and Liang Che are waiting for me.

145
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Last weekend, Chen Mian should go to Shanghai.

146
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,380
One night, I suddenly received a message.

147
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
I've informed the violation of my rule.

148
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,380
I opened the app and saw the violation.

149
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Who is this woman? Do you know her?

150
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
I don't know.

151
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,380
Do you know what's the most suspicious thing that happened?

152
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,380
It's not that Chen Mian is out of the house again.

153
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,380
But I didn't feel any surprise.

154
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,380
I thought she changed her mind and didn't eat the food.

155
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,380
But I was too weak after I got the food.

156
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
I didn't want to face the reality.

157
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,380
I can't pretend to see anything.

158
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Wei Zhang's address is Fu Youbao's house.

159
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,380
What do you mean?

160
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
She's out of the house?

161
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Is she crazy?

162
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Then...

163
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Then...

164
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,380
What should we do?

165
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
What should we do?

166
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,380
What can we do?

167
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,380
If we have a child, it's a lifetime.

168
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,380
We can't let go of this.

169
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,380
How about this?

170
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,380
First, we can't be angry.

171
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,380
Second, we have to be steady.

172
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,380
We have to catch all the evidence in our own hands.

173
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,380
Look at who that woman is.

174
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,380
What step they took.

175
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
And whether that child is her.

176
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,380
We have to take the evidence in our own hands.

177
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
We decide whether it's a big deal or not.

178
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
We have to discuss it step by step.

179
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,380
I know.

180
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
I thought so.

181
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,380
I've been studying medicine for the past few days.

182
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,380
I still have time.

183
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,380
It's all because of you.

184
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,380
I'm so busy.

185
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,380
You have to listen to me.

186
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,380
But I also...

187
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
I have something to say.

188
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
Isn't it because Chen Kaixi is sick?

189
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Why do you tell me this?

190
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
Okay.

191
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Cry if you want to.

192
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Don't be sad.

193
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
I just want to cry.

194
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,380
But I don't think I can.

195
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,380
I think I can't work hard.

196
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Let's do it.

197
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
Extend thoroughly,

198
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
and try the little pincer.

199
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,380
Put some air on,

200
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Holiday Hospital will buy it.

201
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,380
And if you can buy a嗎?

202
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Shop Metropolis in love.

203
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
And don't forget to give me the thread.

204
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
I've gone to Ma Bo.

205
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
You have to be extremely careful.

206
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Of course, it's been a long time since I've been careful.

207
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
It's like keeping everything as it is.

208
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
I've been through this.

209
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
I've been staying at home for months.

210
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,380
He likes to play games.

211
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
He really likes to play games.

212
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,380
He said he's too good at drinking tea and playing mahjong.

213
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
He's too young to play games.

214
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,380
Who's the good guy who uses computers to play?

215
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
He's not good at playing games.

216
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
He said he's good at playing games.

217
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,380
He didn't turn on the light.

218
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Is that how he doesn't do anything?

219
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,380
You said you'd bring your friends to play,

220
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
but you didn't want them to touch you.

221
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Zhong Qingcheng?

222
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
I'm not sure if I'm the one who's the best at it.

223
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
I'm not sure if I'm the one who's the best at it.

224
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,380
I'm not sure if I'm the one who's the best at it.

225
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm sure it's an actor.

226
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,380
You're back.

227
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Didn't I tell you that I'm back?

228
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
Are you waiting for me?

229
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
You'll be back soon.

230
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
You're so good at it.

231
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Who's waiting for you?

232
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
I'm waiting for Mr. Kang from the meeting.

233
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
Didn't we stop the show?

234
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
He's still interested.

235
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
He asked me to come over for a chat.

236
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
How come I remember

237
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,380
you didn't eat this kind of food before?

238
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,380
If you ate it,

239
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
how could you be so good at it?

240
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,380
I can't.

241
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
The market is bad.

242
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
How long have you been waiting?

243
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Two hours.

244
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Are you stupid?

245
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,380
Why are you still waiting?

246
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,380
He's definitely not here.

247
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
Come on, let's have lunch together.

248
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm not hungry.

249
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
I'm hungry.

250
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
Let's have a meal together.

251
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
A meal together again?

252
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
We're from the hotel.

253
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,380
Qingcheng,

254
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
I'm calling you.

255
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
If you still have this kind of situation,

256
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
you'd better go.

257
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
They don't want to eat with you.

258
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
But don't blame them.

259
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
This year,

260
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
they're all the same.

261
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,380
It's good that you're not here.

262
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
You've been drinking and vomiting

263
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,380
for several times.

264
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
No,

265
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
you're a human being.

266
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
You should go

267
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
for the investment.

268
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Shouldn't you be

269
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
a producer?

270
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
I thought

271
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
they just wanted me to go talk to them.

272
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
So that they can

273
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
be more lively and more interesting.

274
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
I'm just a little bit more relaxed.

275
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
They're so mean.

276
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
If I could really drink,

277
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
I'd drink it.

278
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
It's not like anything.

279
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
It's not like you.

280
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
You should at least have a word.

281
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
What are you talking about?

282
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
It's not because you're so pretty.

283
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,380
You think your brother

284
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
is telling the truth to anyone?

285
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
You're a monkey.

286
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
You're like a monkey.

287
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
No,

288
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
I was just saying the truth.

289
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
You don't know that

290
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
I'm tired

291
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
and like a dog.

292
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,380
I'm just here

293
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
to give you a break.

294
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
I can relax a little.

295
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
So what do you think

296
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,380
you're doing?

297
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
What do I do?

298
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
It's not easy

299
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,380
to live a happy life.

300
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
I just want to eat and drink.

301
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Mr. Zhou,

302
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
Ms. Lu Man is in Donghuang.

303
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
She just sent the wine

304
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
as a secret order.

305
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
Since everyone is so familiar,

306
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,380
just say it clearly.

307
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
What's wrong with you and Chen Mian?

308
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
You...

309
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
You're suspecting me?

310
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
No, I'm sick.

311
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I'm raising a child for Chen Mian.

312
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
I'm a business merchant now.

313
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Don't joke.

314
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
I don't want money.

315
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Chen Mian is your family.

316
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
He's so capable.

317
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Why does he let me

318
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,380
pay such a big price?

319
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Does he deserve it?

320
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
Am I crazy?

321
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
You're crazy.

322
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
He doesn't deserve it.

323
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Just say it.

324
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
But you and him

325
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
are so good at

326
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
chatting in the game.

327
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,380
I'm so naive.

328
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
I usually call my sisters

329
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,380
and your sisters

330
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
are all fake.

331
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,380
You just can't see me.

332
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
If you do this,

333
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
you can just put this

334
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
shit on my head.

335
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,380
Fine.

336
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
Fine? I'm wrong.

337
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,380
I'm the one who's lying.

338
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,380
Fine?

339
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
Forget it.

340
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
It's not a matter of reputation.

341
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,380
Just think of it as our mistake.

342
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
I hope

343
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,380
you can stay here for the last time.

344
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
And the last time.

345
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Listen.

346
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
Don't go.

347
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
I really want to go

348
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
to this step.

349
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
Listen.

350
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
Keep looking down.

351
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
There's a big melon.

352
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,380
Who's that?

353
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
Who?

354
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
Mine.

355
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Who's that?

356
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
Who?

357
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,380
Mine.

358
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Mine.

359
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Fang Chi and Liu Yiran.

360
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
Are you really fake?

361
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,380
I even bet on them

362
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
a week's milk tea.

363
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Men are actors.

364
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,380
They can be fake.

365
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
They can be real.

366
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
The little doctor

367
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,380
must be alive.

368
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Are you going to shoot a video

369
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380
and then you're going to shoot a cp?

370
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Are you going to stop?

371
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
Stop?

372
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
But the audience loves to see it.

373
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
Maybe they'll just

374
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
act like they're real.

375
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
Can you call them real?

376
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
They're real.

377
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
They're not fake.

378
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Are you really fake?

379
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Or are you still young?

380
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
You're so young.

381
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Then go in.

382
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
I'm waiting for you.

383
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,380
What's wrong?

384
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Help me clean up.

385
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
I don't know how to do it.

386
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
You do?

387
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,380
I really don't know how to do it.

388
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
I don't know how to do it.

389
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,380
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
This is the journey he's been through these days.

391
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,380
Time is short.

392
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,380
I think

393
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
maybe

394
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,380
there's not one person.

395
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,380
Just say it.

396
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
They basically

397
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
have been dating

398
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
outside for a long time.

399
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
They're not dating.

400
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,380
They're just dating.

401
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
They basically

402
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
have been dating outside

403
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
for a long time.

404
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
They won't be back

405
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
to the long-distance hotel.

406
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Then do you want to go to the

407
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
security hospital?

408
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
No.

409
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Then it's definitely not the next one.

410
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Maybe that day

411
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
they just got back

412
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,380
and just passed by.

413
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Don't believe me.

414
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,380
I'll stay with you for a while.

415
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
We're just having lunch.

416
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Do you know what it feels like?

417
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
Every day,

418
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
you're just looking at me.

419
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380
I can't help but fall in love.

420
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Every time I feel like

421
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,380
I can't be sad anymore.

422
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
Then something more disgusting

423
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
will happen.

424
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
Dad,

425
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
go and make a video with me.

426
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Don't run.

427
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
He hasn't dried up yet.

428
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
Son.

429
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Dad.

430
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
I miss you.

431
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Dad, did I get it?

432
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
I got it.

433
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
Son,

434
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
did you get the gift

435
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
that dad bought you?

436
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
I did, Dad.

437
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Thank you, Dad.

438
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Don't buy me a cake.

439
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
I can't finish it.

440
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
I told you

441
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
that I'll play with him on the weekend.

442
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
I didn't get it.

443
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,380
I made it up for my son.

444
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,380
A man should be honest.

445
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
Right?

446
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,380
You're really a good boy.

447
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Dad,

448
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
we won.

449
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
We went to the 3-0.

450
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
I got two balls.

451
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
I'm not giving up.

452
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
3-0, son.

453
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
You got two balls.

454
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
That's great, son.

455
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
You're really great.

456
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
I think I'm really good.

457
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
I'm not giving up.

458
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,380
I'm not giving up.

459
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
I'm not giving up.

460
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,380
I'm not giving up.

461
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
I'm not giving up.

462
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
I'll keep it up.

463
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
Mom.

464
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
Baby.

465
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
What is it?

466
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
How do I look?

467
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,380
Mom,

468
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,380
can I sleep with you tonight?

469
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Sure.

470
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
I'm the best mommy.

471
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
Really?

472
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Really.

473
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,380
My mommy is the best mommy in the world.

474
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,380
The best mommy.

475
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,380
The best mommy.

476
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,380
Mommy's baby is also the best baby in the world.

477
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,380
The best mommy.

478
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,380
I love you.

479
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,380
I...

480
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,380
Go to sleep.

481
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
I love you.

482
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,380
Can you speak?

483
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
I love you.

484
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
Hello?

485
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,380
Hello, Xi Xi.

486
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,380
I found it.

487
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,380
I think it's the right thing to do.

488
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Tell me.

489
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,380
Do you want to sit down first?

490
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,380
Pour a glass of water to calm down.

491
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
It's okay.

492
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
You just say it.

493
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I'm not going to do it.

494
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm just going to sit down.

495
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
It's okay.

496
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
You just say it.

497
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,380
It's all a lie.

498
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:14,380
I remember I read a drama.

499
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,380
The female lead in it said,

500
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,380
if I were in the hell,

501
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,380
I would also know

502
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
what kind of hell I was in.

503
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Xi Xi.

504
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
You really became a beast.

505
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Go in.

506
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,380
You can't go in here.

507
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,380
Do you think you know this guy?

508
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,380
No wonder I see you're a little bit familiar.

509
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,380
Is it your friend who brought your old lady group?

510
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,380
It's Chen Mian's assistant.

511
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Oh, no. It's Qian's assistant.

512
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,380
He said he was going back to his hometown.

513
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,380
And then he said he didn't want to come back

514
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,380
because he thought he was staying in the old house.

515
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
Chen Mian was so sure.

516
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,380
I even bought a gift for him.

517
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
I want to thank him.

518
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
You just don't have to be so polite.

519
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,380
You and Mr. Mian are so nice to me.

520
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,380
I always thought he was my eyes.

521
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
He's my man.

522
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Is Chen Mian crazy?

523
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Why don't you tell me the truth?

524
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
He even gave birth to a child.

525
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
What did he do?

526
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,380
He did...

527
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
...a convenience store.

528
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,380
Chen Mian has always been so good at dancing.

529
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,380
He said he could eat seafood and fish.

530
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
He could also eat meat buns.

531
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
I always compliment him.

532
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,380
He said he can eat vegetables and food.

533
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
I...

534
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,380
I actually know what he's thinking.

535
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
As long as he's got his assistant,

536
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,380
it's convenient for him to do a few things.

537
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,380
After all, no matter how self-centered he is,

538
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,380
he can't even sleep in the same room.

539
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,380
What's wrong?

540
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
Come on.

541
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Let me get you some water.

542
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,380
Drink some water.

543
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,380
Do you know what's so funny?

544
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,380
He used to say that to me.

545
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,380
My assistant looks like you.

546
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,380
What kind of man would he be?

547
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
Don't say anything.

548
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,380
Let's...

549
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,380
...let's meet a lawyer.

550
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,380
But I still want to remind you of one thing.

551
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,380
The word divorce...

552
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,380
...isn't just a word.

553
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
It's a question.

554
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,380
It's not just one question.

555
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,380
For people like Chen Mian,

556
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
we must be determined and action.

557
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,380
Otherwise, we'll be passive.

558
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,380
We must be extremely focused.

559
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,380
It's okay.

560
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,380
I'm here. I'll be with you.

561
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,380
I know...

562
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,380
...you must be very confused.

563
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
It's okay.

564
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,380
You must be calm...

565
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,380
...and think with me.

566
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,380
You can write whatever you want.

567
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,380
I'll write it.

568
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,380
Thank you.

569
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Do you know what?

570
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,380
Seeing you and Chen Mian...

571
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,380
...doing so many things,

572
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I've never been so cruel to her.

573
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,380
From this day on,

574
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,380
she's also my enemy.

575
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,380
The only enemy is to treat you to dinner.

576
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
Yes.

577
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,380
What are you afraid of?

578
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,380
We're not afraid of anyone.

579
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
I'm here.

580
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Why are you so quiet?

581
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
I'm coming.

582
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,380
Chen Mian.

583
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
What's the big day today?

584
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,380
You're drinking so much.

585
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
I'm not drunk.

586
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
I'm not drunk.

587
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
I'm not drunk.

588
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
I'm not drunk.

589
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
I'm not drunk.

590
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
I'm not drunk.

591
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380
I'm not drunk.

592
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
I'm not drunk.

593
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
You're drinking so much.

594
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,380
The party is over.

595
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
The party is over.

596
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
It must be Ding Ding.

597
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
But Zhou is really helping.

598
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
I have to do my best.

599
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,380
Sorry.

600
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Sit down.

601
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Fill up.

602
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
Tiantiao.

603
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,380
Are you really drunk?

604
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,380
Today, I'm doing it for my family.

605
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,380
I'm telling the truth.

606
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,380
I've been drinking for a few months.

607
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,380
I sometimes think about it.

608
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,380
I don't care.

609
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,380
But it's like this.

610
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,380
You think it's over?

611
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,380
You're not worried?

612
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,380
It's okay.

613
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,380
Zhou.

614
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,380
Thank you so much this time.

615
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,380
Thank you, brother.

616
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,380
Let's not talk about this.

617
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,380
And wife.

618
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,380
Thank you.

619
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,380
I didn't say it in your mouth.

620
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,380
But you worried about me.

621
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,380
Come on, cousin.

622
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,380
Come on.

623
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,380
Come on.

624
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,380
Congratulations, Mr. Chen.

625
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,380
You've done it again.

626
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,380
You have to go to the service department.

627
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,380
I'll find your name.

628
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,380
I'm not a beginner.

629
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
I've told you.

630
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,380
You're so skinny.

631
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,380
You're the most talented.

632
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,380
You're the most talented.

633
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,380
Isn't it time for you to have a rich family?

634
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,380
I'm not a rich family.

635
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,380
I'm just a little bit.

636
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,380
You're not an outsider.

637
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,380
Come on.

638
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,380
Look at your house.

639
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
It's so beautiful.

640
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
I'm so happy.

641
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,380
I like these things.

642
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,380
I didn't think it before.

643
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,380
I was caught by the internet.

644
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,380
The internet company is all about the bad things.

645
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,380
But I feel much better because of these things.

646
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,380
Zhou.

647
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,380
No matter how much it costs,

648
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,380
as long as I go home,

649
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,380
I'll see you in the house.

650
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,380
As long as I go home,

651
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,380
I'll bake the cake and smell it.

652
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,380
I feel so jealous.

653
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
You've lived a long life.

654
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,380
You're still a child.

655
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,380
What's your problem?

656
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,380
I'll take care of the rhythm.

657
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,380
Uncle, I'm at home.

658
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,380
I learned a lot from Kai Qi's video.

659
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,380
Zhao, you're good at cooking.

660
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,380
I'm a good cook.

661
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,380
I'm a cook.

662
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,380
I'm not good at cooking.

663
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
I'm easy to cook.

664
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
Then you should find someone to eat with.

665
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
I don't know.

666
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,380
I'm used to staying alone.

667
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,380
But I'm really sorry for these months.

668
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,380
Sometimes you think

669
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,380
it's good to have a little vacation.

670
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I'm sorry for what Mr. Zhou said.

671
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
But in fact,

672
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,380
I still love myself more.

673
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,380
You little brat.

674
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
You're like a teacher.

675
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,380
How many times have you talked about love?

676
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,380
I'm telling you,

677
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,380
you should find someone who's young and gentle.

678
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,380
You should always be the first one.

679
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
Do you understand?

680
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
You're always the one who cares about you.

681
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,380
This is what I'm talking about.

682
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
It's good to have such an old lady like you.

683
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,380
I'll give you freedom and the final explanation.

684
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,380
I'm afraid you'll be like yesterday.

685
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
I don't agree with that.

686
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
I think

687
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
a woman should be smarter and more initiative.

688
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,380
She should be nice.

689
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,380
Yao Di, you're still too young.

690
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,380
I really need to give

691
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,380
some independent women a break.

692
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,380
Some women

693
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
think they're smart.

694
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,380
They're actually smart.

695
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,380
Those little dishes

696
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,380
are not easy to find.

697
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,380
Why?

698
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,380
I think

699
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,380
a woman should be smart.

700
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,380
Zhou,

701
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,380
I'll ask you again

702
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,380
when you're done eating.

703
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
Yao Di,

704
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,380
don't be too old-fashioned.

705
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,380
You'll have a high blood pressure.

706
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,380
Don't be too excited

707
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,380
when you're not in the hospital.

708
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,380
Why are you so much more?

709
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,380
You're still thinking about the doctor's reward

710
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,380
for your health.

711
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,380
That's right.

712
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,380
Everyone is their own person.

713
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,380
Why do you have to follow

714
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,380
your father?

715
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,380
I'm a very popular editor.

716
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,380
I gave this little word to him.

717
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,380
I really like it.

718
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,380
If you listen to me, you'll have to add money.

719
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,380
I'm sorry, Madam.

720
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,380
This is a gift from Mr. Shen.

721
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,380
But the package is broken.

722
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,380
Why don't you take a look

723
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,380
at what's important?

724
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,380
Okay.

725
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,380
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,380
My head suddenly hurt.

727
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,380
Baby,

728
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,380
why don't you go home first?

729
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,580
Uncle, take care of Wuzhou.

730
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,540
I'll see you later.

731
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,540
Okay.

732
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,380
Auntie, don't worry.

733
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,380
You can buy some water at home.

734
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,380
Okay.

735
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,380
Okay.

736
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,380
Are you a fool?

737
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,380
Are you a fool?

738
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,380
I am.

739
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,380
I am.

740
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,380
I am.

741
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,380
I am.

742
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,380
I am.

743
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,380
I am.

744
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,380
I am.

745
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,380
I am.

746
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,380
Are you a fool?

747
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,380
Are you a fool?

748
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,380
Are you crazy?

749
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
What are you saying?

750
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,380
Look at yourself.

751
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,380
You are mistaken.

752
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,380
You have come to our house.

753
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,380
Are you a family?

754
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,380
How can I be your family?

755
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,380
Are you the kind of people you want to be?

756
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,380
You are not a family.

757
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,380
I am a fool.

758
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,380

I am a fool.

765
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,380
I am a fool.

00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
I am a fool.

768
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,380
I am a fool.

769
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,380
I am a fool.

770
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,380
I am a fool.

771
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,380
I am a fool.

772
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,380
I am a fool.

773
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
I am a fool.

774
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,380
I am a fool.

775
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,380
I am a fool.

776
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,380
I am a fool.

777
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,380
I am a fool.

778
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,380
I am a fool.

779
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,380
Dear hurting.

780
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,380
I will look at a ghost

781
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,380
all the time.

782
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,380
I am so busy

783
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,380
I will walk to the end

784
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,380
No matter what you do, I will be with you

785
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,380
Thank you for everything you do

786
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,380
Let the one you want to be

787
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:35,380
With this life, from the beginning to the end

788
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,380
I will be with you

789
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,380
I will be with you
