00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
Yeah.

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Director, I'm going out. You two.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, go ahead.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Give you five minutes to get ready. I'll get the machine.

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Xiao Zhou, can you untie this button?

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Did you read the script? Your image is so good.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Look at the character. This feeling must show your charm, right?

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Even two can be untied.

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
After untied, turn this collar out.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Look at the line. It's so attractive. You must show it.

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
When you dance later, you dance a little more lively, more charming, more seductive.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And when you're excited, you can even dance on the sofa.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You can dance freely. You can dance however you want.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll play some music for you to help you get into the plot.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Director, I'm not going to sleep.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't waste your time.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can go to Ghana or Venice.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You can go by yourself. Sorry.

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you mean?

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've got the machine. I'm going to try it. You're not going to try it.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Xiao Zhou, I'm telling you. Think about it.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're giving up your future.

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Get out of my way.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm better than you.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You see, I'm faster than you.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mommy

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Wait for me.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay, baby.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll be home in ten minutes.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, don't turn the big car.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You all follow me.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm getting on the bus.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Tiao Tiao

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Tiao Tiao, what's wrong with you?

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Tiao Tiao

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Put this on the left and the right.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Put this on the right.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is it the last year of the two years?

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is it the last year of the two years?

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't care.

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You still care about me.

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't care.

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I just want to see how beautiful this beauty is.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Can't I?

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't care at all.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay?

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll be there in a minute.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hello, Miss Sun.

55
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, no problem.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll be there in a minute.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Excuse me, Miss Sun.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What kind of role is it?

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh.

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, okay, okay.

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay, bye.

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Ms. Luo,

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
would you like to go to the next room with us

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and have some beer?

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm busy.

70
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm busy with the celebration.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Forget it.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I...

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you in a rush to go home?

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm not going.

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell Jiang

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to buy him a drink some other day.

77
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay.

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're in a rush to go home?

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Aren't you

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
in a rush?

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not in a rush.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You look like

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
a real screenwriter.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Would you like to eat something later?

85
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Did you like the movie?

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You looked so serious

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
when you were doing the handwriting.

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you looking at me?

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't you want me to look at you?

90
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hello?

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hello, Xixi?

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's wrong?

93
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't cry.

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What's wrong with Tiao Tiao?

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tiao Tiao is in trouble.

96
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll be there in a minute.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey, you're here.

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's wrong with you?

99
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What's wrong with you?

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you okay?

101
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't be afraid.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's nothing.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's just a kid.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's normal to be so harsh.

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't cry.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Of course I know that

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
it's not a big deal.

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Chen Ming will not care about it.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Xixi, what are you talking about?

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't hear you clearly.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He will definitely say

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that you're so many people

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and your kid can't even cry.

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He will definitely blame me.

115
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's okay.

116
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't cry.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wipe your tears.

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll be there soon.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll figure something out when I get there.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't worry.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How long is it left?

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
5 kilometers left.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's almost there.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's so late.

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll have to trouble you to go.

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's okay.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The road is good now.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There are fewer cars.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a bit windy.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This friend of yours

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
is your college classmate, right?

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard from you before

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that he got married not long after graduation.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
His husband started his own business.

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It seems that the company is quite big.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why don't you ask for more money

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
from families like theirs

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and find a better private hospital

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
around your house

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and run to the airport?

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Maybe it's convenient.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That hospital has relatives from their family.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's close to the airport.

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's convenient.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Your husband is quite good.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is your friend

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
fully at home taking care of the child?

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Fully.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Fully.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Fully at home.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And you brought the child like this.

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm so sorry.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You brought the child

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
like this.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Have you brought the child?

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No.

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Then it's not appropriate

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to say that.

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can't hear others

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
saying that about my sister.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's my bad.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's my bad.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
a weak woman like her

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
has taken care of

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
such a big family

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
so clearly.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And she has a child.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
She has a child.

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Her husband doesn't care about her.

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's the only one who cares.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And you didn't see that child.

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She's beautiful,

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and she's well-developed.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She's very cute.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Besides,

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
it's normal for a little boy

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to have a hard time

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
with a broken bone.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not that serious.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's not serious.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's not serious.

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's normal for a little boy

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
to have a hard time.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
When I was a kid,

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I liked playing basketball.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I even broke my arm.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Look,

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't even go back to school now.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Drive.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You don't have to wait for me.

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm staying at Xixi's today.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Mom Rong,

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
do you want to go to Mexico City?

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Mexico City?

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You forgot?

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I remember.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're taking me to Mexico City?

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

204
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's more expensive now than it was then.

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It must be tens of thousands.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why do you suddenly want to go to Mexico City?

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I admit that I was not sensible at that time.

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I missed the most important person,

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the most important thing.

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I only realized it at this age.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wu Hao.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't you think

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
it's not good to say this now?

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm going to Xixi.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wait for me.

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Luo Man,

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
don't rush to answer me.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can think about it again.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you don't want to go to Mexico City,

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you can go to other places.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You can tell me that I'll book a flight ticket right away.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's just go.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Is it the clinic?

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
To the right of the door?

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll be there in a minute.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't worry.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm in a hurry.

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What's wrong?

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Everyone in the plane is in a hurry.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
No.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've picked up the stuff for you.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've paid you.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think it's not appropriate for you to be here.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What are you doing?

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm going to check the road again.

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I almost hit someone again.

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Xiao Nianqing is so fierce.

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm so angry.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Xixi.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's okay. I'm here.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go home and talk.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Little girl.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You hit your head.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Does it hurt?

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It hurts a little.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Are you sleepy?

252
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sleepy.

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're a little man.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's go home and sleep, okay?

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Wait a minute.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where's Fang Chi?

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Fang Chi? Who?

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He's Chen Ming's cousin.

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's in the clinic.

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's here.

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Fang Chi.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Here are the pills and the medical records.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There are electronic boards on the computer now.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But just in case,

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you'd better wear them all when you get your checkup.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay.

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The rest are some oral anti-inflammatory drugs.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you.

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Tiao Tiao.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can't be so reckless now.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
When you play with your friends,

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
you must be careful not to touch these arms.

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Did you hear what Uncle Shui said?

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Tiao Tiao is so good.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
When you have a high fever,

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll take you to the amusement park.

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mommy.

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Can I take Wang Zuhan with me?

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's already treated you like this.

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Why do you still take him?

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He apologized to me.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We're good friends.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Good boy.

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Wang Chi, thank you.

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, I forgot to introduce you.

286
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is...

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This...

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This is my best friend, Luo Man.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He's a great writer.

290
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, no.

291
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He's not as good as a doctor.

292
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He's very strict.

293
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He doesn't let people make mistakes.

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He's good.

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Kids are the best.

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Kids are the most polite.

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's go back.

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Are you sleepy?

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's go.

300
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We'll go first.

301
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Go to the door and change.

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Go to the VIP room and search for your favorite clothes.

303
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Buy three.

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:16,620
The

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What happened today that scared you so much?

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Last afternoon,

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Tiao-Tiao said she wanted to play with the toy car.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Actually, auntie is cooking.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I went to the neighborhood with her alone.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I really...

311
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I just turned around for an hour.

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
When I looked up,

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
she was gone.

314
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
A child happened to be on the slope

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and came down from the skateboarding.

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I hit her.

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's it?

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Then you...

319
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You just make up a reason.

320
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You said that you were not keeping your mind.

321
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Tiao-Tiao insisted on playing that skateboard.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Then she hit it and fell.

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Isn't that enough?

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I can't hide it.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Tiao-Tiao's music teacher saw it.

326
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What a coincidence.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She came to help Tiao-Tiao in class at this time.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
English is good.

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Just let her shut up.

330
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's it.

331
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you can't do it, give her some gifts.

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's a bad thing.

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's like a comedy.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
As for it,

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you're too introverted.

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's useless.

337
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't know.

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not sure about

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
her relationship with Chen Mian.

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But I have to think of a way

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
before Chen Mian comes home.

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't believe that fake.

343
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You mean Chen Mian and the fake...

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know.

345
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Chen Mian,

346
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm here.

347
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Come on, tell me.

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
When will Chen Mian come home?

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He came back from abroad today.

350
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He landed at 11.40.

351
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
He's still on the plane.

352
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Are you sure?

353
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes.

354
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I bought him a ride.

355
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Okay.

356
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's 11.18 now.

357
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There are 22 steps to Chen Mian.

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Let's use this time

359
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
to think of a way

360
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to get that family.

361
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What can you do with this time?

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Didn't you say I'm a great writer?

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You made up this crap

364
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
within my scope.

365
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You said I always think I'm right

366
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and made everyone into my script.

367
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll make it up to you today

368
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and show you.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Wait.

370
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
First question.

371
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why do you suspect

372
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
they have something?

373
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm not boasting.

374
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I just want to know

375
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
the background of the characters.

376
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There are five family members in total.

377
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Only in English class,

378
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Chen Mian is there.

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And he goes in every time.

380
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He's very concerned.

381
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What else?

382
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He comes very early every time.

383
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Other family members arrive at 7 o'clock.

384
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He usually arrives at 5 o'clock.

385
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But he says he's afraid of being late.

386
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Who knows?

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Maybe he's here too early.

388
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's why he's here.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Here's the key question.

390
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you think they have

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
an unusual relationship?

392
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Is it before or after class?

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is a key question.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If they had a relationship before,

395
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
it means that this family

396
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
was arranged by Chen Mian.

397
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He said it was a big deal.

398
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
After class?

399
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It should be after.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This family was

401
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
interviewed by Chen Mian's assistant and me.

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Chen Mian didn't participate in the whole process.

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
He was still a student at that time.

404
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't think Chen Mian's assistant

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
would have cheated him.

406
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's easy.

407
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Chen Caixi, remember this.

408
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You did nothing wrong today.

409
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm here to help you with this.

410
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm not here to help you get out of the way.

411
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're not guilty.

412
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We just want to clear up

413
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
these messy people

414
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and messy things.

415
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do you understand?

416
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Do as I say.

417
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Your family will definitely accuse you of blackmail.

418
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So you have to take the first step.

419
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
First, call Chen Mian

420
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and tell him that Tiotiao is injured.

421
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Tell him to go home.

422
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hurry up.

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Second, you have to adjust yourself.

424
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Remember, you're not Chen Mian's Chen Caixi.

425
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're Chen Caixi who wants to get out of this.

426
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Do you understand?

427
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Pull yourself out.

428
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Pull yourself out.

429
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Take a deep breath.

430
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
More guilt.

431
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
More mercy.

432
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
More grievance.

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Enjoy.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Last step.

435
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Go upstairs and wake Tiotiao up.

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Tiotiao is injured?

437
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes.

438
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So you have to wake him up.

439
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Tell him to tell Chen Mian

440
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
that he accidentally fell down.

441
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Fortunately, there's a family to help.

442
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You mean...

443
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yes.

444
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's what I mean.

445
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No.

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Don't get Tiotiao in here.

447
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This is my bottom line.

448
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay.

449
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Then you wait for Tiotiao to call his mother.

450
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You don't have time.

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Chen Mian is almost home.

452
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Tiotiao, wake up.

453
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Your mom said something to you.

454
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Mommy.

455
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
How could this happen?

456
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Mommy.

457
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Mommy.

458
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Mommy.

459
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mommy.

460
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Mommy.

461
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's all we can do.

462
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Tiotiao is smart.

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Just say a few words and he'll understand.

464
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Come on.

465
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Tiotiao is asleep.

466
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's okay.

467
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'll go in and check.

468
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll go in and check.

469
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Daddy.

470
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Daddy.

471
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm worried about you.

472
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Does your hand hurt?

473
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No.

474
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm a little boy.

475
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You're a real boy.

476
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Your mom told me

477
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
that your voice is hoarse.

478
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I saw the prince was still hiding.

479
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But I couldn't stop.

480
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I know.

481
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Because of the relationship,

482
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I couldn't stop.

483
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Your mom told me

484
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
that when she turned around

485
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and looked back,

486
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
you were gone.

487
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Your mom is

488
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
a little careless.

489
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
She's a little immature.

490
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You should be careful

491
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
when you're playing.

492
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Daddy.

493
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Thank you for your help today.

494
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I was on the street.

495
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
She saw me

496
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and told me

497
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
that you should help me thank her.

498
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's what she should do.

499
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Son.

500
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Do you like Amy?

501
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes.

502
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
She's very nice to me.

503
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Really?

504
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
How nice?

505
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Amy comes to my class

506
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
very early.

507
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
She plays with me,

508
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
plays with me on TV,

509
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
cares about me,

510
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and cares about

511
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
mommy and daddy.

512
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
She said

513
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
if auntie is not home,

514
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
she can come to me

515
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and take me home.

516
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
By the way,

517
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
she also asks me

518
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
what I like to eat

519
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and what I like to exercise.

520
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Anything else?

521
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
She always

522
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
brings me chocolate.

523
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Mommy only gives me

524
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
one piece a week.

525
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Amy always comes

526
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and brings me some secretly.

527
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Little rabbit.

528
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You're not allowed to eat chocolate.

529
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's painful to eat it.

530
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Understand?

531
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Eat, son.

532
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Son.

533
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Good night.

534
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Good night, daddy.

535
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Why are you still here?

536
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You've been working all night.

537
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Go to sleep.

538
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's okay.

539
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's okay.

540
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You're a boy.

541
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You're like me.

542
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I was hurt every day when I was a kid.

543
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't grow up so much.

544
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Honey.

545
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's good that you're back.

546
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm glad you're back.

547
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm glad you're back.

548
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I feel relieved.

549
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm here.

550
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's okay.

551
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Honey.

552
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I...

553
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I have one more game tonight.

554
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
They're all waiting for me.

555
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'll count it.

556
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay.

557
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Honey.

558
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Remember to eat this before drinking.

559
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's not dry.

560
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't drink too much.

561
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Good girl.

562
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'll be back early.

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Honey.

564
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I made a bottle of wine.

565
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's a reward for your hard work.

566
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Get some side dishes.

567
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
What's wrong with her?

568
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
She's a hard worker.

569
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll be right back.

570
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh.

571
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You're so sweet.

572
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You're so sweet.

573
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Shouldn't you bring a 5G hot dog with ham?

574
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Eat.

575
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What did Tiu Tiu tell you?

576
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
She didn't say anything.

577
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
She just told me that she loves me.

578
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
When I went in,

579
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I didn't tell her anything.

580
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I just wanted to tell her that I love you.

581
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I can't say it.

584
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You're still so young.

585
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You told her to help me get rid of my rival.

586
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't think that's how a mother should be.

587
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Is it possible that you don't have to say a lot of things?

588
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Children actually understand.

589
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Maybe she's more sensitive than normal children.

590
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
She's more sensible.

591
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What's wrong?

592
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
She wasn't as sensible and sensitive as she was back then.

593
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
She was just like a normal child.

594
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I didn't expect that.

595
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
She really understands everything now.

596
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
A normal child?

597
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Do you think that a normal child can have a happy ending in a room?

598
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And a father who lets her lie down?

599
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
She has both good and bad.

600
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Do you know that?

601
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Chen Mei used to

602
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
do so many things.

603
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But I really never hated her.

604
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I suddenly feel that

605
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
she's becoming my enemy little by little.

606
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
She's becoming my enemy little by little.

607
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Thank you.

608
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I really think

609
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it's lucky that you understand all these things now.

610
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
A lot of people might just pass away like this for the rest of their lives.

611
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
They've been living their lives in self-esteem.

612
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Sometimes I feel like I'm really ridiculous.

613
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm like a fireman.

614
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Today I destroyed a little shell.

615
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Tomorrow I'll come back to Amy.

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I destroyed Amy.

617
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Tomorrow I'll come back to all kinds of morning.

618
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
When will I be a head?

619
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What's so bad about this?

620
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you think that everyone will not know if I don't say it?

621
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Who doesn't know?

622
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Right?

623
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You have to ask me.

624
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I believe that they are fine.

625
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The little girl is quite a high-spirited person.

626
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
As long as she's not an enemy, I can treat her as a friend.

627
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
As long as she's not an enemy, I can treat her as a friend.

628
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You might not believe it.

629
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I still like her a little.

630
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Look.

631
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Listen to me.

632
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
When you're in a very low mood, don't get involved in these messy things.

633
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Do you think I'm like this?

634
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Sometimes you'll think I'm really stupid.

635
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Not stupid.

636
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's naive.

637
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
At our age, we can still be naive.

638
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's precious.

639
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm not stupid.

640
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm not stupid.

641
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Do you know?

642
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's true.

643
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The wives I know are very clear.

644
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
As long as they have a husband, a child, and money,

645
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
it doesn't matter what else they have.

646
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It doesn't matter if you play with me or not.

647
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm not stupid.

648
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm not stupid.

649
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm not stupid.

650
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It doesn't matter if you play with me or not.

651
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
We're so cool.

652
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Heart.

653
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So what if I die?

654
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Not like me.

655
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You can't compare yourself to those women.

656
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You're different from them.

657
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You're different from them.

658
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Because you married Ai Qing.

659
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You followed Chen Min because of Ai Qing.

660
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Are you stupid?

661
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm not stupid.

662
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm not stupid.

663
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Which side should I sleep on?

664
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I don't want to sleep on Chen Min's side.

665
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'll sleep on that side.

666
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But it doesn't matter which side.

667
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The auntie changes the bed sheets every week.

668
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Chen Min hasn't slept at home for half a month.

669
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Do you want to try this mask?

670
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's expensive, but it's useful.

671
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Look at my face.

672
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Is it useful?

673
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let me see.

674
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay, it's fine.

675
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm afraid I can't see it.

676
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Right?

677
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's good to kneel.

678
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Almost there.

679
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's still a little bit stuffy.

680
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I know.

681
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Do you think we can be like this in the future?

682
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Impossible.

683
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You don't eat main food for dinner.

684
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I run the playground every day.

685
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
How can I be like that?

686
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But you may have to work harder.

687
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Luo Ma.

688
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Luo Ma.

689
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Now I know

690
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
it's all the arrogance of a girl.

691
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's so sad.

692
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You're young and beautiful.

693
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You think all the ugly things in the world

694
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
are because you don't work hard.

695
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's so sad.

696
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Forget it.

697
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No matter what mask you use,

698
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
it won't go back to the past.

699
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Our past and our youth

700
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
are not wasted.

701
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Now it's so good.

702
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You are rich and elegant.

703
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I am independent.

704
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I don't want to go back to that

705
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
bitter and bloody days.

706
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I've had enough.

707
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Do you still roll your quilt when you sleep?

708
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I used to sleep with you.

709
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I have to be woken up at midnight.

710
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You still have to sleep with me.

711
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You like to talk in your dreams.

712
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You can also brush your teeth.

713
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You scared me at midnight.

714
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's great.

715
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We can sleep together again.

716
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You're so nice.

717
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm sorry.

722
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm sorry.

724
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm sorry.

725
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm sorry.

726
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm sorry.

727
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm sorry.

729
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm sorry.

730
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm sorry.

731
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm sorry.

732
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry.

733
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm sorry.

734
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm sorry.

739
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm sorry.

740
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm sorry.

741
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm sorry.

746
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm sorry.

747
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm sorry.

748
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
