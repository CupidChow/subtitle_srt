Come on, guys, get ready

Feel the music

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Breathe in and out, feel the floor

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Music

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hello, Kai Qi

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why isn't Luo Man here?

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Did she say she would come?

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I saw her asking you where you were going to class yesterday

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I thought she would come

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She was just saying

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She's so early, how could she come?

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Try this, it's really popular lately

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I saw a lot of celebrities and celebrities sitting around

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How are things between you and Zhong Zun?

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Did he contact you?

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There are too many people today, I can't take care of them

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll treat you to a meal next time

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I love you

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The play is already like this, who doesn't understand who's thinking?

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And now you're sending this kind of message

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's so funny to have a piece of cake early in the morning

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I didn't contact her

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe I'm not her type

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think she likes Luo Man more

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How could you be everyone's type?

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Boss Zhou is in good terms

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Her ex-wife is in good terms too

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Although Luo Man is my best friend, you know that

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not her type

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Although Luo Man is my best friend, you know that

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We all say that we shouldn't use women's age and appearance to measure their values

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But who doesn't have a sense of sense?

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Luo Man is already very good to ordinary men

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But I think she can't get rid of Zhou Mosheng

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Even Luo Man can't get rid of her, I can't either

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm not much younger than Luo Man

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm still a little bit young

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're 25 years old, you're in your prime

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If you're too young, men won't think about you

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where's Mrs. Chen? She hasn't come out yet?

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's wrong?

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Someone called Mrs. Chen, I thought they were calling me

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your husband's name is Chen too?

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, my husband's name is Chen Mian

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you know him?

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry, I don't know the company

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's okay, it's a small company, you don't know them well

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you want to go up and play?

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, I can only make instant noodles

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Instant noodles?

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't remember what instant noodles taste like

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Every day I think about how many cards I have to play

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't stand it, let's see what I can do

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, these two are too demanding

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're too stingy

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is the first time I've seen someone make double cups at home

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So amazing

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I like to make these

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I've always thought that the happiest flavor in the world is the taste of home cooked food

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Your husband is really lucky, he's so nice

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He doesn't think so

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He always complains to me, he says you have to help me do this and keep my figure

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you want?

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think he's stressed

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I've never seen a perfect woman like you

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She's beautiful, generous, gentle, she can cook, she can cook

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How amazing is that?

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're good at talking

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It smells good

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you Mr. Zhou?

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I just said he was interested in you

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
My roommate

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He forgot to bring the key, he wants me to open the door for him

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll ask the driver to send you there

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No need, I'll just take a taxi

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you, Sister Kaixi

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're welcome

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Then we'll meet again later

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll open the door for him

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, see you

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
See you

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm leaving, bye bye

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why are you here?

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm so bored

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is my roommate

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's generous and generous

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He's like Zhou Musun

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He's so particular

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's not delicate, he's willing to spend money on himself

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's so generous

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He's so generous

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He's so generous

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He's not delicate, he's willing to spend money on himself

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm so familiar with this kind of man

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Chengcheng

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Chengcheng

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Be good

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll bring you something to eat

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm afraid it's this kind of man

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That night, my father followed a woman

126
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He didn't come back

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mom

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Do you remember what I said?

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Women

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Have to rely on themselves

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hello, new friends

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hello

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What do you want to perform?

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Perform...

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What can I perform here?

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How about I tell you a joke?

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay?

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll think of something funny

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I have an idea

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I used to be a good singer

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I used to have a hard-working Zhu Guoli

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He called himself Zhu Guoli Bang

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Every time he encouraged himself

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He would say Zhu Guoli Bang Bang Bang

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's not funny, right?

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll think of another one

148
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's this?

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So many

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Thank you, brother

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Brother hasn't stopped

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thank him

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you, brother

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's your name?

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Wind chaser

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Wind chaser

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Thank you, wind chaser

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll see you

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you

160
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I want to see you now

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wind chaser

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sit down

163
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hello

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You scared me

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You chose a good place

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I passed by the bun shop

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I bought three buns

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you want some?

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, thanks

170
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You are...

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Wind chaser

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Wind chaser

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What's this?

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Beef and scallion

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If it's with chives, it's better

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's my taste

178
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Xia

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sorry

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We don't serve outside

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We have everything you want

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll go to the place you chose

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How far is it?

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Upstairs

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't believe it

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Show me your phone

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is it connected to your wifi?

188
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Then...

189
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Have some water

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
With ice

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can eat buns

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Brother, how about you order an hour?

193
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's okay

194
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you want anything?

195
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Brother

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Brother, come

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't want to waste food

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'll order a bun with rice and a bun with fries

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But you can tell the chef not to cook

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll eat my buns

202
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Is that okay?

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think it's good

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's it

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't call me brother anymore

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, brother

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll order it right away

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're not kidding

214
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you do?

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's nothing

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
My roommate and I

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We started our own business

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We used a social media app

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We were lucky

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And we got the promotion

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We got it right

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But then

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I became the manager

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
In my daily life

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I listen to other people's reports

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I fool others

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was so bored

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought you guys

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Would eat fish and salad

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
With black coffee

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Rich people are not fools

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes

235
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll answer the phone

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Please

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Go ahead

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay

239
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, I got it

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There's a media interview tomorrow

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I confirmed some details

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Actually

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I hate this kind of thing

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You have an interview every day

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's arranged by PR

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I think

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's stupid

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm not a celebrity

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why do you interview me?

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
My users don't buy my products

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because they like me

253
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Those companies that like to show off

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Usually have problems in the present

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The most comfortable thing in the world is

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
To avoid those fools

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And make money without thinking

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then spend it

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's great, right?

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I think

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The whole process is boring

265
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But there's one thing

266
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I think it's interesting

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This reporter came from abroad

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I asked my assistant to book him a hotel

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
A five-star hotel

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You know

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's not worth much

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
After he finished

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He can play for a few days

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Have a nice weekend

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I think this is interesting

276
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes

277
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't talk about me

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You do it

279
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Me?

280
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You do it

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm just a ten-line actress

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's hard, right?

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Okay

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why not?

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm talking about you

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The director is looking for you

287
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Sorry

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're waiting for him, right?

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Hurry up

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Sorry

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sit down

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Sorry, I'm sorry

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry

294
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hurry up

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hurry up

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Camera

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Camera, one, two, three, four

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Camera

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Hold on

301
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Hurry up, the patient is getting faster

302
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Camera

303
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Hold on

304
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
One, two, three, four

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
One, two, three, four

306
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
One, two, three, four

307
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
One, two, three, four

308
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Just like you watched my live show

309
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
My friend was too poor to watch it

310
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So she was lazy to watch it for me

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But I don't plan to do that for a long time

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're so boring every day

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, I'm boring

314
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What do you think is interesting?

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You want to hear this?

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You guys shouldn't be interested in these things

317
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because you're pretty

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hurry up

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay

320
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I majored in acting

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But you don't have to check my acting

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You won't find me if you do

323
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Our industry is too particular about resources, connections and luck

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But I don't have any of these

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Many actors and actresses are now live-streaming

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They come fast and easily

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I don't understand them

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I like acting

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
When I turn on the camera, the camera is facing me

331
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I feel like I can become that character

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And you know, every time I have an interview opportunity

333
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't sleep at night

334
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I feel like I'm usually lost

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But as soon as I start acting, I come back to life

336
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I become a living person

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Go on

338
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
People say that coming to the big city is for dreams

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But I feel that many people are now mixed

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And they become living for their lives

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't think so

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But sometimes when I take the subway

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I also doubted

344
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What's the point of living like this?

345
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But it's different when I go to the subway station

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There will always be a number of suns in front of me

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's like the stage light

348
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The kind that is especially for me

349
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I feel like I'm in the right city

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There must be something waiting for me

351
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I feel like I'm in the right city

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There must be something waiting for me

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I feel like I'm in the right city

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't you think I'm a little unrealistic?

355
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
For your dream

356
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm going to the bathroom

357
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay, I'll take you up

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Am I the first person who didn't go to your room to drink water and play cards?

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't get me wrong

360
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
In three and a half years, I have to watch the play of AC Milan

361
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If I go to your room to watch TV

362
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Does it seem that I have no interest?

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay, let's go

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What?

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I think you have no time

366
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
People live on an impulse

367
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I came to see you today also on this impulse

368
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But I didn't expect it to be the happiest day of my year

369
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Where are you? I'm in the bamboo forest

370
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm almost there

371
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Where are you?

372
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I had a video conference this afternoon

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's too boring

374
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sleepy

375
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm going to sleep

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to sleep

377
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to sleep

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm going to sleep

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm going to sleep

380
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm going to sleep

381
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm going to sleep

382
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm going to sleep

383
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm going to sleep

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going to sleep

385
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Come on

386
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay

387
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm going to sleep

388
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm going to sleep

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm going to sleep

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm going to sleep

391
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Hello

392
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
How are you now? I'm in the car

393
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Don't worry

394
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The more it is, the more you have to hold on

395
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I know

396
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Tell me if you need anything

397
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Tell me right away

398
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Maybe a little bit later

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Sorry

400
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm writing a script

401
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Tell me when you leave

402
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There are still many highlights in this project

403
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The problem now is that the valuation is too high

404
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The last part is over

405
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
No hurry

406
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You do your work

407
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No hurry

408
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What do you want to eat tonight?

409
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay

410
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm going to sleep

411
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Are you sure you want to come?

412
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What?

413
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Hello

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Did you come down?

415
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No

416
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What is it? I'm so worried

417
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I... I... I...

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I want to say

419
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Is this situation really going to go up?

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Did you think about it before...

421
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You mean

422
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm not going first

423
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm not going to sleep

424
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No, no

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
How about this

426
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You come over quickly

427
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll wait for you in the lobby

428
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay

429
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Hello

430
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The number you have dialed is not available

431
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
How long will it take?

432
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Almost there

433
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
There are still a few lights

434
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm going to sleep

435
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm going to sleep

436
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm coming

437
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You're here

438
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Come in

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Your sofa looks comfortable

440
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Why are you nervous?

441
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll knock you down on the bed in a second

442
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What would you like to drink?

443
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Coke

444
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll have sugar free

445
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We all drink coke

446
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What's the difference between sugar free and sugar free?

447
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This sugar free coke

448
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Sounds like a man's mouth

449
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I love you

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You talk like a little fart in our hometown

451
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I've been like this since I was a kid

452
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I can't change it

453
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't wear a big one either

454
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Why do you want to live in a hotel?

455
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Convenient

456
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's okay to go anywhere

457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I mean, why don't you just buy a house or rent a house?

458
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Chen Xiaoting

459
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I think this reason is stupid

460
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
When I was a kid

461
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I saw a social news

462
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
How Jiang Yi's brother was so popular

463
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
How did it shine?

464
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It was particularly impressive to me

465
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The reporter said

466
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This big brother has been living in five-star hotels for four seasons

467
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I thought in my heart at that time

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This is the life of my dream

469
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Later, the conditions were allowed

470
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I went to live in a hotel

471
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Of course there is another more important reason

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Look

473
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Just over there

474
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Did you see the long-term store?

475
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That is the most delicious bun shop in the city

476
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Bun again

477
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Good for you

478
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Why did you call me here?

479
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Aren't you sleepy?

480
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Jincheng

481
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I want to talk to you

482
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You say

483
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Let's be good

484
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Is it like this?

485
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I never lack a woman who comes upstairs

486
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
There must be a man who wants to take you back to the room

487
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We both understand

488
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I asked you to come at four o'clock in the afternoon

489
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Why are we here?

490
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Life is short

491
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't want to be rash anymore

492
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I am not entangled

493
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Is it love me or love my money?

494
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What kind of stupid cat am I?

495
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I think money is my home and my home

496
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Which part do you love me?

497
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You love me

498
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Am I right?

499
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
How long have they been up?

500
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
At most fifteen minutes

501
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I am sorry

502
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Why are you here?

503
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Zhou Muxen asked me out for dinner

504
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It doesn't matter

505
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Have you made up your mind?

506
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
If you go up, there is no way back

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Don't worry

508
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I didn't want to go up and make trouble

509
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I just want to knock on the mountain and the tiger

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Make a joke

511
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Think about it

512
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I don't want to make a fool of myself before the end

513
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I am not stupid

514
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
If we get along, I will do my best to help you

515
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
No matter in economy or business

516
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And you don't have to be stressed

517
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's just a man's ability to do what he likes

518
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Especially when I have a family

519
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I can't live without it

520
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You are married?

521
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I am thirty-six years old

522
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I am a year older than you

523
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I didn't see you bring your wedding ring

524
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You mean this?

525
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I went out to play

526
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I kept taking it off

527
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But I really lost it

528
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Qingcheng

529
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I am not a shameless person

530
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
You can still declare that you are single outside

531
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I will never interfere with your choice

532
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
If one day you meet your true love

533
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I will never stop you

534
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But if you never see it

535
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And you are willing to stay with me

536
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I will make you feel that everything you do is too late

537
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Is it that hard to decide?

538
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Hello, the phone is ringing

539
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The phone

540
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You don't answer the phone

541
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Hello

542
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Hello, where are you?

543
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I am at the office

544
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Hello

545
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Hello, where are you?

546
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I helped you get your suit

547
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I am in a meeting

548
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Can you not call me during work hours?

549
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You are too busy

550
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There is no time to work

551
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Don't bring it back

552
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Give it to Tiao Tiao

553
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Luo Man said he saw you talking to someone in the lobby

554
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I am in the lobby

555
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I didn't see you

556
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay

557
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wait a minute

558
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I will come down

559
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Hello

560
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Did you call the car?

561
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Is it that hard to decide?

562
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Hello, the phone is ringing

563
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The phone

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why are you laughing?

565
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Why are you laughing?

566
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You answer the phone first

567
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's not good not to answer the phone, right?

What you said was too sudden

569
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Give me some time
