um

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ooh, yeah

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ooh, ooh

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I see you two are getting along

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You've always wanted to ask, but you're too shy to ask

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's your relationship?

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't say anything about our relationship

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's the point of saying nothing?

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What's the point of saying something?

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Right, Qingcheng?

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mr. Ken, can you talk about the new project you just mentioned?

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm quite impressed

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm quite impressed

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm quite impressed

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm quite impressed

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm quite impressed

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can you talk about the new project you just mentioned?

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm quite impressed

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
New project?

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We'll have a lot of time to talk about it in the future

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mutsun, it's hard to say, so say it

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mingzhe, let Luo Man say it

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Isn't Luo Man a good talker? Say it

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It seems that in Chinese culture

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
there isn't a single word that can describe this kind of relationship

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're talking about Chinese culture

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
In my opinion, it's easy to define

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Isn't it?

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For example, a man and a woman

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They're both adults and they want to see each other

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But they're both very busy and very tired

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Actually, for men

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it's good to meet at home and chat on the sofa

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But for women, it seems not formal enough

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So they can only come to this kind of restaurant

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that has a lower price than the one in China

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and meet here

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What word can describe this kind of un-economic relationship?

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A pursuit

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It seems not so humble

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then it's a date

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A date?

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are we going on a date?

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to thank you

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want to thank you

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Actually, I want to thank you

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For what?

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
For what you said today

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I usually say bad things about you

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you want to see what you did before?

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm right

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Aren't we on a date?

60
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, a date

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I thought you would confirm this relationship

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
After all

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
After all, I'm a smart woman

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I won't do such a silly thing

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Smart women know that

66
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ms. Zhou has a habit

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
One step closer

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and push two steps

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to a Jiangtai Palace

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and stay there

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
waiting for the rain to come

72
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jiangtai Palace

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come

74
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you have a fever?

75
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's hot

76
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Get up and take some medicine

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Be good

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Come, let me put on some clothes

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Come, eat

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This hand

81
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Before taking the medicine

82
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
eat some cookies

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
or you may not be able to stand it

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come, take the medicine

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Drink some water first

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Eat

87
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Drink some water

88
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Drink some water

89
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Listen

90
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's not my fault

91
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The notice was issued yesterday

92
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It was in the afternoon

93
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It was just issued

94
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It was changed in the morning

95
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hurry up

96
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's so smelly

97
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The notice won't be seen

98
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and you're being pushed

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Jiajia, I'm talking about you

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's so smelly

101
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The teacher doesn't blame me

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yesterday, he said it was in the afternoon

103
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If it was a fake

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
you wouldn't have seen it

105
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're still wearing makeup?

106
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Zhong Qingcheng, is that your name?

107
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Sorry to keep you waiting

108
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're so annoying

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry

110
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, the little actress

111
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
is still trying to get her face back

112
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
She's so strong

113
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
She's so strong

114
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hold the candle

115
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's go and get the incense

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hurry up

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Did you offend someone?

119
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They're targeting you

120
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Director Xu

121
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Director Xu

122
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I've been meaning to tell you

123
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're the first one to take me into the industry

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You've always been my role model

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So no matter what happens...

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Stop

127
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What's wrong with you?

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Can you act?

129
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you have any sense of faith?

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Where did you find such an unprofessional woman?

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're so picky

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I've been so depressed

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You've ruined my mood

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You can't act anymore

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sister Na

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What's wrong?

137
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Director

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Who did you find?

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why are you so unprofessional?

140
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What kind of woman is she?

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
She can act with me?

142
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Look at her eyes

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you have any respect and admiration for me?

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How can you act without any sense of faith?

145
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sister Na, you're right

146
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
She's a newcomer

147
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Right?

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
She's not good at acting

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sister Na, calm down

150
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's take another shot

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay?

152
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry, Sister Na

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Give me another chance

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll try to act again later

155
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Right

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Sister Na, let's take another shot

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay?

158
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Director Xu

159
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Director Xu

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Director Xu

161
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I've been meaning to tell you

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're the first one to take me into the industry

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You've been...

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No, no

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Director Xu

166
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Director Xu

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I've been meaning to tell you

168
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can't shoot anymore

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, no

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What's wrong with you?

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Stop

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Sister Na, let's take another shot

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Pay attention to the end

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's a waste of time

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's take another shot

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry, Director Xu

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ready?

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Start

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Three, two, one, go!

180
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're the first one to take me into the industry

181
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You've always been my role model

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, no

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hold tight to the role

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hold tight

186
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Can you act?

188
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Who's looking for an actor?

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're not professional

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can't shoot anymore

191
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What do you mean I'm not professional?

192
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Remember to show some mercy later

193
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is that woman Luo Man?

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
She and Zhou...

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They say Luo Man's face is like a fire

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
How can it be?

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Look

198
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
This is a woman with means

199
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Director Fan is not here today

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll introduce you to a friend

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Mr. Song

202
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sorry, sorry

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm late

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's okay

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let me introduce you to Mr. Song from Qingzhou

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Song, I just saw you in the Nasdaq Bridge

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
on the financial news

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and you're back

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I just got back from the game

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I haven't lost any points

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I just wanted to play the big game

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and then go back to sleep

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not like when I was young

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's not easy to lose points now

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let me introduce you to Zheng Wuxun

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
from Wuxiao自北

218
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I always hear Chen Mian remind you

219
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that young people are good at everything

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Young people are good at everything

221
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Li, Mr. Song just came back from New York

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I just saw him on the circle of friends

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Song is usually a good at badminton

224
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mr. Zhou and I are old friends

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I thought we could practice with you today

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You have to show mercy later

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I admit, I admit

228
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Mr. Song, don't let him show mercy

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We're on the same side

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We'll beat them up and we'll never be a team

231
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Dr. Fang, did you hear that?

232
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Come on

234
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Come on

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Where's Tiao Tiao?

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why isn't she at home during the weekend?

237
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
She's going to do physical education

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I just want her to get some rest

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
so that she can sleep better than me

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
How's her hand?

241
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's almost healed

242
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I think it'll be better next month

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Then you can relax

244
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have something to tell you

245
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if I should say it or not

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But you said it's okay

247
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think I'm with Zhou

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is your reaction?

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Didn't you tell me he was a swindler?

250
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're a swindler too?

251
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What can I do?

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll hug you and cry

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't be together

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You can be with him

255
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But I think you shouldn't be too involved

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you still want to get married

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You're talking about the key to the problem

258
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm thinking

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
At our age

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's not easy to meet someone who loves you

261
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why do I have to follow the result?

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why can't I just enjoy a relationship?

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Besides, Zhou is really attractive

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He's the best of all my friends

265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then why don't I do it?

266
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Good shot

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Happy birthday

268
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Happy birthday

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm convinced

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You two are a good team

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Not bad

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're good too

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're good at the goalkeeper

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you talking about?

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm in the same team with Mr. Song

276
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's hard for you to not play for the goal

277
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I didn't even try to play well

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Mr. Song

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We're so in sync for the first time

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Just like I told you last night

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We'll be more in sync when we go to the school together

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's for sure

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Chen

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
How's your Kaixi?

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Is she used to work?

286
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It must be hard

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It must be more tiring than raising children at home

288
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Mainly, our company is a little bit away from their home

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But fortunately, there's a driver

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So it's not much different

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Right?

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I didn't know about this

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I didn't tell you

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Right, when did our Chen Kaixi go to work?

295
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mr. Song

296
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Our company is just too idle

297
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And they don't discuss with me when making many decisions

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Mr. Song, you know

299
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That woman

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Happy

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The meeting between the group and the cow

302
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Gives the new Chinese style a new look

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Put on the gentle pink

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And put it in the flower garden

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They are all good brands

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
For you who love each other

307
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Go to Weipin

308
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And buy the clothes you love

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I know what you're going to say

310
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Silence is the cost

311
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Time is the cost

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But the key is

313
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There's no time to meet better people

314
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And there's no one better

315
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Right?

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Besides

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's just a user experience

318
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't tell me about the experience

319
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Too much information, okay?

320
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No, listen to me

321
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't want to listen

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No, I don't want to tell you this

323
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Who wants to listen?

324
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Who do you want to tell?

325
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, okay, stop it

326
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I have something to tell you

327
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's also about

328
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Why are you back so suddenly?

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
President Chen

330
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What's wrong?

331
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Are you thinking about

332
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's not good for us

333
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If we are together

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You talk to me

335
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What's wrong?

336
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What's wrong?

337
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Did you have a fight again?

338
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sorry

339
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What's wrong?

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What are you doing?

341
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What are you doing at home?

342
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Where are you going?

343
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You have to go to Zhou Muzun

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Don't you know what is a team?

345
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I tell you

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You are

347
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Wife

348
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't expect you to help me

349
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But I beg you

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't drag my leg

351
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Don't be a thorn in my foot

352
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't you know why I

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Pulled Song Qilong in

354
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I just want to

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Make Zhou Muzun far away

356
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't stand this

357
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's been a long time

358
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You are

359
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
OK

360
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
This is the only way

361
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
To play the piano

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know

363
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I went to his company to work

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Why did I pit you?

365
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't know

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What do you know?

367
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You didn't see

368
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Song Qilong's eyes just now

369
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He didn't say a word

370
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's like a mirror in my heart

371
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You go to Zhou Muzun

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What's the relationship between me and Zhou Muzun?

373
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What's the relationship between us?

374
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Can you hear me?

375
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I didn't think so much

376
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I just want to keep up with your rhythm

377
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Is this wrong?

378
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I want to ask you

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But you are too busy

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
OK

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know what you are hiding

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You are afraid that I will say you

383
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Say you have nothing to do

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You want to do something

385
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
To give me a surprise, right?

386
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What a surprise

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You are a chess piece

388
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
To play me

389
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You don't tell me anything

390
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
How can I know

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
There are so many complicated relationships between you

392
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What project do you do?

393
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Who is good with whom?

394
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How can I know?

395
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I really admire you

396
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes

397
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You introduced Luo Mai to Zhou Muzun, right?

398
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Just once

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Wife

400
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You are so smart

401
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
She was so careless

402
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And you

403
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You

404
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You are a pig

405
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You wash yourself clean

406
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And you send it to me, right?

407
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I don't understand

408
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Is there such a big charm in drinking at noon?

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You all brainwash, right?

410
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wife

411
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I am wrong

412
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I can't figure it out

413
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I will resign my job immediately

414
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't be angry, OK?

415
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
OK, OK, OK

416
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I shouldn't say so much

417
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I shouldn't scold you either

418
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But you should be more careful, OK?

419
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
OK

420
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
By the way

421
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Stay away from Luo Mai

422
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
She is Zhou Muzun's woman

423
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Come to my house later

424
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I will make you a lamb chop

425
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Come

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Don't scare me

427
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I will make you a lamb chop

428
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You have been working for Zhou Muzun for a week or two

429
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He told me that I was suitable for investment

430
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And he gave me a title VP

431
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And he helped me to find an assistant

432
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What VP?

433
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You think about it

434
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What investment company is Zhou Muzun?

435
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
How many people are going to invest in it?

436
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You

437
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How could he use a housewife who has never been to any class?

438
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Chen Mian said that, I don't care

439
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why do you say that about me?

440
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You all say that women should be independent

441
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't go to a man

442
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I finally made a step forward

443
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I am also brave

444
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes, yes

445
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We should be independent

446
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But it's not the way to be independent

447
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You are so sharp

448
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Why don't you think about it?

449
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Remember

450
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Everything will happen for sure

451
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Once it's not like the real thing

452
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's definitely not the real thing

453
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Do you think you and Boss Shuang are like the real thing?

454
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I just think

455
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You went to his office for such a big thing

456
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
At least you told me

457
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I wouldn't let you jump into such a big fire pit, right?

458
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You didn't tell me about your relationship with Boss Zhou at the first time

459
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes, I know

460
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
People don't want to be spilled cold water

461
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
For things they are not sure about

462
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You didn't tell me about your relationship

463
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because you are afraid that I will spill cold water on you

464
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The same thing happened to my work

465
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I told you several times

466
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I want to go out and find something to do

467
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You just gave me a reward

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Didn't you just say

469
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Who would want a housewife who has never been to class

470
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
In your eyes, I am like this

471
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I saw you to death

472
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I feel sorry for you

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't want to see you being scolded by Chen Mian like this

474
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I don't need you to worry

475
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I won't lose the responsibility of Zhou Muzhun anyway

476
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
You should worry about yourself

477
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
OK, I will go by myself

478
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I will go by myself

479
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Come in

480
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Coming

481
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Coming

482
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Chen Kaixi went to work at your place

483
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Didn't she tell you?

485
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I thought you had such a good relationship

486
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
She would tell you

487
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Don't confuse the concepts

488
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Whether she said it or not is her business

489
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Do you know how miserable you made Chen Kaixi

491
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Do you know what Chen Mian scolded him like today?

492
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Chen Mian?

493
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Have you ever thought about others?

494
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Why would Chen Mian scold him?

495
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I didn't expect Chen Mian to scold him

496
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
There are many things you didn't expect

497
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I didn't expect that

498
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
These things are all about work

499
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I didn't invite you to talk about this

500
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I am in a good mood today

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I prepared wine and dishes

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
If you can calm down your emotions

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We can still have a good night

504
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
OK?

505
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No, I can't calm down

506
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't want to have this night

507
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't want to have this night

508
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Zhou Muesun, you don't have to be so shameless

509
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You don't think you can make my sister so miserable

510
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I can stand here without any reason

511
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
To play with you

512
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What are you thinking?

513
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You came into this room

514
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I hope there is only me and you in this house

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I won't bring any work to home

516
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I hope you won't

517
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Don't you think you are a little too much?

518
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Too much?

519
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
What is too much?

520
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What is it?

521
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's not just too much, it's too much reaction

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's not a big deal

523
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
They are still husband and wife after the quarrel

524
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Even if Chen Mian and I can't do this business

525
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
We will still be friends

526
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's normal to have a quarrel

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
What about me?

528
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Have you ever thought about me?

529
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Even a little bit

530
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Have you ever thought about my situation in this matter?

531
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If you don't put yourself in an awkward position

532
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You won't be embarrassed

533
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This matter is about me and Chen Mian

534
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It has nothing to do with you

535
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I see

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I am too selfish

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I take myself too seriously

538
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You are right

539
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I am too selfish

540
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But Mr. Zhou

541
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
When you step on others

542
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Can you have a little bit of bottom line?

543
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Bottom line?

544
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes, bottom line

545
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
A strange word

546
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Because you don't have it

547
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
After all, you are a person with flaws

548
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
A hard-working person

549
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Bottom line

550
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
This is my bottom line

551
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I am too selfish

552
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Mr. Zhou

553
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Don't worry

554
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I won't cross the line again

555
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
From now on

556
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I will never step into your field

557
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Okay?

558
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I will never step into your field

559
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Miss, please wait outside

560
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Hello, Miss

561
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Please don't block the door, thank you

562
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Your favorite chubby meat

563
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Is dad going home today?

564
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes

565
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Yes, dad has work to do

566
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So he went out again

567
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The wine is worse than you

568
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Do you know how to play the role?

569
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yes

570
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I am sorry

571
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's like this

572
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We feel that the heroine is an independent person

573
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Such an obvious fraud

574
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
She shouldn't be able to see that she was fooled

575
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You are usually so quiet

576
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Why don't you think about it?

577
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Remember

578
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Anything happens, there must be a reason

579
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Once this thing is not like the real thing

580
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's definitely not true

581
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Do you think you and Mr. Zhou are like the real thing?

582
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yes

583
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yes, Miss Ning

584
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I think you are right

585
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But I think

586
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
People are very complicated

587
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I think

588
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
On the one hand, she is smart

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But on the other hand, she is easy to be stupid

590
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Right?

591
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Especially if the heroine is very concerned

592
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
She is easy to be stupid

593
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Is it possible that she is stupid because she cares too much?

594
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
No, at least the first five episodes are not good

595
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The audience has a very poor perception of the heroine

596
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
The feeling of the heroine is too bad

597
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Ok

598
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We will remember it, Miss Ning

599
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Take a break

600
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Take a break

601
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You can eat whatever you want

602
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Ok

603
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Let's go

604
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Ha ha ha ha

605
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So funny

606
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
How are you these days?

607
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I quarreled with Zhou Musun

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Actually, it has nothing to do with you

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I just think his three views are really

610
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I think it's so funny

611
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I come

612
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Coming

613
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Thank you

614
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Sister Wan, there is a message for you

615
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Message?

616
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Ok

617
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Thank you

618
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Dear, eat something sweet

619
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Good things will happen

620
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Happy

621
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Happy

622
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Dear Luo Man

623
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Go to the place you want to go

624
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
The destination will definitely arrive

625
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The dream will definitely come true

626
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Love you, Happy

627
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Happy

628
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Happy

629
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Happy

630
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Happy

631
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Are you sleepy?

632
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Have a cup of coffee

633
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I am sick of drinking

634
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Sister Wan

635
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
A kiss that can't be sweeter

636
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
How to write this?

637
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Sweet but can't be sweeter

638
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Then you think about the special one in life

639
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
A little bit of a spiritual one

640
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And then there is a little bit of a little

641
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Sister Wan

642
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Do you have any difficult kisses in your memory?

643
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Share with me

644
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Because I ate

645
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
If you eat again, you can't taste it

646
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Of course

647
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Sister Wan

648
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Sister Wan

649
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Are you sleepy?

650
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'll get you a cup of coffee

651
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
No need

652
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'll write it

653
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You keep going

654
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Hello, Miss

655
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Please don't block the door

656
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Thank you

657
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'll be there in a minute

658
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The sky is really a hole

659
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I've been in the hole for so many days

660
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I can't climb up

661
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Sister Wan, I'm sorry

662
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You can't push this new guy

663
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I want to change him

664
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'll say hello in advance

665
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
How is that possible?

666
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What a joke

667
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Boss

668
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The old game in the martial arts world

669
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Why is the new drama so boring?

670
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You have to come and save the scene

671
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm sorry

672
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm sorry

673
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm sorry

674
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's our secret

675
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's so hard for me

676
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
How can you just accept it?

677
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Don't be so angry

678
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's almost the turn

679
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Really

680
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I can't think of anything good

681
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This kind of thing

682
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The first thing that comes to mind is me

683
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You're so righteous

684
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
To express my gratitude

685
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'll burn it right away

686
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It's delicious

687
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Eat whatever you want

688
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Eat to death

689
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't feel bad

690
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You don't feel bad

691
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I still feel bad for my body

692
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Besides, I'm not free

693
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm going to the next group

694
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
To see a sister's class

695
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Is it beautiful?

696
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You are a famous director anyway

697
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Look at your attention

698
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Beautiful

699
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Sweet

700
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Why don't you understand?

701
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Such a simple play

702
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You say

703
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
How many times have you played it?

704
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Deputy director

705
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Director

706
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Find me a good actor right now

707
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
This is not necessary

708
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Okay, director

709
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Okay, okay, director

710
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Don't be angry

711
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Maybe it's not too bad

712
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Just not suitable for this role

713
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Sister Li Na

714
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
My problem

715
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Solved immediately

716
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Do what you should do

717
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
OK, OK

718
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Director Jiang

719
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Why are you here?

720
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Director Jiang

721

761
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Why are you here?

762
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Director Jiang

763
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Why are you here?

764
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Director Jiang

765
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Why are you here?

766
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Director Jiang

767
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Why are you here?

768
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Director Jiang

769
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Why are you here?

770
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Director Jiang

771
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Why are you here?

772
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Director Jiang

773
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Why are you here?

774
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Director Jiang

775
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Why are you here?

776
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Director Jiang

777
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why are you here?

778
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Between the things that happened, it's very beautiful

779
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
When I look back, it's the most beautiful

780
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
To face myself

781
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Re-create or destroy

782
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's clear that I saw the moonlight

783
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The wind that blew after the road

784
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
In front of me, this big theater

785
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The show is endless

786
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I still have a little bit to learn

787
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's okay to be sad

788
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Life will end

789
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Whether you will or not

790
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Thank you for doing everything

791
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Let yourself be proud of that

792
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
With life from the beginning to the end

793
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
How do you think

794
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's not me

795
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Thank you for watching
