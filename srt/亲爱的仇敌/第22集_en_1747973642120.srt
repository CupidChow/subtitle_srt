1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Did you realize that Sonic 2 was not our ookid robot standpoint.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,080
Oh ...

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,600

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,220

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,320
i didn't realize they in fact made poisoned

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,680
Oh myете

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,560
i knew this was all

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,700
Artec

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,340
here it is

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,720
yet what's left is

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,380
lets drop the link

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,340
okay

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:28,740

You

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,740
You

18
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,740
You

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,740
You

20
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,740
You

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,740
You

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,740
You

23
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,740
You

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
You

25
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,740
You

26
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,740
You

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,740
You

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
How to go?

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,740
Or I'll let the driver drive you.

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,740
Luo Man,

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,740
Don't worry.

32
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,740
I always have a saying.

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,740
I really like your story.

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,740
President Zhou sent me a message.

35
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,740
I'm done.

36
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
Let's have a good chat next week.

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,740
OK, let's call him.

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,740
Be careful.

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm protecting our security.

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,740
To be honest,

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,740
Xiaoxu,

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
I've been serious since he wrote the first page.

43
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,740
I'm serious.

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,740
It's a little bit of a contribution to this story.

45
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,740
A big contribution.

46
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,740
When I was in the last page,

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,740
I also sent a similar

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,740
story to someone.

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,740
President Zhou,

50
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,740
You should give us a little bit of a head start.

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
Where is the name Ai?

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
OK, you decide.

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
I'm coming.

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Luo Man, we've made a deal. See you next week.

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,740
Take care.

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,740
Bye.

57
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Xiaoxu is quite a good-looking girl.

58
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,740
She's been

59
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,740
taking out the name of the

60
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
one of the two who was eliminated.

61
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,740
She's got a lot of energy.

62
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
Thank you.

63
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
I...

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,740
How about...

65
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,740
a little bit?

66
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
I'm tired today.

67
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
And I'm wearing high heels.

68
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
It's OK.

69
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
I can carry it.

70
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
After drinking,

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
walk around and relax.

72
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Otherwise, the injury will be very painful.

73
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
OK?

74
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740
Let's go.

75
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
OK.

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Thank you.

77
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Thank you.

78
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,740
The flower has grown.

79
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,740
15.

80
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
15.

81
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
15.

82
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
15.

83
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
15.

84
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,740
15.

85
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,740
15.

86
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,740
15.

87
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
How do you draw so little today?

88
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
What?

89
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,740
Draw little?

90
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
It's OK.

91
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,740
As long as it's so familiar,

92
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,740
you don't need to pretend.

93
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
You can save it if you want to draw.

94
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
You can save it.

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
What's wrong?

96
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
You don't even have the courage to act?

97
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,740
If you don't have a job,

98
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,740
you can't ask me to come out and eat.

99
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Do I have such a skill in your eyes?

100
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,740
I think I'm just that skill.

101
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
No.

102
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,740
You don't have to be so honest.

103
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
Honest?

104
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
You're handsome.

105
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
It's not my advantage.

106
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
What's wrong with coming out and eating?

107
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Is it bad for you to drink or not?

108
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
Or is it a waste of your time?

109
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
What?

110
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Mr. Zhou has been missing people to eat recently?

111
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
No.

112
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
He has been missing people to quarrel with.

113
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Have you been lonely recently?

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
It's still interesting to be with you.

115
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
It's interesting.

116
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
I'm not asking for one.

117
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
But you're different.

118
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Why are you different?

119
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Everyone is the same.

120
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
I'm not asking for one.

121
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Take it.

122
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
Then I want...

123
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Do you want to sit down and beg?

124
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Why is it so late?

125
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,740
The girl is not suitable for you.

126
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,740
This time, that movie...

127
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
I'm half-dead.

128
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Why do you want to test it?

129
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Have a good night-

130
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Over.

131
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,820
Yes, it's hard work.

132
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,840
However,

133
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,860
your little sister

134
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,880
shadows the reality.

135
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,320
You want a friend who can drive you out?

136
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,640
What he wants

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,040
And we have to study later.

138
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,760
We have to live for a long time before we find out.

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,800
We are talking about these things now.

140
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,320
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
I think it's quite appropriate.

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,720
I still think

143
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,320
there's no need to worry about it now.

144
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,440
We can talk more.

145
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,840
It's okay.

146
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,200
Did you even think it over?

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,280
You have always frickled yourself up.

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
You know,

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,400
people get so old

150
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,200
that they are interesting

151
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,760
over life's61if the current moment

152
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Although she is very stupid,

153
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,760
she tried to think of a woman to prove

154
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,760
that she is still passionate about her.

155
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm leaving.

156
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm leaving.

157
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,760
When I was one, my parents divorced.

158
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,760
They left me in the house of the outside world.

159
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,760
There are many people in the house of the outside world.

160
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Brothers and sisters, a pair of cousin,

161
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
and many children.

162
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
You know, I've never had a bed.

163
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,760
I don't need to talk about my own room.

164
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
My grandpa has a good team.

165
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
He is a person who is not strict enough.

166
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
I have to work very hard.

167
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
I have to do my best

168
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,760
to get back to him a certain smile.

169
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,760
From then on, I liked to look at the colors of the eyes.

170
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
I will be with someone.

171
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
It was also from then on,

172
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
when I was completely without anyone,

173
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
I was able to relax.

174
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,760
The secret relationship is very difficult for me.

175
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,760
I tried.

176
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,760
I tried.

177
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
I failed.

178
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,760
So,

179
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Boss,

180
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,760
it's not just that you are doing nothing wrong.

181
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
I'm not doing anything wrong.

182
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

184
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

185
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

186
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

187
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

188
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm doing it for the sake of my own good.

189
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Say it.

190
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
You didn't give it to me? When did you give it to me?

191
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Don't you care if he wants to?

192
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
No, Chen Kaixin, listen to me.

193
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,760
The human being will never be able to open up to the sky.

194
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm talking about this. You have to listen to me.

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I regret it for the rest of my life.

196
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Okay, okay, no problem.

197
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Thank you.

198
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Are you okay?

199
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm a little confused.

200
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,760
What is this marriage?

201
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
How can it be so unresolved?

202
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,760
If you listen to me,

203
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I don't think you should be too much into their business.

204
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Why?

205
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,760
They are two people.

206
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
One family.

207
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Sometimes, you don't need to be too much into their business.

208
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Then you can just keep holding on and keep your eyes down.

209
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,760
The relationship between the two is fighting and fighting.

210
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
And the point is,

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
for so many years,

212
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,760
have you been dealing with Chen Meiqi?

213
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
She might not only be a financial person,

214
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,760
but also a spiritual person.

215
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,760
So, you must be careful.

216
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Don't make yourself into an outsider.

217
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Why are you laughing?

218
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
It's still Mr. Zhou's business.

219
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
He has experience.

220
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
You know what?

221
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
I often

222
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,760
appreciate the kind of things you have.

223
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Even envy.

224
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
That kind of anger.

225
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Or the kind of memories you have for life.

226
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,760
You and I are not the same.

227
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Can you turn around?

228
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Turn around.

229
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
I felt that it was suitable for me to see her.

230
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
So, I bought her.

231
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,760
I think it's not suitable for me.

232
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I...

233
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,760
don't like to be in a relationship.

234
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Thank you.

235
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Thank you.

236
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Thank you.

237
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Thank you.

238
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
It's not enough.

239
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
It's enough.

240
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Let's go, baby.

241
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Tiao Tiao, why don't you go?

242
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
It's getting late.

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Don't make a bad impression on me.

244
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Mommy,

245
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,760
will you be the only one who's with me?

246
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
I'm not going.

247
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm going to be late.

248
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Don't make a bad impression on me.

249
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Mommy,

250
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,760
will you be the only one who's with me?

251
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm not going.

252
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Mommy, I'll be with you forever, okay?

253
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Mommy, here, hurry!

254
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Mommy, let's go.

255
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Hello.

256
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Tieta's father, Tieta's mother,

257
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
do you want to drink something?

258
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
We still need to talk.

259
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Then, let's have some coffee.

260
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Okay.

261
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
I don't need to thank you, teacher.

262
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Okay.

263
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Hello.

264
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Hi, Johnny.

265
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
My name is Luisa.

266
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
And I'm here to give you a school tour.

267
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Do you want to go with me?

268
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Let's go.

269
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Have fun.

270
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I think Tieta is a good person in the school.

271
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,760
She went to many places with you during the holidays.

272
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Yes.

273
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Why didn't you think about

274
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
sending Tieta to the school of Tieta?

275
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Why did you think of going to the school of diamonds?

276
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
We chose diamonds.

277
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
It's a lesson for us to learn about diamonds.

278
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
It's not about the school of diamonds.

279
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
It's about bringing the child to explore the relationship between you and the world.

280
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,760
It seems that you've done a lot of homework.

281
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Then,

282
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,760
what do you care about the child's growth and education?

283
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,760
We hope that she can have the ability to have the world's best experience.

284
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,760
She can let the child learn to speak more languages.

285
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm very good at teaching.

286
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
My wife said it was good just now.

287
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
But what we care more is

288
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,760
the self-reliance and independence of the child.

289
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Because we think that every child has its own advantages.

290
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
As long as they have freedom,

291
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
they will definitely become a elite in some fields.

292
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
And we also think that

293
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
we shouldn't give the child too much framework.

294
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Because framework is the comfort.

295
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
But every child is actually a sea of ​​sea.

296
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Comfort sea is not something you can eat.

297
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Oh, my son is here.

298
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Tiao Tiao, good bye, Johnny.

299
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Good bye.

300
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Bye.

301
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Good job.

302
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Tiao Tiao, are you having fun today?

303
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Tiao Tiao, who usually takes you to kindergarten?

304
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Mommy.

305
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Then who accompanies you the most?

306
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Mommy.

307
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Oh, it's all mommy.

308
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Mommy is so great.

309
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Tiao Tiao,

310
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
what is your favorite personal activity?

311
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,760
Daddy, mommy, when we went out for a trip together,

312
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Daddy taught me to kick the ball.

313
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Mommy gave us a video.

314
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
And mommy made a leek box.

315
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Daddy loves it the most.

316
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
I also love it.

317
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
So happy.

318
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
So great.

319
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
That's the best way to protect yourself.

320
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
I think this is the right way.

321
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
We just performed well.

322
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
It's so great, honey.

323
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Honey, how about this?

324
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Let's take a picture together.

325
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Let's remember our perfect cooperation.

326
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Right, son?

327
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Yes.

328
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Come on, son.

329
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Let's take a photo.

330
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Come on.

331
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Let's go, mommy.

332
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Okay, let's look at the camera, okay?

333
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Okay, one, two, three.

334
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Who's calling?

335
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Honey,

336
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
I'm so happy today.

337
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Why?

338
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Because I've never seen such a big library.

339
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
I want to get one.

340
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
You want to get one?

341
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
It's so cool.

342
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Then you take mommy to the library.

343
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Let's start shopping together.

344
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Daddy is coming.

345
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Daddy said he's a man.

346
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
He's a man.

347
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Let's go to bed.

348
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Okay.

349
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I love you.

350
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Mommy, I love you too.

351
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Close your eyes.

352
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Miss Chen,

353
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
according to the past cases,

354
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,760
your full-time mom is not that high.

355
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Many people are only two years old.

356
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
You must think carefully.

357
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
I'm sorry.

358
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm sorry.

364
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
I'm sorry.

365
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm sorry.

366
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
I'm sorry.

367
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
I'm sorry.

368
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm sorry.

369
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Honey,

370
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
where's my pajamas?

371
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
The second drawer in the closet.

372
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I only found the pajamas.

373
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
I didn't find the pajamas.

374
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Can you find it for me?

375
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Thank you.

376
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Honey,

377
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
this is for you.

378
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Take a look.

379
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Honey,

380
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
this is for you and Tiao Tiao.

381
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Honey,

382
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
this is for you.

383
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Honey,

384
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
I've been interested in you

385
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
for the rest of my life.

386
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,760
You're the wife of my family.

387
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,760
I'm not a thief.

388
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
I can't bear to see you anymore.

389
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I'm going out now.

390
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm going to the hotel.

391
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
I'm going to the guest room.

392
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Honey,

393
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Honey,

394
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
that kid is gone.

395
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
He fell down for a long time.

396
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I asked him to go out.

397
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
I also signed the agreement.

398
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
It really has nothing to do with our family.

399
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Honey,

400
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I was wrong.

401
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
I was wrong.

402
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
But I know what I'm thinking.

403
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
In this life,

404
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I'm the only son

405
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
that you can have.

406
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Kexin,

407
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
no matter how many women are out there,

408
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
they only see me as a father.

409
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,760
When no one sees me as their grandson,

410
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
only you see me.

411
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Only you accompany me

412
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
until the day of the end.

413
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm not a thief.

414
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I want to go with a man.

415
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Say,

416
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
look,

417
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I did it.

418
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
I really did it.

419
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
But this man can only be you.

420
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Only you.

421
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
You are the one,

422
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm not a thief.

423
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Chen Kexin,

424
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
you are my starting point.

425
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
You are also my ending point.

426
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Do you understand?

427
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,040
Family

428
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,940
Affection

429
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,600
只

430
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,980
to know this place

431
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,220
we

432
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,640
O Sports

433
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,360
I'll take you to A Yuan.

434
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,160
Go now.

435
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,080
It's hard to get a chance.

436
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,520
Say bye to mommy.

437
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Bye, mommy.

438
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,200
I'll see you later.

439
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Be happy.

440
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,560
Uncle.

441
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,080
Take care.

442
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,920
Come, son.

443
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,640
Have a seat.

444
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,360
Go on.

445
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,560
No need.

446
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,440
Just a few words.

447
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,240
Just say it.

448
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
After all, he's the father of the child.

449
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,720
He's still a child.

450
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,160
What's the matter with the sandbag?

451
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,440
Isn't it good to have some work?

452
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,880
You're beautiful.

453
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,560
You're beautiful.

454
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,680
Why do you look so good?

455
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,240
I look good.

456
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,000
I look really good.

457
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,800
Thank you.

458
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
You're welcome.

459
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,920
He is dead.

460
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
Three hungry friends

461
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,600
came to A Yuan.

462
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,940
Philippine

463
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
You.

464
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
kuin don't have sputum?

465
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
The most important thing is to let your family know.

466
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
OK.

467
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I will do my best.

468
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
OK.

469
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I will do my best.

470
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
OK.

471
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I will do my best.

472
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
OK.

473
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
OK.

474
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
OK.

475
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
OK.

476
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
OK.

477
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
OK.

478
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
OK.

479
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
OK.

480
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Enjoy yourselves.

481
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Thank you.

482
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Are they asking for the food over there

483
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
or any way out for me

484
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,400
when I ask you for a meal?

485
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Didn't you say that they are all so familiar

486
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
that they don't need to come to those shows?

487
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Oh, right.

488
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Did Sister Xiao Xu send you the contract?

489
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,400
She did. I saw it.

490
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,400
If you need anything, let me send it to you.

491
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Mr. Zhou, your service has been very good lately.

492
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,400
It's a good opportunity to give you some credit.

493
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Give me credit? Why?

494
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I don't have a big profit to pay you back.

495
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Fine.

496
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
You can tell me if you want to pay me back.

497
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
How's it going with Kai Qi?

498
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Did you drink it?

499
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
It's not that good.

500
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
I think you're right.

501
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Really.

502
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm not the one who's going to say anything.

503
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,400
I should put all my energy on myself.

504
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm really feeling very tired now.

505
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I can sleep for one more minute every day.

506
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,400
It seems that it's a good experience to be with young people.

507
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Here.

508
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Eat something good.

509
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,400
It's tiring to be with someone.

510
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm going to hit the mountain.

511
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Wait.

512
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Why are you still washing?

513
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I'm washing.

514
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Are you done?

515
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
No, honey.

516
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
I just washed it and it's a little dirty.

517
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Chen Tiao Tiao, you're going to sleep.

518
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Honey, you go first.

519
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I'll go to bed later.

520
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Here.

521
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Is your mom good?

522
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Yes.

523
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Do you know why dad is good?

524
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Why?

525
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
Because we're men.

526
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
We're married before men.

527
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
That's why he's the best.

528
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Are you ready?

529
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Are you tired these days?

530
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
You can run and watch the movie at night.

531
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
You can drink and watch the movie.

532
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
You can play the game.

533
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
You have to take care of your wife when you're home.

534
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
I'm really tired.

535
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I can't do anything.

536
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I'm going to be released soon.

537
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
But I'm going to work.

538
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Did you almost hit the line when your brother was pushing the cow?

539
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,400
I told him in the dormitory that I'll take you to the gym.

540
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
That's right.

541
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I didn't get scolded by you until today.

542
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Stop talking.

543
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Drink it.

544
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,400
The last one is the best.

545
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Come on.

546
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Zhou, how's your work?

547
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Women?

548
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
How can you be so sure?

549
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
But to be honest,

550
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Mr. Zhou has been a great gift this time.

551
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Thank you.

552
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Here.

553
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
We're brothers.

554
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Don't say such polite things.

555
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Women?

556
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Well,

557
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
you guys talk first.

558
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
I'm going out to meet a friend.

559
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
It's been just a few days.

560
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Don't make any trouble.

561
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
You're so kind.

562
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
You're so kind.

563
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm going.

564
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I'm going.

565
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
You guys are so kind.

566
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
You like climbing.

567
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
You're stupid.

568
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
You're so rich.

569
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
You think you're a superman.

570
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
You're a god.

571
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
We're not.

572
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
We're the official staff.

573
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
That's the official staff.

574
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
The official staff is good.

575
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Think about it.

576
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
You're so kind.

577
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
You're so active.

578
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
You're so great.

579
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Besides,

580
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
eating, watching movies,

581
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
you're so kind.

582
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
The official staff is different.

583
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
You're so pure.

584
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
You're like a couple.

585
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
What's missing in a group?

586
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Xiaosu,

587
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
I'll pick up the phone.

588
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
You go ahead.

589
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
The last scene

590
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
can't be wrong.

591
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
And,

592
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
what's the last scene?

593
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
No, no, no.

594
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
I have to change it.

595
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay, okay.

596
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Okay, okay.

597
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Okay.

598
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Bye.

599
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
You're so thoughtful.

600
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
I can handle it.

601
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
You're so stupid.

602
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Qingcheng,

603
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
how about...

604
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
How about we?

605
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
How thoughtful.

606
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Look,

607
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
this is the youngest in the park.

608
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Right?

609
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
You've been here with me.

610
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
There's a kid.

611
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
He's got a bunch of kids.

612
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Can't you see?

613
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm not kidding.

614
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Really.

615
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Let's make it better.

616
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Qingcheng,

617
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I know you're worried.

618
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,400
I left a lot of money for her.

619
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
No matter if we're divorced,

620
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
they're all their money.

621
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Of course,

622
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
I know that

623
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
she lost her youth

624
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
because of this money.

625
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
But I think...

626
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I should be the one

627
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
who should be the one.

628
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
I should be the one who should be the one.

629
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
That's what I want.

630
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Zhong Qingcheng,

631
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
I really, really want to be with you.

632
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Really.

633
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Then,

634
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
let's be together.

635
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Then...

636
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Then...

637
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Then,

638
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
let's be happy together.

639
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
We've reached the end of the world.

640
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
1, 2,

641
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
8,

642
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
1,

643
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
6,

644
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
5,

645
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
4,

646
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
3,

647
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
2,

648
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
1.

649
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Go!

650
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Go!

651
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Go!

652
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Go!

653
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Go!

654
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Go!

655
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Go!

656
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Go!

657
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Go!

658
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Go!

659
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Go!

660
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Go!

661
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Go!

662
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Go!

663
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Go!

664
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Go!

665
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

666
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

667
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

668
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

669
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

670
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

671
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

672
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

673
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

674
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

675
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

676
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

677
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

678
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

679
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm going to make a toast.

680
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I'm going to make a little bit of a drink.

681
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
The fruit is ready.

682
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Cheers

683
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Cheers

684
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
I eat a few doughnuts.

685
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Then I put it into a machine.

686
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
And my good friend put the doughnuts inside the machine.

687
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Then I put the doughnuts inside the machine.

688
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
IMr Salot

689
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Mr. Salot

690
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Mr. Salot

691
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,900
Mr. Salot

692
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,400
Just a little bit.

693
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Mr. Salot

694
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Mr. Salot

695
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
A little bit

696
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
It's not super nochego.

697
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
It's pretty sweet.

698
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm sorry.

699
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
When I was taking a bath,

700
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
the water

701
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
was still running out.

702
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I lost the floor.

703
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
I didn't dare to look for the garden.

704
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I was afraid that she would say that

705
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
I could only look for a garden.

706
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I cleaned the floor.

707
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Honey,

708
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I really didn't expect that I could have a good day.

709
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Really.

710
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
When I was young,

711
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I played basketball on the floor.

712
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
And my son,

713
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
he told me.

714
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
If I think about it like this,

715
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,400
it's worth it to be tired and tired.

716
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Tomorrow is a good day.

717
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Don't feel tired today.

718
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
I miss you.

719
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Don't.

720
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Honey,

721
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
are you

722
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,400
preparing something special for me?

723
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Tea.

724
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Tea.

725
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Open it.

726
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
What's this surprise?

727
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
What is it?

728
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Will it come out soon?

729
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Nara.

730
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
What's the point?

731
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Is something big going to happen to you?

732
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Honey,

733
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
do you think

734
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
taiji will make it clear between you and Tsurst desperation?

735
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
I dont know.

736
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Alright,

737
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Sorry,

738
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Quiet, quiet

739
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Laid back

740
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,820
I thought I'd make a lot of money

741
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,140
I seriously thought I can sacrifice my baby

742
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,840
Good right

743
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,300
We are close

744
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,300
The days are calm like water

745
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,300
Even if the rain is not over

746
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,300
The days are as good as they are

747
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,300
The world is beautiful

748
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,300
The most beautiful when you are back

749
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,300
You have to face your own

750
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,300
The red fire is broken

751
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,300
I saw the moon in the sky

752
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,300
The wind is blowing in the wind

753
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:03,300
The wind is blowing in the wind

754
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,300
