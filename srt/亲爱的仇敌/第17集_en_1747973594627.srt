Mm

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
I might need you to make a decision.

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,880
Temp Lane

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,560
Would you like to go up there with me?

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:49,000
Think the present man compliqué

I'm sorry.

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Is there any problem?

34
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
No.

35
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
No.

36
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Then please sign on the agreement of the surgery.

37
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Who will sign it?

38
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
I'll sign it.

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
The nurse will arrive tomorrow morning.

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
And the food is ready.

41
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
You guys eat.

42
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Call me if you need anything.

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
I'll come tomorrow morning.

44
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,920
It's late. Be careful.

45
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Go.

46
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
I didn't mean to get angry.

47
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
I just want to know

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
if you have any problems with me.

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Okay.

50
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
If you don't mind,

51
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
I'll give you a hand.

52
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I need to talk to you.

53
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
If I don't mind,

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
I'll give you a hand.

55
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I'll give you a hand.

56
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I'll give you a hand,

57
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
I'll give you a hand.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
I'll give you a hand.

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
I just want to know

60
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
if people are like this at the age of one

61
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
to each other

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
It's all a matter of time

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
that I need you

64
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Sometimes

65
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
I also like to have hands

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
to hold me

67
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Is it only me

68
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
or is it all the same

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
I

70
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Hello

71
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Can you come with me tonight?

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Yes

73
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Baby

74
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
There are many little guests

75
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
who have not been living in the house for a long time

76
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
How about we change a room?

77
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Let's deal with it one night

78
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
It's so much to live one night

79
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Is it a little exaggerated?

80
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Even if you live one night

81
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
you have to live comfortably

82
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You are too exaggerated, Chen Kaixi

83
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
I am already very experienced

84
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
I have been sleeping all day today

85
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
You haven't seen a dozen children

86
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I have a headache

87
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Really

88
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Perfect

89
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Thank you

90
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Dr. Luo is very quiet

91
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
She wants to sleep

92
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
She drinks very well every day

93
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
You don't write script

94
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Chen Kaixi is so hungry

95
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
If you need money, tell me

96
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Don't talk to the boss

97
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
You two are dating

98
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
and have a relationship

99
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Do you know?

100
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
You are so hungry

101
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I am so hungry

102
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I will call you to eat

103
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Chen Kaixi, you are really

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
So fragrant

105
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Can your pregnant woman eat these?

106
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Is there a pot of oil?

107
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Spicy hot pot is the kind of food that tastes good

108
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
So fragrant

109
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
It's a little like the smell of the school

110
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
The smell of the school's funeral

111
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Yes, it's the one in the back door

112
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
It's so delicious

113
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I still remember

114
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I couldn't find this pork belly in the past

115
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Do you know where this pork belly is?

116
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Where?

117
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
It was secretly hidden in her bowl

118
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
This little kid is so angry

119
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
He really can't get on the child's face

120
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Oh, right

121
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I saw him a few days ago

122
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
He didn't tell me

123
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
We...

124
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Did you quarrel?

125
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Which family did you quarrel with?

126
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Forget it, I can't help it

127
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
No, he is pregnant

128
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
He brought the child to travel

129
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
He is in the restaurant now

130
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
How is your life now?

131
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
It's still the same

132
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm not sure

133
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Come up and ask

134
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Have you got married?

135
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I said no

136
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
That eyes are full of sympathy

137
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Look at you

138
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Just that kind of high position

139
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Come

140
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
The kind of low position

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll wait

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Tell me

143
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
You are different from us

144
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
You are a person with a ideal and a revenge

145
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
How much money can you get?

146
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Do you have any works?

147
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
I didn't want to understand him

148
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,920
But he just released my show in the TV

149
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
And I said

150
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
It's nothing

151
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
I wrote that show

152
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
He was in the middle of it

153
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
It's been so many years

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
And still like that

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Then he asked me

156
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
How could he not ask you?

157
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
He loved you the most since he was a kid

158
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Xi Xi

159
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
What about Xi Xi?

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
I said

161
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Xi Xi is a resident

162
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
She lives in the suburbs

163
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I said

164
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
The house is in the suburbs

165
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
And she changed her face

166
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I said

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Xi Xi is also very hard

168
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
She has a big family

169
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
She can't help her in the city

170
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
After all, the company is going to start

171
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
She is very busy

172
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Didn't you see that face?

173
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
A light white

174
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
A light white

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
In such a short time

176
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
So many layers changed

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
So amazing

178
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I want to see it

179
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
You should take a picture

180
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
It's okay

181
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
I have a WeChat account

182
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Next time I will make a reservation

183
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Xi Xi

184
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
You remember that thing?

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
What thing?

186
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
Zhang Han said

187
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Chen Mian chased me

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Remember

189
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Chen Kai Xi

190
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
This is also a marriage proposal

191
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
You don't know, right?

192
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
You know

193
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Chen Mian was in the Yingsing House

194
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
It was the first Luo Man in the province

195
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
But he didn't chase Luo Man

196
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
And he didn't want to go to the city

197
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
He didn't want to go to the city

198
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
But he didn't chase Luo Man

199
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
And he was happy

200
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Miss Chen

201
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Let's go there and get our hair done

202
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
After all

203
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
We don't have much contact

204
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Is it because of this?

205
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You don't contact me anymore

206
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
You were busy at that time

207
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I was very fast

208
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,920
We live in different values

209
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
And we have different attitudes

210
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,920
We are really close

211
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Don't tell me this is a reason for being in a relationship

212
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I want to be honest

213
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
What do you think?

214
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Are you stupid?

215
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm not stupid

216
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Who is stupid?

217
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Chen Mian's hair style

218
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
He looks like you

219
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
How is that possible?

220
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Yes

221
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Who are you talking about?

222
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
You are my uncle

223
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Uncle

224
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
I'm your uncle

225
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I'm your uncle

226
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm your uncle

227
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm your uncle

228
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
I'm your uncle

229
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm your uncle

230
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm your uncle

231
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm your uncle

232
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm your uncle

233
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm your uncle

234
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
I'm your uncle

235
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm your uncle

236
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm your uncle

237
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I'm your uncle

238
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I'm your uncle

239
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm your uncle

240
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
We are here

241
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Luo

242
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Don't be nervous

243
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
We are waiting for you

244
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Dad, you always say

245
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
You are here when you are tested

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
You can take the test

247
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
You will be fine

248
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Luo Hongwen

249
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Yes

250
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Okay

251
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Uncle

252
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Please take care of Luo Man

253
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Don't worry

254
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Thank you

255
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
You are welcome

256
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
I'm fine

257
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
I'm not nervous

258
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I'm here to sign the contract

259
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm here to sign the contract

260
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
You will be fine

261
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Don't be nervous

262
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Uncle

263
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
How is it?

264
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
It's okay

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I'm slow

266
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Sit down

267
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
You are not working at night?

268
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Didn't sleep?

269
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Go back to the room

270
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Uncle, how long have you been in?

271
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Two hours

272
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Two hours

273
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
It's normal

274
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
It's normal

275
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Luo Hongwen, I'm at home

276
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm here

277
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Director

278
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
The operation is over

279
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
It's a success

280
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
The patient is a micro-chip

281
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
It's good to have a operation

282
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Doctor, you mean

283
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
It's okay, right?

284
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
You can't say that

285
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
If you don't sign the contract

286
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
You will have a risk

287
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Of course

288
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
We will wait for the result

289
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
In the end

290
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
The doctor will explain it to you

291
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
But in general

292
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
The operation is good

293
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Thank you

294
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Thank you

295
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay, that's it

296
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm fine

297
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Don't worry

298
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Thank you, doctor

299
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Are you okay?

300
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I'm fine

301
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm fine

302
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I'm fine

303
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Why?

304
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
I have only one thing in mind

305
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I must be a better person

306
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Fine

307
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I don't want to

308
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
I know

309
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
I will always love you

310
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
I will always be yours

311
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I will always be yours

312
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I will always be yours

313
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
I will always be yours

314
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I will always be yours

315
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
I must be a better person.

316
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
I will.

317
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
I have been in bed for a few days.

318
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I want to wait for dad to be ready.

319
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
It's quite good to be out.

320
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
It's so far away.

321
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
We don't need to come back.

322
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Auntie, don't worry.

323
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Uncle will be better and better.

324
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Thank you, Kai Xi.

325
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
You're welcome.

326
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I'll go first.

327
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Thank you.

328
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Thank you.

329
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
It's okay.

330
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
We'll be better and better.

331
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Give me something to do.

332
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Okay.

333
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Cheese for Key.

334
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Cheese for Key.

335
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
And, L's for Lights.

336
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
And, L's for Likes.

337
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Check my signals.

338
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Check my signal.

339
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,720
Ms. Wan Myks

340
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Ms. Wan Myks

341
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Ms. Wan Myks

342
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Ms. Wan Myks

343
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Ms. Wan Myks

344
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Ms. Wan Myks

345
00:20:50,920 --> 00:21:18,100
Roasted

346
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
Fang Chi.

361
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
I'm calling you.

362
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Uncle.

363
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,100
You're in good health.

364
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Well, the doctor said that I'm fine.

365
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I'll be fine tomorrow.

366
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Don't worry.

367
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Okay, I'll take a good rest.

368
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I'll come back to see you.

369
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Okay, okay.

370
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Hello, Dr. Luo.

371
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Looks like you're recovering well.

372
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
You'll be discharged tomorrow.

373
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm a little bit sick when I'm coughing.

374
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
That's right, uncle.

375
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
I coughed to get the blanket out of my body.

376
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I didn't want to get infected.

377
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
I'll be better after I'm out of the hospital.

378
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
So I can take a good rest.

379
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Okay, I'll be fine soon.

380
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Did you just hang up?

381
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
No.

382
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
I just saw him at the door.

383
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
I won't go to the state.

384
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
Chen Jian?

385
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Didn't you just see him a few days ago?

386
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
I'll report to you.

387
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,100
My dad is doing well.

388
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,100
I heard from Fang Chi that you're in the hospital.

389
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Are you done?

390
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Let's have dinner together.

391
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Hello?

392
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I'm in the hospital for the medicine.

393
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
I think this is better for Fang Chi.

394
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Okay.

395
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Yes.

396
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Hello, honey?

397
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
It's okay.

398
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
I can do it myself.

399
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
I might be disappointed if I jump.

400
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,100
He thought he could see me today.

401
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
But it's okay.

402
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Don't force yourself.

403
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Bye-bye.

404
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I'm doing well.

405
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
I think we can do it.

406
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Great.

407
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
I'll be back at 2 p.m.

408
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I think I can prepare.

409
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
No problem.

410
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Don't worry, Mrs. Chen.

411
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Thank you.

412
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Doctor, are you okay?

413
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Wait a minute.

414
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Come on, wipe it.

415
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
There's no more remover.

416
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
What do you mean?

417
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
The bag stopped being remover.

418
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
No.

419
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Doctor.

420
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
How could this happen?

421
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Wasn't everything okay when we were on the scene?

422
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
I usually drink a lot.

423
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
I don't feel well either.

424
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Can you check it again?

425
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
We've checked it.

426
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
It's okay.

427
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Miss Ke,

429
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Director Nian said she likes girls the most.

430
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
I think you can definitely choose your girl.

431
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Put this here.

432
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
And it will be ready.

433
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Who wants this?

434
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
The biggest one.

435
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
This is for the guests.

436
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Okay.

437
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Thank you for coming today.

438
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Don't worry about me.

439
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,100
I'll bring the kids over there.

440
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Thank you.

441
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,100
I'll put this on your hand.

442
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
I'll show you.

443
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Two little balls are running over.

444
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,100
I'm going to give a gift to our lovely little girl.

445
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
It's a gift from the people.

446
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Happy birthday, Miss Ke.

447
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Thank you.

448
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Give it to mommy.

449
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Mommy.

450
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Happy birthday.

451
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Is this for me?

452
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Hello, auntie.

453
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Let's play.

454
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
It's so warm.

455
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,100
I heard that you're going to be a brother.

456
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Congratulations, Miss Ke.

457
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Congratulations.

458
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Congratulations.

459
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Congratulations.

460
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Congratulations.

461
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Congratulations.

462
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Congratulations.

463
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Congratulations.

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Congratulations.

465
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
You're a big girl.

466
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
Congratulations.

467
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Let's wish you a happy birthday.

468
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Happy birthday.

469
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Happy birthday.

470
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
Mom, you're so cute.

471
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Happy birthday to you.

472
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Happy birthday to you.

473
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Mom, congratulations.

474
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Today is your birthday.

475
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
But your dad is going to do a task.

476
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,100
So he sent me here to wish you a happy birthday.

477
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Happy birthday, Miss Ke.

478
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Happy birthday, Miss Ke.

479
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
I like your car the most.

480
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Dad gave it to me.

481
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Do you like it?

482
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Yes.

483
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
Hello, auntie.

484
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
Hello, auntie.

485
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Let's play with the kids.

486
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Okay.

487
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,100
Happy birthday, Miss Ke.

488
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
One, two, three.

489
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Happy birthday, Miss Ke.

490
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Let's see what's next.

491
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Here.

492
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
It's a big box.

493
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
What's this?

494
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
Here.

495
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
It's a clay.

496
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
What's wrong?

497
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
You should take the next one.

498
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Don't you like clay?

499
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,100
I'll play with my sister.

500
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I'll give her a small car.

501
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
You're a coward.

502
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
How can you be a sister?

503
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Didn't you say you want a brother?

504
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
You and your brother are a big family.

505
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
You and your brother are like sisters.

506
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Then you want a sister.

507
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,100
I've made up my mind.

508
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
If my sister is a good girl,

509
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,100
I'll have a brother.

510
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Okay?

511
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Okay.

512
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
You're the best.

513
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Mom,

514
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Cheng Cheng said she'll see my sister in nine months.

515
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,100
She said she'll be ten months old.

516
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
How long will she be?

517
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Let me hug you.

518
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I love you, too.

519
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
I love you.

520
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I love you, too.

521
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
I love you, too.

522
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
Congratulations.

523
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
You're so good at playing the role of a bride.

524
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Congratulations.

525
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Hello.

526
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Hello.

527
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
You're still in the middle of the game.

528
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Yes, we're in the middle of the game.

529
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Yes, we're in the middle of the game.

530
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Hello.

531
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Are you busy?

532
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,100
I asked your mother to come with me tonight.

533
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Where are you?

534
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm here.

535
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Why are you here alone?

536
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Tell me, I'm here with you.

537
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm alone.

538
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
I'm in the air.

539
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
I've arranged everything at home.

540
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,100
My aunt made the least of it.

541
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,100
She'll make me a little moon when I get back.

542
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
It's painful.

543
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,100
You were afraid of the cold.

544
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,100
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

545
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

546
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,100
The doctor said the treatment was not good.

547
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
The color was too soft.

548
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Do you remember?

549
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
I told you.

550
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm pregnant.

551
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,100
You told me this is a gift from God.

552
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I thought so.

553
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
I think...

554
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
My marriage is saved.

555
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,100
You said...

556
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,100
Is it a baby looking up from heaven?

557
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
You think we're a bad family?

558
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
So he didn't want to come.

559
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Xixi.

560
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
The most important thing is your health.

561
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Don't think about it.

562
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,100
You'll be covered in pain.

563
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Cry. I'm here.

564
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
I'm here.

565
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Are you okay?

566
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Mr. Chen.

567
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Where are you?

568
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I've checked the Hong Kong area.

569
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I've checked the Hong Kong area.

570
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
I've checked the Sanjiu old man.

571
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Do you know your wife is a cow?

572
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Chen Min.

573
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Did you forget how you followed Chen Kaixi

574
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
like a puppy?

575
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Chen Kaixi has been following you

576
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
all his life.

577
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Do you think you've earned some money

578
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
and don't know who you are?

579
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Can you do business with your money?

580
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Thank you.

581
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Look at yourself.

582
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
I'm telling you.

583
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
If it wasn't for Chen Kaixi,

584
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
you would have been a dog.

585
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
I'm leaving.

586
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Honey.

587
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
I'm sorry.

588
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
I'm sorry.

589
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
I'm not sleeping.

590
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Honey.

591
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I'm not sleeping.

592
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,100
I can do anything.

593
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm serious.

594
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Honey.

595
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I'm sorry.

596
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
I'm sorry.

597
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,100
I'm sorry.

598
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
This one?

599
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Yes.

600
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
He should like it.

601
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Miss Hou.

602
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Can you make some dish for him?

603
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Alright.

604
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,600
Thank you.

605
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I'll go upstairs.

606
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Xiao Xiao.

607
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,300
You're already with Zuhan.

608
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,600
Your mom is sick.

609
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,800
If your dad is not at home,

610
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
can you take care of your mom and dad?

611
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,000
Okay.

612
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Son,

613
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,600
the agreement between men and women.

614
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,100
Pull the hook up.

615
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Don't let it change.

616
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,000
It's a little dog.

617
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Let's go.

618
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm sorry.

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sorry.

624
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm sorry.

625
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm sorry.

626
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm sorry.

627
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm sorry.

628
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm sorry.

629
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sorry.

630
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm sorry.

635
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm sorry.

636
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm sorry.

639
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm sorry.

645
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,900
I'm sorry.

647
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,900
I'm sorry.

648
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
I'll handle this tomorrow.

649
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Yue.

651
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,900
My friend,

652
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
my brother is here.

653
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
He's working.

654
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,900
I'm so tired.

655
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Okay.

656
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
I'm so happy.

657
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
I'm getting better.

658
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Thank you, sir.

659
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Okay.

660
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Let's change the scene.

661
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Okay.

662
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,900
Change the scene.

663
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Sister.

664
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
Are you okay with Sister Kaixi?

665
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
What?

666
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
Don't worry.

667
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
We'll go to the New Smith Hall.

668
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
We'll give your friends a good bye.

669
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
We'll be there for you.

670
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,900
We'll be there for you.

671
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
After we leave,

672
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,900
you have to take good care of yourself.

673
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Or don't stay up all night.

674
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Don't drink coffee.

675
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
You have to eat at the same time.

676
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,900
And,

677
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
how can you live in a house

678
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
with your own money?

679
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
You're still living in a house.

680
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
It's good.

681
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
If you want to renovate the new house,

682
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
you still have to spend a little money.

683
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
No need.

684
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,900
And I'm used to living in this house.

685
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Dad,

686
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
do you think

687
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,900
you don't have the face like this?

688
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Our face is not important.

689
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
How can we live comfortably?

690
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Take good care of yourself.

691
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
If there's anything,

692
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
just say it.

693
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
You too.

694
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Body is the most important thing.

695
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,800
You have to take good care of yourself when you go back.

696
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Eat at the same time.

697
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
If you want to eat,

698
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
drink,

699
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
or use,

700
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
you have to mention it to me.

701
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Don't be embarrassed.

702
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
You see,

703
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
my daughter is out.

704
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
She's starting to get pregnant.

705
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,700
My daughter is out.

706
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
She's starting to take care of me.

707
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
I'm going.

708
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
What's going on?

709
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
What's going on?

710
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
What's going on?

711
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,700
What's going on?

712
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
It's not a good idea.

713
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,700
Director,

714
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,700
someone's arrived.

715
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,700
Okay.

716
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,700
Let's go to the scene.

717
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Okay.

718
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,700
Come on.

719
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Come on.

720
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,700
I know it's going to be a big deal

721
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,700
if I get trapped like this.

722
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,700
It's going to be a big deal.

723
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Okay.

724
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Dad, do you need help?

725
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
No need.

726
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,700
It looks fun.

727
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Go.

728
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,700
Look at your son.

729
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,700
How is your dad?

730
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
What is this?

731
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
What is this?

732
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,700
I wish you a happy new year, and wealth to all the world.

733
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
Send me the money.

734
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
Uncle, happy new year.

735
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,700
Mom is here.

736
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Xiaoting, who are you?

737
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,700
Auntie, happy new year.

738
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,700
Happy new year.

739
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,700
Mom, you look more beautiful without the wedding.

740
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,700
No, no. You are still the same as my sister.

741
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,700
Look at your little mouth.

742
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Xiaotetian, do you want it?

743
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,700
Auntie, do you want to say something to your dad?

744
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,700
Thank you, auntie.

745
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,700
Congratulations on your wealth, health, and prosperity.

746
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,700
Very good.

747
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Xixi, don't be busy.

748
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,700
I'll come to help you later.

749
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,700
Dad, it's okay.

750
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,700
You can play with your wife.

751
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,700
I'll sit down and play.

752
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,700
You can find it tomorrow.

753
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Where is Chen Mian?

754
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,700
Chen Mian called upstairs.

755
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
She said she was short of money.

756
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,700
They will contact everywhere.

757
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,700
I hope that you can get better next year.

758
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,700
I will.

759
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,700
Big star.

760
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,700
Big star.

761
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Xing Chen.

762
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,700
Sister, sister, sister Kai. Happy new year.

763
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,700
Happy new year.

764
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,700
Happy new year.

765
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,700
You are still staying in the crew.

766
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,700
You won't be home for the next year?

767
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,700
I was just in the mood.

768
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,700
But I sent a big red envelope.

769
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,700
And my mom came to accompany me.

770
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
Xing Chen, thank you.

771
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,700
You even helped me to buy this bracelet.

772
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,700
And the peace dress my parents asked for.

773
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,700
It's a little bit of a relief.

774
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,700
I'm not here when you have something to do.

775
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
I hope that we can all be safe and sound

776
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,700
and be happy and happy next year.

777
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,700
I wish you a happy new year.

778
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,700
Happy new year.

779
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,700
I won't say it.

780
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
I might have to go and take a photo.

781
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,700
I will talk to you later.

782
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
Bye.

783
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Bye.

784
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
You worked hard.

785
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,700
Yes.

786
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,700
After this,

787
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,700
I suddenly have a new feeling in my life.

788
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,700
What do you mean?

789
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,700
I think

790
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,700
God is kind to me.

791
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,700
You see, my dad is sick.

792
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,700
But he can't do the surgery

793
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,700
even if he's been out for half a month.

794
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,700
Right?

795
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,700
Yes.

796
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,700
Especially when I went to the hospital

797
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
to get my dad the medicine,

798
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,700
you didn't know the scene of the hospital.

799
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,700
I only have one thing in my mind.

800
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,700
Life is a small thing

801
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,700
when you are born and die.

802
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
We three

803
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
are healthy and safe.

804
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
It's more important than anything else.

805
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Yes.

806
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
Everything is fake.

807
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,700
Health and safety are the most important.

808
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,700
Are we old?

809
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,700
Why are you saying such old-fashioned words?

810
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Old?

811
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,700
What old?

812
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
I just want to sit next to you.

813
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
Let's go together next year.

814
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
I won!

815
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,700
That's great, Tiao Tiao.

816
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,700
I'm so sorry.

817
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,700
I'm sorry.

818
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,700
I'm sorry.

819
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,700
I'm sorry.

820
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,700
The hospital is short of people.

821
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,700
He's a senior.

822
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,700
He needs to go to work.

823
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,700
He needs to go home.

824
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,700
I'll send the driver

825
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,700
to the next corner.

826
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
I'll take the road.

827
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,700
I'll take it.

828
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,700
Okay.

829
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,700
Let's eat.

830
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,700
Let's eat.

831
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,700
Tiao Tiao, do you want to eat fish?

832
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,700
Yes.

833
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,700
My parents.

834
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,700
Dad, mom. Happy New Year.

835
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,700
Uncle, auntie, happy New Year.

836
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,700
Happy New Year.

837
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,700
Happy New Year.

838
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,700
Happy New Year.

839
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,700
Happy New Year.

840
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,700
Happy New Year.

841
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
Happy New Year.

842
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Happy New Year.

843
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Happy New Year.

844
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,700
Happy New Year.

845
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Dear dad, dear mom,

846
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,700
Kai Xi and Chen Mian

847
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,700
wish you all the best in the new year.

848
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Thank you for your hard work.

849
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
Uncle, you're so polite.

850
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,700
I should have done this.

851
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,700
As long as you're healthy,

852
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,700
we'll be fine.

853
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,700
Thank you.

854
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
Thank you.

855
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,700
Wish you all the best.

856
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,700
Take care.

857
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,700
Let's have a toast.

858
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,700
Come on.

859
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Hello, uncle.

860
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,700
Happy New Year.

861
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,700
Happy New Year.

862
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,700
Happy New Year.

863
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Happy New Year.

864
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,700
Happy New Year.

865
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,700
Happy New Year.

866
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,700
Happy New Year.

867
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Happy New Year.

868
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Come on.

869
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,700
Come on, dad.

870
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,700
Come on, mom.

871
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Come on, son.

872
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Happy New Year.

873
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,700
Son.

874
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,700
Try this sour soup.

875
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,700
It's delicious.

876
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,700
Okay, dad.

877
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,700
I'll try it.

878
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,700
Dad, I'm sorry.

879
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,700
I'll pick up the phone.

880
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,700
You guys eat first.

881
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,700
Eat first.

882
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,700
Hello.

883
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,700
Did you bring the house in?

884
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
I can't bring it in.

885
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,700
Then you can find the old man.

886
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,700
The old man is also on fire.

887
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,700
Then think about it.

888
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,700
Come on.

889
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,700
The special chef of the famous dishes.

890
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,700
Some dumplings.

891
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,700
Here.

892
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
I'll let you think of a way.

893
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,700
I know.

894
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,700
Have a taste.

895
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,700
Here.

896
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Here.

897
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,700
Be careful.

898
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,700
Be careful.

899
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
Are you tired?

900
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,700
Here.

901
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,700
Hang it here.

902
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,700
I'll take it later.

903
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,700
I'll send it if I don't have to.

904
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,700
We'll do it together.

905
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,700
It's weird.

906
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,700
Why didn't you go to the park?

907
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,700
I signed up, but I didn't pick it up.

908
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,700
I was afraid I'd embarrass him.

909
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,700
Then you have to keep working hard.

910
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,700
Little Huang.

911
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,700
Let's do it together.

912
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,700
Luo.

913
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,700
Who's your classmate?

914
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,700
You're not in the same class.

915
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,700
I'm not.

916
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,700
My brother and I are in the same class.

917
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,700
Okay.

918
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,700
Eat while it's hot.

919
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,700
The top is dumplings.

920
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,700
The bottom is soup.

921
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
The dumplings are just put in.

922
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
Take it and eat.

923
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,700
It's hot.

924
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,700
Take it and eat.

925
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,700
It's hot.

926
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,700
I'll go first.

927
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,700
Luo Man.

928
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,700
Happy New Year.

929
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,700
Congratulations.

930
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,700
Happy New Year.

931
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,700
Happy New Year.

932
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,700
Happy New Year.

933
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,700
Happy New Year.

934
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,700
Happy New Year.

935
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Happy New Year.
