00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,914
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:40,853
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,010
Lu!

4
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,036
It was our ambition to rebuild the empire.

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,515
However, your wife and children were innocent

6
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,836
but they had to die for our ambition.

7
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,516
I've let you down

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,676
and I've let them down even more.

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,635
I can't pay respects to you in the open

10
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,356
so I'm using this wine

11
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,956
to repay your ambition.

12
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,623
Young Master, His Majesty's secret letter has been sent to Hedong.

13
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,797
Everyone from Huanyun Pavilion has retreated to the side house

14
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,920
at the southern district's hillside according to your order.

15
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,060
Tell Miss Yun

16
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,730
to send all shadow guards who have parents, wives, and children away

17
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,276
before the Spring Examination

18
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:08,681
and make arrangements for them.

19
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,425
Yes.

20
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,737
Young Master.

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,573
Vice Minister Lu and you are two different people.

22
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,475
The examination plan has long been planned.

23
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,715
Nothing will go wrong.

24
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,315
Is Mu Dan in the residence?

25
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,315
Have you thought it through?

26
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,218
I have.

27
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,595
We part ways

28
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,796
and give each other freedom.

29
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,010
The Young Master has made his decision.

30
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,796
He knows he shouldn't waste your time any longer.

31
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,715
Before you move out of Jiang Residence,

32
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,356
Young Master will not return.

33
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,755
What he is planning will begin soon, right?

34
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,716
He is afraid that it'll bring harm to everyone

35
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,716
so he is forcing me to leave.

36
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,440
Young Master wishes Madam He

37
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,635
a prosperous business and happiness for the rest of your life.

38
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,579
Farewell.

39
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:07,424
This half-wet red clay

40
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:10,320
can only be found on the hillside of the southern district.

41
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:22,538
Stop.

42
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:26,242
Continue.

43
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,216
Faster.

44
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,759
Young Master, we found a beggar acting sneakily in the mountains.

45
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,236
We wonder if he is King Ning's spy.

46
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,013
- Bring him here.   - Yes!

47
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,741
Move.

48
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,264
Madam He.

49
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,036
There are spies assigned to every checkpoint here.

50
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,395
If they thought you were King Ning's spy and shot at you,

51
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,635
you'd die an innocent death.

52
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:14,365
In the future,

53
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,716
don't do something so dangerous again.

54
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,676
Thankfully, I came here today.

55
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:38,267
Otherwise, I would never find out

56
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,796
that the people in your courtyard were never shadow guards

57
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,476
but warriors who were prepared to die.

58
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,676
All of them disregarded their lives.

59
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,339
I...

60
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,755
I'm not here to stop you.

61
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,395
I only came here to get an answer.

62
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,476
However, when I saw all these,

63
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,356
I've gotten my answer.

64
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,380
Jiang Chang Yang,

65
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,356
I've never experienced your past

66
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,435
and have never stood in your position.

67
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,116
I've also never experienced the burden you carry.

68
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,075
However, if I have feelings for you,

69
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,635
even if I disagree with your decision,

70
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,356
I will still respect the choice you make.

71
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,839
Don't worry.

72
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,275
I will sign the divorce letter.

73
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,875
Just ask Chuan Yu to retrieve it.

74
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Thank you.

75
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:07,977
Also.

76
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,996
If you need me in the plan

77
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,079
you and His Majesty came up with,

78
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,196
just let me know.

79
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:19,166
Don't worry.

80
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,755
I'm not doing this because of our relationship.

81
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,436
I only do it because I am the shop owner of Wuyong Clinic.

82
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,697
All right.

83
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:45,427
I'm leaving.

84
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,996
When you first received this hairstick,

85
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,555
it was already broken.

86
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,635
Perhaps the ending

87
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,116
was already predestined at that time.

88
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:11,966
(Jiang Chang Yang, He Wei Fang)

89
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,817
Mu Dan.

90
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,926
Have you prepared the stock list for the flower boat parade? Show me.

91
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,501
Mu Dan.

92
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,679
The flower boat parade is near.

93
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,160
This is a big day

94
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
for Blooming Abode and Wuyong Clinic.

95
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,476
There can be no mistakes.

96
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,436
I need to read it carefully.

97
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,755
After the parade,

98
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,915
Wuyong Clinic and Blooming Abode's flower boat

99
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,275
will go south

100
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:00,125
to treat patients and provide them with medicine.

101
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,155
Madam He will also travel south with the boats

102
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,836
to open a branch in the south.

103
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,275
This has always been the thing she wants to do.

104
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,675
They will stop at every place.

105
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,275
When she returns,

106
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,436
The issue at the imperial court

107
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,635
will be over.

108
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,356
But I heard the employees say

109
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,875
Madam He took everything with her.

110
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,608
She hasn't planned when she would return.

111
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,356
She might stay in the south to take care of the branch.

112
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,903
She might also travel around

113
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,020
after the branch is opened.

114
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,115
Young Master,

115
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,795
after this,

116
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,956
you might not see her again.

117
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,356
She's going far away.

118
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,555
If you regret it in the future,

119
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,116
you might not even find her.

120
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,297
If she stays in Chang'an and something happens to her

121
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,515
I'll feel more than regret.

122
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,755
I'm reluctant to let her go

123
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,555
but I can't take this risk.

124
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,360
If she can live a free and happy life

125
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,716
somewhere in this world,

126
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,650
it'll be good.

127
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,493
Then,

128
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,716
I'll go and take the divorce letter then.

129
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,316
When the parade is over,

130
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,436
I'll send her off.

131
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,436
I'll get it from her myself.

132
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,241
Come and take a look!

133
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,755
Lv's Flower Shop

134
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,956
thanks everyone for your patronage over the year.

135
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,635
Let's hope this year's flowers

136
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,360
will bloom better than in previous years.

137
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,799
All right!

138
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,840
Please support us and look around.

139
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,275
All right!

(Blooming Abode, Wuyong Clinic)

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,719
Great!

142
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,596
Great!

143
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,596
Blooming Abode can have a steady foothold in Chang'an

144
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,716
because of your patronage.

145
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,875
The newly established Wuyong Clinic

146
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,444
uses flowers as medicinal ingredients

147
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,795
to treat patients.

148
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,875
I hope its reputation will also be spread around.

149
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
On this flower boat today,

150
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,066
we've prepared Camellia and Goji Berry Wine

151
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,103
that helps get rid of cold and improve blood circulation.

152
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,539
Please come and taste it

153
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,479
to celebrate this occasion together!

154
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,635
Great!

155
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,760
Everyone, serve yourself.

156
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,515
All right!

(Wuyong Clinic)

159
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,239
Flower Water!

160
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,075
Take a look at our Flower Water!

161
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:17,075
- Flower Water!   - Blooming Abode's Camellia Wine is sweet.

162

Flower seeds!

163
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,996
Flower seeds of all colors!

164
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,325
This is for you.

165
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,413
- Thank you.   - Take care.

166
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,679
- Take care.   - Flower seeds of all colors!

167
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,377
The more you buy, the more free items you get!

168

Petal fragrance pouches!

169
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,716
While stocks last!

170
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,075
Petal fragrance pouches!

171
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,476
Mu Dan, Jiang Chang Yang hasn't sent anyone to get the divorce letter.

172
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,493
Why don't I send him a jar of wine to rush him?

173
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,689
It's fine. Just help me pass it to him after I leave.

174
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,332
- Sure.   - Madam He.

175
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,332
- A pack of medicated plaster.   - Sure.

176
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,801
Our medicated plasters and rheumatism plasters are ten wen cheaper.

177
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:55,400
I remember you used to use this.

178
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,253
- Why don't you keep a few packs at home?   - Sure.

179
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,719
Give me five packs of each of these.

180
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,584
- Sure.   - Liu Lang, go and get the items.

181
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,762
All right.

182
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,052
Thank you.

183
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,755
Your wine.

Fireworks?

185
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,156
Are you saying

186
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,115
that if I encounter any danger next time,

187
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,876
you will rush to my side

188
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,515
when you see the fireworks in the sky?

189
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,315
Don't be sad.

190
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,156
You can

191
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,275
just start over again.

192
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,138
I'll accompany you.

193
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,676
I am

194
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,561
going to believe you then.

195
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,156
No matter how dearly

196
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,476
you hold the moon in the water in your hands,

197
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,956
it will still flow away slowly.

198
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,355
You are drunk.

199
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,636
It's humid at night.

200
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,716
Go back inside your boat.

201
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,196
I signed the divorce letter.

202
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,320
I hope you live a peaceful life and achieve success in your ambition

203
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
in the future.

204
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,636
I will leave Chang'an tomorrow.

205
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,196
Doing business down south

206
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:42,673
is a good idea.

207
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,960
Attuned to all things

208
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:46,372
and transforming the world.

209
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,280
It's a carefree life.

210
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,916
This is your dream.

211
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,835
You were once my dream as well.

212
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,156
So, I've come

213
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,755
to send you off tonight.

214
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:12,228
Sure.

215
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,075
If you're here to send me off,

216
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:16,381
why don't you have a cup of wine before you leave?

217
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,916
I've prepared the wine.

218
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,236
This is the wine your mother prepared for your wedding.

219
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,075
Our marriage is fake.

220
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,515
Why waste it?

221
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,876
After drinking this wine,

222
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,795
you'll achieve your ambition

223
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,035
and I'll go roam the world.

224
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,281
We will

225
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,315
be separated from each other.

226
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,436
I know what happened to Vice Minister Lu.

227
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,956
I won't let the same thing

228
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,676
happen to you.

229
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,595
They say he had a close relationship with his wife.

230
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,876
But if Mrs. Lu

231
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,755
knew she would face the same danger,

232
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,075
would she still choose to marry Vice Minister Lu and bear his children?

233
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,355
No one knows that

234
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,315
except for Mrs. Lu.

235
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,253
Similarly,

236
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,236
you've never asked me about my opinion.

237
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,199
I cannot be so selfish.

238
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,436
But you can't make a choice for me.

239
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,228
Back in Pei Zhong's side house,

240
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,876
if I had died,

241
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,355
would you regret

242
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,086
not telling me your feelings sooner

243
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,196
and let me die with regret?

244
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,035
People will surely die

245
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,555
but if they die

246
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,476
without hearing the sincere words of the people they love,

247
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,156
they've lived their lives for nothing.

248
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,676
You know how I feel.

249
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,795
I want you to tell me on your own.

250
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,315
Even if we separate tonight

251
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,996
and no longer meet again in our lives,

252
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,275
I will no longer have any regrets.

253
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:34,690
Yes.

254
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,075
I have feelings for you.

255
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,759
I love you more than my own life

256
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,595
so I must make you leave.

257
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,676
I can't accept all the possible situations.

258
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,320
What if I die before you

259
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,636
and make you suffer for life?

260
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,515
What if I can't protect you

261
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
and cause your death?

262
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Do you think

263
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,636
I'm someone who will commit suicide if I lose my husband?

264
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,360
Or do you think I'm weak

265
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,476
and can't protect myself?

266
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,555
Let me tell you.

267
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,196
I dared to choose you as my husband

268
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,100
because I can bear losing you one day.

269
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,916
Wuyong Clinic and Qingshu Pavilion

270
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,759
will travel down south with the fleet

271
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,956
and flourish around the world.

272
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,444
I'm just as determined to save the people as you are.

273
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,196
I can be your support.

274
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,115
We could have a perfect solution.

275
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,035
Why must you give up the happiness we could have

276
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,156
because of unknown terrors?

277
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,555
I heard

278
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,196
your sincere words today.

279
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,292
You may leave.

280
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:12,872
Camilla wine?

281
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,676
You've always been here the whole night.

282
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,778
From now on,

283
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,996
I will always be here.

284
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,595
Madam has finally cleared Young Master's doubts.

285
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,241
What?

286
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:51,679
Your master is the one

287
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:53,035
who's reluctant to let Mu Dan go.

288
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,239
What about traveling to do business?

289
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,396
I'll go in Mu Dan's place.

290
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,996
I've prepared my luggage

291
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,469
to travel with Madam Sun.

292
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,035
I can go out and get experience.

293
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,199
When I'm not around,

294
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,835
all of you must take care of Mu Dan.

295
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,636
Don't let Lord Jiang bully her.

296
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,839
Don't worry.

297
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Enough. Let's eat. All of you have worked hard.

298
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,673
- Let's eat.   - Come on.

299
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:16,964
- This is delicious.   - Liu Lang.

300
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,295
- Have some more meat.   - Thank you.

301
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Jiang Chang Yang.

302
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,431
Jiang Chang Yang.

303
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:04,656
Mu Dan!

304
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,795
Mu Dan, I made you two fertility dumplings.

305
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,493
Quick, taste it.

306
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,034
Da Fu!

307
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:19,735
Where is he?

308
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,799
He...

309
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:24,364
If he dares betray you, I'll destroy the Jiang Residence!

310
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:25,573
Hold this.

311
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,075
Everyone!

312
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,050
Where's Jiang Chang Yang?

313
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:35,893
In the yard.

314
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,616
I've wanted to punch him for a long time.

315
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:45,759
Just wait.

316
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,560
I'll pinch his ankles and choke his neck today.

317
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,035
I'll beat him up.

318
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,897
This...

319
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,075
Has Jiang Chang Yang prepared the items for divorce?

320
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,232
He won't dare.

321
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,916
What are all of you doing?

322
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,996
What are you doing?

323
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,707
Previously,

324
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,445
we agreed that the first to get married is a dog.

325
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,595
I admit my loss now.

326
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,436
Please accept

327
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,595
the prize you won.

328
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,996
There's so much money.

329
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,560
Aren't they married?

330
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,156
Why is he only sending the money now?

331
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,755
If you're back to get money,

332
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,476
why didn't you tell me before you left?

333
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,355
You were sound asleep.

334
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,156
I don't want to wake you up.

335
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,840
I was thinking

336
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,355
that you might be happier

337
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,970
if you woke up and saw all the money.

338
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Stop saying nonsense.

339
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,795
Everyone is here.

340
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:03,721
We should go back.

341
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,574
Let's go.

342
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,035
Let's go. Stop watching. Go.

343
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:21,476
Weren't your assets seized?

344
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,355
Where do you get so much money?

345
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,115
Every corrupt official has a secret stash.

346
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,275
Did you come back just to take money?

347
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,160
I woke up early

348
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,636
and even went to the palace.

349
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,156
I told San Lang about it.

350
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,752
When we get rid of King Ning's gang,

351
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,099
I will be granted a position that allows me to patrol everywhere.

352
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,755
When the time comes, I'll follow you

353
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,196
wherever your shop opens.

354
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:47,486
In the future,

355
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,716
you will never get rid of me even if you want to.

356
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,515
Don't regret it.

357
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,996
I won't regret it

358
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,075
for the sake of the wager.

359
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,676
You brought everyone to Jiang Residence angrily just now.

360
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,275
Did you think I regretted my decision after becoming sober?

361
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,676
I didn't.

362
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,450
Let me ask you.

363
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,653
You purposely tried to scare me, right?

364
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,284
I'm not.

365
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,476
My hands are tired from moving all the money.

366
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,996
Jiang Chang Yang, what are you doing?

367
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,876
Doing this in broad daylight!

368
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:29,160
Put me down.

369
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,092
Put me down! I can walk on my own.

370
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,555
What are you doing?

371
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:44,962
What is it?

372
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,355
If you get angry one day

373
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:57,755
and vent your anger on it again,

374
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,476
there's another half here.

375
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,207
I don't want you to feel regret and sadness

376
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,505
after seeing the hairstick get destroyed when you've calmed down.

377
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,436
I'm not using it to vent my anger.

378
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,356
I saw how you couldn't let go of me

379
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,035
and dared not be with me

380
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,495
so I helped crush your hopes

381
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,400
in case you

382
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,195
see it every night and feel sad.

383
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,836
Yes. You are the most decisive person.

384
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,715
I can't escape from your grasp.

385
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,996
Don't escape again.

386
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,675
Don't push me away

387
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,916
and don't abandon me.

388
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,476
I wasn't being reckless when I was drunk.

389
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:54,195
I will cherish my life even more

390
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:56,276
for your sake.

391
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:16,908
It looks nice.

392
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:45,698
What do you think?

393
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,160
It's exquisite.

394
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,396
Meeting each other isn't difficult.

395
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,115
The feelings for you must be cherished.

396
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,804
I, Jiang Chang Yang, swear in the name of Heaven,

397
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,595
to marry He Wei Fang as my wife.

398
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,276
I will never let her down

399
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,235
forever.

400
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:10,836
There are many people like the fleeting clouds

401
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,996
but they are not who I love.

402
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,996
Time passes quickly.

403
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:17,276
In the future,

404
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,796
whether I suffer

405
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,715
or live a happy life,

406
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,476
I, He Wei Fang,

407
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,316
will not regret

408
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,035
the choice I make today.

409
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,035
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang.

410
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,436
Our wedding was fake previously.

411
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,075
We didn't spend our wedding night.

412
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:56,616
Today,

413
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,515
I purposely asked San Lang

414
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,756
to prepare this pair of candles.

415
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,595
Before the candles finished burning,

416
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,715
none of us can leave this room.

417
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:24,684
(Yangu Inn)

418
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,572
This is it. Yangu Inn. We are finally here.

419
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,386
You're here?

420
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,956
I'm Zhang Qian, a candidate from Yangzhou.

421
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,356
They are Ma Di from Xuanzhou

422
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:39,447
and Luo Ning from Taiyuan.

423
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,640
More than ten candidates from Luoyang stay nearby

424
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,880
so they've already settled down.

425
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,035
Are you Zhang Qian?

426
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,680
I'm lucky enough to read your poems.

427
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,155
Your literary talent is brilliant.

428
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,880
Let me bring everyone inside.

429
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,052
Come. Over here.

430
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,476
This way.

431
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:55,396
Lord Liu, when is the king coming back?

432
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,075
All of us will only be relieved if we see the king today.

433
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,155
Have you seen the current affairs solutions written by the poor students?

434
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,035
The king says that if we continue to disregard them,

435
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,836
it'll be difficult

436
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,155
for children of noble families to achieve success.

437
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:13,088
Everyone,

438
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,276
calm down.

439
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,999
The king is not in the residence

440
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:19,996
because he has gone to think of a solution.

441
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,760
When can there be a solution?

442
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,280
It's not long until the Spring Examination.

443
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,316
Everyone, you can't just rely on the king.

444
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,276
This is about your own children's future after all.

445
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,916
Lord Zhu, you are the Minister of Agriculture.

446
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,276
Isn't it easy for you

447
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,956
to deal with a few poor students?

448
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,756
I manage the granaries

449
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:45,476
and not their exam papers.

450
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,876
The Spring Examination is coming.

451
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,675
It is a good time to study for the exam.

452
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,195
However, it's a pity

453
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,916
that the days are short in spring.

454
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,956
Lanterns have to be lit

455
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,115
at dusk.

456
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:04,652
Then...

457
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,075
Lord Liu, are you saying

458
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,409
that you want Father to stop both markets

459
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:10,920
from selling lantern fuel and cooking oil

460
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,796
so they can't study for the exam?

461
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,840
The Minister of Agriculture's job

462
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,436
is to check the granaries.

463
00:40:16,944 --> 00:40:19,169
It's not going too far to check them

464
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:20,724
until the exam results are released, right?

465
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,353
I've informed the people at the Ministry of Livestock.

466
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,996
From today onward,

467
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,479
every type of poultry and meat

468
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,715
must also be checked.

469
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,756
If they cannot be sold in the east and west markets,

470
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:33,647
they cannot even

471
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,956
process any oil.
