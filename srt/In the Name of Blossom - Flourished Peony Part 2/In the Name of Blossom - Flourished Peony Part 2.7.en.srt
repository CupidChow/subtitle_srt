1
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:38,160
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:40,880
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,342
Excuse me. Is that the rundown house beside the residence?

4
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,663
What rundown house? That's our residence.

5
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:50,960
What's wrong?

6
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,480
Are you two from the Imperial Directorate of Works?

7
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,520
Is the Jiang Residence going through a renovation?

8
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:00,782
Indeed.

9
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,501
Miss Xiao loves pavilions.

10
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:04,396
Princess Royal sent us here to survey the place.

11
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,616
She said she wanted us to demolish the rundown house beside the garden,

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,880
dig a canal, and build a waterside pavilion for Miss Xiao.

13
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,646
This is Flower Bird Envoy's residence, not Miss Xiao's home.

14
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:16,495
How does this concern Jiang Residence?

15
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,176
They've been childhood sweethearts, of similar social standing,

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,695
and the Princess Royal is making the match.

17
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,943
Since we've been sent here, it likely means the marriage is close at hand.

18
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,320
If you'll excuse us.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,103
Looks like our home is about to become a canal.

20
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,520
Mu Dan, don't bother with it.

21
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:43,277
This is a big deal. You should go ask Jiang Chang Yang about it.

22
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:46,102
It's alright, Mu Dan. We can just move back to Fang Garden.

23
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,479
There are many rooms there, and every step is a scenic view.

24
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,383
- And Da Fu and I... - I'm fine, don't worry.

25
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,840
I'll ask them after the birthday celebration.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,720
For now, let's finish these tasks.

27
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Let's go.

28
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,760
We were paid for this. Keep moving.

29
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,640
Mu Dan, your craftsmanship is excellent.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,280
Let's go.

31
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,600
Wait.

32
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,880
Sui Zhi.

33
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Xue Xi.

34
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,539
You're drunk.

35
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm not drunk.

36
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:07,319
There are some things

37
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

38
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,279
Are you willing to listen, Sui Zhi?

39
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,576
(Your robes stir my heart with endless longing.)

40
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,160
This is the poem you taught me.

41
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:38,254
I was young then and didn't understand their meaning.

42
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,960
But now...

43
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,703
I was also young then,

44
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,879
and I didn't mean it that way.

45
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,662
But I've had feelings for you since we were young.

46
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,719
Unfortunately, we were separated by distance.

47
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,022
I thought we had no chance,

48
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,022
so I gave up that idea.

49
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,662
But who knew, I came to Chang'an

50
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,423
and reunited with you.

51
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,640
For my family,

52
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,223
I thought about obeying my parents' wishes and trying with Pei Zhong.

53
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,542
But the closer I got to others, the more I realized I couldn't do it.

54
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,880
The person in my heart

55
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,006
has always been you.

56
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,223
Back then, my mother always wanted a daughter,

57
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,583
so she treated you like her daughter.

58
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,662
I also treated you as my closest kin.

59
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,063
I know you don't feel that way about me.

60
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,543
But if I am to marry, I would rather marry you.

61
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
Although we haven't seen each other for years,

62
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,423
our old familiarity and affection remain.

63
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,423
When I'm with you,

64
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,183
I feel at ease, very comfortable.

65
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,063
I believe you feel the same way.

66
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
Sui Zhi,

67
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:27,609
you'll marry someone sooner or later,

68
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,662
and I am the most suitable candidate.

69
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Xue Xi.

70
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:42,562
I will always be your elder brother,

71
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,544
but I will not marry you.

72
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,439
I don't want to ruin your lifelong happiness.

73
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,382
Let me toast to you.

74
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,662
Happy birthday to you.

75
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,960
May you find someone you love who loves you back.

76
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
May your affections be intertwined.

77
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
May you never part with him.

78
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,680
(Jiang Residence)

79
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,183
I've said this many times.

80
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,662
Princess Royal's orders don't concern my Jiang Residence.

81
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,640
There will be no reconstruction in the back courtyard.

82
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,640
Lord Jiang.

83
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,983
Princess Royal insists on this for Miss Xiao's sake.

84
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,024
You're putting me in a difficult position to report back.

85
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,863
Please convey to Princess Royal that

86
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,703
I stay at Jiang Residence to catch up with an old friend.

87
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,049
Today, I will leave the Residence to clear my head,

88
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:05,460
and upon my return, I will stay at Princess Royal's residence

89
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:06,604
to keep her company.

90
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,063
Understood. Thank you, Miss Xiao.

91
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,720
Farewell.

92
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,080
You're leaving?

93
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,800
Since I'm already in Chang'an,

94
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,303
I want to look around,

95
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
visit scenic spots and temples, and enjoy a hot spring.

96
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,743
Better than being cooped up in this four-walled house.

97
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,960
I don't want to be an unnecessary burden.

98
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,520
Sui Zhi.

99
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,463
I hope you can be true to your heart. Don't let the right person slip away.

100
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,320
- Xue Xi. - Mu Dan.

101
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,343
Are you going on a long journey?

102
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm going to soak in the hot springs at Mount Li.

103
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,943
Sui Zhi has some important matters to attend to.

104
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,423
I hope that when I return, everything will be resolved.

105
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,183
But no matter what, it won't affect our friendship.

106
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,023
That's for sure.

107
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,680
Don't worry. He's got nothing to do with our friendship.

108
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,296
I'll never let you feel embarrassed or caught in the middle,

109
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,782
and certainly not let jealousy or rivalry ruin things.

110
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,703
What are you talking about?

111
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,343
Do you like Sui Zhi?

112
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,360
Xue Xi.

113
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,223
Don't misunderstand.

114
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,757
Jiang Chang Yang and I are just partners.

115
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,983
There's nothing more than that.

116
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,782
Blooming Abode just released some new bath beans and incense.

117
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,902
They'll be perfect for your hot spring trip.

118
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,119
Before you leave the city, come with me to pick some out. It's yours.

119
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,240
- Sure, let's go. - Let's go.

120
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,680
When I received this broken hairpin,

121
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,422
I should have understood how she felt.

122
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,782
But I think Madam He really cares for you.

123
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,583
She sees me as a confidant.

124
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,760
She never said it outright

125
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,096
because she didn't want to ruin the ease of our relationship.

126
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,103
Why should I cause her more trouble?

127
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,400
You're here.

128
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,880
Sit.

129
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,743
For our last supper together, we should enjoy it to the fullest.

130
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
It's not like anything serious happened.

131
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,662
Why is it the last supper?

132
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,520
Fang Garden is undergoing renovations. I have lots of work.

133
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,223
I've been running back and forth nonstop. It's exhausting.

134
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,302
It's much easier to stay in Fang Garden.

135
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Okay.

136
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,423
But this house is empty anyway.

137
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,064
If you're not busy, you can come back anytime.

138
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,920
I won't be back.

139
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,343
Thank you for your care during this time, Lord Jiang.

140
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,303
Our marriage was only for show.

141
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,622
We can't let it get in the way of our real lives.

142
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,060
Since I'm moving out,

143
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,062
Jiang Chang Yang, please write the letter of divorce.

144
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,480
Okay.

145
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,102
If you need any help in the future,

146
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,262
just let me know.

147
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,240
Okay.

148
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,653
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm afraid you're going to lose.

149
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,038
Jiang Chang Yang.

150
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:44,526
From now on, I'm giving this bright moon

151
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,895
back to you.

152
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,536
The oil merchant who trades with the Western Regions said

153
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,342
this is Xuanqing paraffin from Toukhara.

154
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,079
This paraffin is dark and powerful, often used on battlefields.

155
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,742
It's never sold in Chang'an markets,

156
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,079
and ordinary people wouldn't even recognize it.

157
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,183
Since it's used on the battlefield, it must be contraband.

158
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,344
Those who can obtain this must be no ordinary commoners.

159
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,943
But we haven't offended any officials recently.

160
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:29,215
I remember now.

161
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,200
Liu Chang came to Fang Garden recently and bought some beauty supplies.

162
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,144
That must have upset Li You Zhen again.

163
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,840
It's her again?

164
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:41,926
Will she never stop?

165
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,120
She's a princess. How does she have so much time to keep doing harm?

166
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,504
The box delivered that day had sailor's knots.

167
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,913
I heard that recently, a group of pirates has been hired in Chang'an.

168
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,824
They'll do anything for money.

169
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,023
We can start there.

170
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,583
Let's catch the arsonist first.

171
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,040
This time,

172
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:07,225
I'll make sure Li You Zhen is punished for her crimes.

173
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,943
Young Master, if you don't want to write the divorce letter,

174
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,080
just say so.

175
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,342
She was once my employee, now my ally. We have deep ties.

176
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,080
Of course, I have to be very cautious.

177
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,255
If I give her a letter she's not satisfied with and she demands a rewrite,

178
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,519
it'll be even more troublesome.

179
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,461
Miss He is busy with the Fang Garden renovation.

180
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:47,785
Da Fu told me that

181
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,586
you can just send the divorce letter to Fang Garden when it's ready.

182
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,159
There's no need to meet again.

183
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,080
Young Master.

184
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,080
The pirates were already caught?

185
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,696
When I went, someone had already gotten there first,

186
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,880
so I backed off a bit.

187
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,480
Now the pirates are in the back courtyard.

188
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,880
The fact that we could capture you means we're not to be messed with.

189
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,663
Keep your mouth shut, and you'll taste my fists.

190
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,143
I'm sure you know that your crimes are enough to get you hanged,

191
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,400
which is why you think there's no point in confessing.

192
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,142
But what if I told you there's still a way out for you now?

193
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,423
If you're willing to testify and identify the mastermind,

194
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,200
as the victim, I can plead for you for a lighter sentence.

195
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,544
I'm the Flower Bird Envoy. Leave the interrogations to me.

196
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,703
Chuan Yu has plenty of methods to make them cooperate.

197
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,379
Thank you for the offer, Lord Jiang.

198
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,102
But this is something I'd prefer to investigate myself.

199
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,744
Lord Jiang, you've already helped me so much.

200
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,840
I can't trouble you any further.

201
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,640
Da Fu.

202
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:16,824
Come.

203
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,520
- Come with us. - Come with us.

204
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,040
I can't believe you caught the pirates before me.

205
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,703
Princess mostly stays indoors.

206
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,383
How would she know about this banned paraffin?

207
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,582
There's only one way she could have gotten this.

208
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
King Ning.

209
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,543
You're here for King Ning.

210
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,400
King Ning is secretly hoarding military supplies. It is a serious matter.

211
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:11,463
Anyone who investigates him risks being implicated themselves.

212
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,200
Let me take custody of the culprits.

213
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,022
I can hand them over to you.

214
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,903
But Li You Zhen was willing to destroy

215
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
all of Fang Garden just to kill me.

216
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,642
So many innocent people were hurt.

217
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
The gardener who was the most seriously injured still can't get out of bed.

218
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,703
Everyone's hard work was ruined overnight.

219
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,943
I must give everyone an answer.

220
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,841
Even if the person behind this is someone you can't afford to offend,

221
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,575
are you still determined to get revenge?

222
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,639
Yes.

223
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,824
I already have the witnesses now.

224
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,480
As for physical evidence,

225
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:55,423
I'm sure you've already found where the rest of the paraffin is hidden.

226
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,360
Do you think finding the paraffin

227
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,160
will be enough to make the Princess confess and face justice?

228
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,103
As long as King Ning remains in power, she'll be protected.

229
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,120
She's royalty, and I'm just a merchant.

230
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,703
That's why I've been enduring and seeking compromise.

231
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,440
But this time,

232
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,357
she didn't just burn down my garden.

233
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:23,918
She destroyed our home.

234
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Even if I have to bring evidence and beat the drum to petition the Emperor,

235
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,782
or set a trap to lure her in,

236
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,262
I must make her pay for what she's done.

237
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,784
Even if it means mutual destruction, I have no regrets.

238
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,543
I knew you would choose this path.

239
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,342
So, you're not here to stop me?

240
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,639
You want to punish Li You Zhen,

241
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,800
and I want to get rid of King Ning's paraffin.

242
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
Actually, our goals align.

243
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,503
In that case, let's cooperate again,

244
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,360
just like what we did for the millet case.

245
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,543
(King Ning's private vault is in the east of the city.)

246
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,400
(It holds all sorts of rare treasures and secret items.)

247
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:34,806
(Illegal weapons and Xuanqing paraffin are also hidden there.)

248
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,656
(The private vault is heavily guarded.)

249
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,519
(Even with excellent light-body martial art, it's difficult to infiltrate.)

250
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:44,526
(But I planted my man among the servants delivering military equipment.)

251
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:47,240
(Now is the perfect time to use him.)

252
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,960
Yes.

253
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:07,845
Lift.

254
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,520
Slow down.

255
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,400
Wait.

256
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,542
- Vault Head. - Have these been inspected?

257
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Yes.

258
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,262
This batch of weapons is even better than the last one.

259
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
Indeed.

260
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Very good.

261
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,966
Vault Head, these are specially made weapons.

262
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,260
They are extremely valuable.

263
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,873
Please be careful not to damage anything.

264
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:08,239
Although this crossbow is light,

265
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,623
it can pierce copper and break iron.

266
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,542
It's truly impressive.

267
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,383
I wonder when I'll get to use it.

268
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
Let them through.

269
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,742
King Ning is truly bold

270
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,582
to store these weapons in the vault.

271
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,959
Doesn't he fear others discovering them?

272
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,360
Who would dare investigate his private vault?

273
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,703
Hiding in plain sight is actually the safest.

274
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
Wait a moment.

275
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,062
- What's wrong? - I lost my bracelet.

276
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,937
This place is dangerous, and the room is dark.

277
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,457
If the item won't expose your identity,

278
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:35,176
don't look for it to avoid injuring yourself.

279
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,223
No, it's clearly a woman's item.

280
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,120
If someone finds it, it'll raise suspicion.

281
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Thank you.

282
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,032
(During the shift change of the guards, )

283
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,017
(we'll have the time it takes for three incense sticks to burn.)

284
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,961
(There are over 100 rooms in this private vault. We'll need to split up.)

285
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,226
That's the upper air outlet.

286
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,347
The paraffin is flammable. They won't put it there.

287
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:47,542
And this is the only place they placed a water tank.

288
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,080
Let's go.

289
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,672
You're afraid of fire. I'll do it.

290
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm fine now.

291
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,580
Don't worry.

292
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,359
Aren't you not afraid of fire anymore?

293
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,622
They burned your wife's garden,

294
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,863
so you burned her father's private vault.

295
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,662
You and Mu Dan's tit-for-tat personalities really are a perfect match.

296
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,502
I did it for you.

297
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,896
King Ning hoarded paraffin oil and manufactured weapons in secret.

298
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,383
If I don't burn it now,

299
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,623
next time this fire might engulf your Daming Palace.

300
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,800
Here comes the news.

301
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:44,071
Your Majesty.

302
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,920
Your Majesty.

303
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:49,766
Flower Bird Envoy.

304
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,783
Your Majesty, there was chaos in court this morning.

305
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,197
Last night, King Ning's private vault caught fire and burned all night.

306
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,141
The flames were only put out by dawn.

307
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:01,189
The citizens are panicking.

308
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,303
They have gathered at Jingzhao Fu, demanding answers.

309
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,760
The Ministry of Revenue also sent their men to investigate.

310
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,296
My brother's private vault is surrounded by tall walls

311
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,377
and is an independent building.

312
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,961
How could the fire reach the commoners?

313
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,702
Your Majesty, although no people were harmed,

314
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,783
this is the second fire in a month.

315
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,956
People are worried the capital's fire safety is inadequate.

316
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,423
They are afraid their homes might be next.

317
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,693
The people are overreacting.

318
00:35:33,774 --> 00:35:35,854
What's the Ministry of Revenue getting involved for?

319
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,582
Are they too fond of working?

320
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,943
Am I paying them too much?

321
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,662
Let Magistrate Ren take care of it.

322
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,920
Your Majesty, this matter...

323
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,542
This matter also involves Flower Bird Envoy's wife.

324
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,423
Flower Bird Envoy's wife also went to Jingzhao Fu.

325
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,943
She said her garden was burned down the last time.

326
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,142
Consort Shu also sent a message,

327
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:06,757
saying that the sleep-inducing sachets she ordered from Fang Garden

328
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:08,200
were all burned.

329
00:36:08,304 --> 00:36:10,344
She ordered Magistrate Ren to find out the culprit.

330
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,617
Ling Ge also asked about it?

331
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:15,841
Yes.

332
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,800
Your Majesty.

333
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,542
My garden alone wouldn't be an issue.

334
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,423
But now, a minister's residence, a royal's private vault,

335
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
and even the Consort Shu's items are damaged by the fires.

336
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,680
It's too much of a coincidence.

337
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,182
Could someone be targeting the royal family?

338
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,777
If we don't get to the bottom of this,

339
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,001
who knows

340
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,383
where the next fire will break out.

341
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,263
In my palace?

342
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,560
Summon everyone.

343
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,801
I'll investigate this myself!

344
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:49,872
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,343
Your Majesty, Marquis Wu arrived immediately.

346
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,879
It's just that some of the goods in the vault were special.

347
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:01,307
It took them a long time to extinguish the fire,

348
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,983
hence the public outcry.

349
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,943
What kind of item burns all night?

350
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,542
Is this just an excuse for Lord Ren's incompetence?

351
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:15,656
I haven't even punished you, and you're already shifting blame.

352
00:37:16,352 --> 00:37:17,432
Your Majesty.

353
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,823
Magistrate Ren spoke the truth.

354
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:27,510
The fire wouldn't die because it was burning Xuanqing paraffin.

355
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,702
Brother, why did your vault contain this contraband?

356
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,784
While carrying out my duties,

357
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,581
I discovered a foreign merchant illegally selling the paraffin,

358
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,152
so I confiscated it.

359
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,823
I intended to temporarily store it in the vault

360
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,760
and report it to the Ministry of Revenue soon,

361
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:52,028
but unexpectedly, a fire broke out.

362
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,502
I see.

363
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:59,303
Good thing you caught it early, or it would have caused a great disaster.

364
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,720
Rise.

365
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:06,106
Thank you, Your Majesty.

366
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:11,943
Has all this Xuanqing paraffin been burned up now?

367
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,400
No.

368
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,554
With Marquis Wu's help, we managed to salvage it in time.

369
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,383
We managed to save 50 barrels.

370
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,256
This kind of hazardous material must be transferred to the imperial vaults.

371
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,881
Don't trouble my brother to deliver it again.

372
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:26,945
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,224
My Lord, are you confirmed that all the paraffin was in the vault

374
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:34,988
and none flowed out?

375
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,999
If it fell into the hands of someone with ulterior motives,

376
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,480
I'm afraid...

377
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:41,242
Yes, Brother.

378
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,263
Just thinking about

379
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,142
such dangerous material still hidden somewhere in this city,

380
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,662
how can I sleep peacefully?

381
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,519
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

382
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,357
My vault is tightly guarded.

383
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,062
No outsiders have ever entered.

384
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,383
The imperial city, Your Majesty and the people are all safe.

385
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,239
If that's the case,

386
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,502
why was my beloved concubine's Fang Garden doused with Xuanqing paraffin?

387
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,662
Sui Zhi, you've never seen this paraffin before.

388
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,743
How can you be sure it was this paraffin that burned Fang Garden?

389
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,304
I didn't believe it at first,

390
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,423
but the smell of paraffin on Magistrate Ren

391
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,199
is exactly the same as what I smelled in Fang Garden that day.

392
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,863
The fire in your garden was no accident? It was arson?

393
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,622
How is that related to my brother's paraffin?

394
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,343
What's going on?

395
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,560
Your Majesty.

396
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,784
Someone sent gifts to the garden in my name.

397
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,743
Unexpectedly, the boxes contained paraffin and it set Fang Garden ablaze.

398
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,680
Mu Dan was devastated. She cries with me every day.

399
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,681
She even lost the motivation to manage the shop.

400
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,463
She's my darling.

401
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,109
She's also my breadwinner.

402
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:12,022
If this goes on, I'll be bleeding money daily.

403
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,022
Magistrate Ren has been slow in finding the arsonist.

404
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,055
I had no choice but to investigate it myself.

405
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,879
I caught several pirates who committed arson.

406
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,263
They personally confessed that what they used

407
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,463
was Xuanqing paraffin.

408
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:37,463
My private vault is guarded by three shifts day and night.

409
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,502
How could mere pirates sneak in and steal from it?

410
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,343
Besides, no one reported any theft.

411
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,383
I assume those pirates are just making it up.

412
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,343
They claimed the paraffin was so rare,

413
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,863
so they hid a jar beforehand for later use.

414
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,470
We'll bring them up in a moment.

415
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:02,191
Once we compare the two samples of paraffin, it will all be clear.
