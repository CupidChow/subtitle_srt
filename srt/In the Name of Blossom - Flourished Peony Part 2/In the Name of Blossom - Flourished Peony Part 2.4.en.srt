1
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,960
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,123
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,960
Mu Dan has already sent my servant to the local authorities.

4
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:48,112
But Lian Zhou, she's your foster daughter.

5
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:50,360
I dare not act on my own initiative.

6
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:52,374
After some consideration,

7
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:54,588
it's better for me to send her back.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,983
Lian Zhou acted rashly because she was eager to win your favor.

9
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,183
You won't blame me for failing to teach her properly, will you?

10
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,383
Of course not, My Lord. Please don't take it to heart.

11
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,900
Had the matter not become the talk of the town

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,200
and made it impossible for Lian Zhou to stay in the residence,

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
I wouldn't have come to trouble you with it.

14
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,703
It's not a trouble.

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,462
You're always welcome at my residence.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,742
As for Lian Zhou, it's clear I chose the wrong person.

17
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,240
How about this? On another day,

18
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,157
I'll send another lovely concubine to your residence,

19
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,582
to bring some joy to your household.

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,024
My health isn't as good as it used to be.

21
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,063
Had I not been lacking in strength and neglected Lian Zhou,

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,663
perhaps she wouldn't have done what she did.

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,680
I appreciate the offer, but that's as far as I can take it.

24
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,664
Very well, as you wish.

25
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
By the way,

26
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,422
the position of Minister of Revenue has been vacant for some time now.

27
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,640
The court officials have each been pushing their candidates,

28
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,582
giving His Majesty quite the headache.

29
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,063
Has it gotten any better recently?

30
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,702
It's an important position.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,543
Each day it remains vacant is a day of pain for His Majesty.

32
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,783
Things haven't improved.

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,862
What do you think of Zheng Shou De,

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,103
the governor of Ruzhou?

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,383
Lord Zheng has turned in impressive tax revenues these past few years.

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,702
Many officials in the capital praise his capabilities.

37
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,076
It's clear he's a skilled administrator

38
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,279
who understands the Emperor and cares for the people's needs.

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
Indeed.

40
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:01,992
But unfortunately,

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,543
the road to Chang'an is too far, and the palace steps are steep.

42
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,622
Despite his loyalty, Shou De struggles to catch His Majesty's attention.

43
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,093
Ruzhou is known for its rare stones.

44
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,953
Surely one will catch the Emperor's eye eventually.

45
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
However,

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,824
to ensure such treasures aren't overlooked,

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,943
the items sent to the palace must be carefully chosen.

48
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,193
It's most important that they please His Majesty.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,463
What Shou De is offering will be delivered to your residence later.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,903
I'll trouble you to help him pick out a few pieces.

51
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,422
It's my honor to assist His Majesty and Your Lordship.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,783
The Jiang residence is finally quiet again.

53
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
Thank you.

54
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,543
I just removed two major thorns from your side,

55
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,983
and all I get is a “thank you”? That's a bit stingy.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,160
Then how about 10 more jars of fine wine?

57
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,062
Do you know what people say about me?

58
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,103
They say I fought with Lian Zhou over your favor

59
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,302
and that I bested her in the end.

60
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,182
But what they don't say to my face is that

61
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,742
I'm jealous, cunning, and petty.

62
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,392
I've borne all this infamy for your sake,

63
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,747
and you're only paying me back in 10 jars of wine?

64
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,460
Lian Zhou had been in the residence for quite some time,

65
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,527
so it's justified she was sent away over this matter.

66
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,742
You investigated, laid the groundwork, and reported her to the authorities.

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,302
Everything was done while I was away from Chang'an.

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,663
With you taking the lead in exposing Zhao Cai and

69
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,040
having the authorities act means King Ning won't suspect a thing.

70
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,666
This time, I have to thank you for your thorough planning and help.

71
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,422
You've really solved a problem for me.

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,502
I was just joking. Why are you taking it so seriously?

73
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,103
With our relationship, of course I would go all out for you.

74
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,759
Just add 10 more jars of osmanthus wine and we'll call it even.

75
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Sure.

76
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,343
Lian Zhou's sudden action must've been due to pressure from King Ning.

77
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,182
Luckily, you discovered it beforehand.

78
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,196
Had you been poisoned because of me, I...

79
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,399
Enough.

80
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,023
I'm far too clever to let something like that happen.

81
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,583
Stop imagining the worst.

82
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,359
Alright.

83
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,583
Madam He has always been the cunning one.

84
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,182
When has any trap ever caught you?

85
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,622
I heard Liu Chang, using his position at the Ministry of Revenue,

86
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,983
has been stonewalling all your funds

87
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,422
and secretly suppressing your private businesses.

88
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,960
Is he targeting you because...

89
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,223
Chuan Yu and his loose tongue. He tells Da Fu everything.

90
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,302
Liu Chang's action doesn't even count as suppression.

91
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,742
It's just petty and disgusting.

92
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,320
It's not worth your concern.

93
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,062
Why don't we agree on a secret signal?

94
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,784
If anything strange happens or King Ning makes a sudden move

95
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,663
and you can't reach me, you can leave a sign.

96
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,502
My people will find it.

97
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,862
Sure. Secret schemes are your specialty anyway.

98
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,080
I'll follow your lead.

99
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,783
Normally he just follows the imperial entourage and arranges banquets.

100
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,583
Why was he suddenly assigned to purchasing at Xingqing Palace?

101
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,583
Madam He, have you heard of General Xiao, the governor of Hexi?

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,742
I only know General Xiao is close to King Ning

103
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,663
and has a good reputation among the governors.

104
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,543
General Xiao's eldest daughter recently arrived in Chang'an.

105
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,160
Miss Xiao seems to have made a very good impression on the Princess Royal.

106
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,344
Princess Royal arranged for her to stay at this courtyard.

107
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,077
Miss Xiao grew up with Young Master.

108
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,343
She said Young Master knows her habits and preferences best,

109
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,463
so the Princess Royal entrusted him with this task.

110
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,703
If the Princess Royal likes Miss Xiao,

111
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:31,165
why not keep her close?

112
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,307
Why did she arrange for her to stay here instead?

113
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
Is she trying to matchmake Jiang Chang Yang and Miss Xiao?

114
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:38,812
No.

115
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,862
Miss Xiao was invited to the capital by King Ning.

116
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,583
King Ning values the Xiao family and plans to arrange her marriage

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,463
to strengthen ties with General Xiao.

118
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,039
The groom has already been chosen.

119
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,787
It's Pei Zhong, the Master Commandant from Imperial Guards.

120
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,753
Just finished arranging his daughter's marriage

121
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,580
and now he's meddling in other's marriage.

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,983
Marriages in noble families are always out of their own hands.

123
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,559
Unlike our young master, who enjoys rare freedom.

124
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,583
Cang Lei, what are you doing here?

125
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
Consort Shu.

126
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:41,665
Miss?

127
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,463
So you're Mu Dan?

128
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,520
And you're Miss Xiao?

129
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:50,815
You've met before?

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,502
Miss Xiao once saved my life.

131
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,183
She is my life savior.

132
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,502
What a coincidence.

133
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,703
It seems that Sui Zhi owes you another favor.

134
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,022
Miss Xiao saved me, so the debt is mine.

135
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,902
Saving a life brings blessings to me.

136
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,343
There's no need to talk about favor.

137
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,022
I once said I'd gift you a splash of color.

138
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,782
And now, after all this,

139
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,462
I ended up preparing your flower banquet.

140
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Funny how things come full circle.

141
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,862
Miss, you've been in Chang'an since last year.

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,582
Why haven't we seen you at all?

143
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,520
I came to the capital last year because my grandmother fell seriously ill.

144
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:31,385
I brought her to see Imperial Physician Fu.

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,463
Xue Xi and her grandmother are very close.

146
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
She stayed by her bedside day and night at that time.

147
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,744
There was no time for socializing.

148
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,742
Has your grandmother's condition improved?

149
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,662
Everyone back home had been missing her.

150
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,262
Once she recovered from illness, we went home.

151
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
We came and left in such a hurry.

152
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,382
I didn't even get a chance to share a drink at your wedding with Sui Zhi.

153
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,400
My place...

154
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,303
I have lots of good wine at my place.

155
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,463
Anytime you want a drink or a bite, just come by Fang Garden.

156
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,333
I'll pour you a cup of wine and we can enjoy the flowers together.

157
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:03,534
Sure.

158
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,022
Since you're Sui Zhi's wife, you don't have to be so formal with me.

159
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,382
From now on, just call me Xue Xi.

160
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,502
Alright, Xue Xi.

161
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,343
The noble guests were all full of praise for your floral arrangements.

162
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,902
Consort Shu was especially pleased,

163
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,742
so she specifically ordered me to escort you out of the palace.

164
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Thank you for your trouble.

165
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,686
Please come with me.

166
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,722
Xue Xi is so beautiful.

167
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,063
- Indeed.   - Not as pretty as these flowers.

168
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,400
So nice.

169
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,382
And she's still an unmarried young lady.

170
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,902
Just looking at Xue Xi lifts my mood.

171
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,159
Go on and enjoy yourself.

172
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,502
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

173
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,263
I'm glad you weren't hurt.

174
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,539
Miss.

175
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,233
Your Highness.

176
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,943
This is Xue Xi's first banquet in Chang'an.

177
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,142
Lord Pei, why are you so late?

178
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,303
You're Miss Xiao.

179
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,760
Please forgive me.

180
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,304
My carriage accidentally struck a playful child on my way here.

181
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,787
I took him to the clinic and only left after making sure he was all right.

182
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,223
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Miss Xiao.

183
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,984
How could a banquet be more important than a child's life?

184
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
Lord Pei did nothing wrong. There's no need to apologize.

185
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:57,015
Late?

186
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,103
I'd say Lord Pei arrived at just the right time.

187
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,382
Who else could've caught Xue Xi?

188
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,983
The Princess Royal wishes to match Jiang Chang Yang with Xiao Xue Xi.

189
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,662
They grew up together and share a deep bond.

190
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,742
Even if my father is backing you,

191
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,022
you can't afford to take this lightly.

192
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,022
Years of familiarity may not compare to a single fateful encounter.

193
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,662
I believe in destiny.

194
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,622
And I hope His Lordship believe in me too.

195
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,063
The reeds in the river dispel the summer heat.

196
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,742
The trees by the river bring early coolness.

197
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,742
The water seems to lead to the weaving chamber.

198
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,862
The boat seems to float on the celestial river.

199
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,223
The celestial river stretches endlessly,

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,103
and at dusk, I am leisurely alone.

201
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,520
If you have such leisure, why don't you row yourself?

202
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,676
Da Fu said you spend all day in the shop,

203
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,343
either doing accounts or planting flowers,

204
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,862
and your shoulders ache.

205
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,583
I'm doing this for your own good.

206
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,823
Why did you bring me here?

207
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,542
And why didn't you let Da Fu and Chuan Yu follow us?

208
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,343
Do I need a reason to take you out?

209
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,466
Jiang Chang Yang doesn't,

210
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:35,813
but Flower Bird Envoy never does anything without an agenda.

211
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,022
Isn't that Xue Xi?

212
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,103
I get it now.

213
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,824
So you came here today for Xue Xi.

214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
No wonder.

215
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:03,223
Lord Pei rescued Xue Xi the first time they met.

216
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,063
This wonderful story has spread throughout Chang'an.

217
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Can't sit still, can you?

218
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:11,446
Shouldn't it be Flower Bird Envoy and his beloved concubine

219
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,150
running into Pei and Xiao while boating?

220
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,463
You just won't admit it.

221
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,436
Just admit that you care.

222
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,703
It's not like anyone else is here.

223
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,943
Back in Jiangnan, we were neighbors for a few years.

224
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,423
My mother always wanted a daughter, so she treated Xue Xi like her own.

225
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,117
To me, she's nothing but a little sister.

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,262
Fine.

227
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,397
You two have a clean and proper sibling bond.

228
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
Then there's no harm, is there?

229
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,465
I'll take you straight to the wine tavern now.

230
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,823
Pei Zhong was chosen by King Ning.

231
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,782
If I go and interrupt them,

232
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,622
wouldn't others misunderstand that I'm disrespecting King Ning?

233
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,502
It's not the first time you've been misunderstood.

234
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,782
This concerns your lifelong happiness.

235
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,400
Show some courage. Let's go.

236
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:03,255
I told you, there's nothing romantic between us.

237
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,080
Do you want me to jump in the river to prove my sincerity?

238
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,823
No need to go that far.

239
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,703
Why would you prove your sincerity to me?

240
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,742
But it's really strange.

241
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,533
The sun fills the river now,

242
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:43,573
it's the perfect time to admire the beautiful scenery,

243
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,622
but why are they blocking the view of the scenery?

244
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,463
Unless they weren't here for the view in the first place.

245
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,526
What are you doing?

246
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,313
If we let the tavern folks rescue us now,

247
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,586
it'll look like we weren't the ones who sought them out.

248
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,903
Thanks to your quick response.

249
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,302
My concubine and I didn't fall into the river and catch a chill.

250
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,520
Take it.

251
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,645
Bring me your best wine.

252
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,233
Thank you, Young Master. I'll fetch it right away.

253
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,200
Wait.

254
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:40,423
Sui Zhi, you said there's a Lady Qiu who plays the pipa exceptionally well.

255
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,503
With such beautiful scenery, why not invite her over to entertain us?

256
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Sure.

257
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:49,463
Lady Qiu is currently performing for another guest.

258
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,526
Who dares compete with me for entertainment?

259
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,062
Go tell him that I'll pay for his wine today.

260
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,022
It's Lord Pei from the Imperial Guard.

261
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,822
He specifically requested not to be disturbed before the moon rises.

262
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
Pei Zhong?

263
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,104
Then it's fine. I'll speak to him myself.

264
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,473
He'll certainly let me have Lady Qiu.

265
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,319
Show us the way.

266
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:21,663
Miss Xiao, let me pour you another cup.

267
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,062
I'm not feeling well.

268
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,542
Lord Pei, please summon my maid.

269
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,042
I'll have to take my leave.

270
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,262
The melody hasn't even faded,

271
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,943
and the view is still worth admiring.

272
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,383
Xue Xi, why not

273
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,943
stay a moment longer?

274
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,903
You drugged me.

275
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
Someone...

276
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,983
Hui...

277
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,756
If others see us like this,

278
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,143
even if nothing happened, you'll still have to marry me.

279
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,623
Our match is fated, and we have King Ning's support.

280
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,022
Why will you cause a scandal and bring shame upon the Xiao family?

281
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
What do you think?

282
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,960
Pei Zhong.

283
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,279
The music was just reaching its most melodious part. Why did it stop?

284
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,302
Sui Zhi, why are you here?

285
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,080
My concubine and I almost fell into the water while we were boating.

286
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,083
Luckily, the servant from this wine tavern saved us.

287
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,802
I thought I'd come here for a drink

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,463
and have Lady Qiu from your room play a song for me.

289
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,663
Am I disturbing you, Pei Zhong?

290
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,543
Didn't you tell me this tavern only had clean entertainers?

291
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,280
You tricked me again.

292
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,113
I'm sure Pei Zhong brought the beauty here himself.

293
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,262
Let's see whose daughter she is.

294
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,582
Sui Zhi.

295
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,223
Sui Zhi, don't come in!

296
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,600
Xue Xi?

297
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:39,881
You're bold, Pei Zhong.

298
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:41,762
She's a daughter of the Xiao family.

299
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,506
You're already under consideration for marriage.

300
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:46,027
Why resort to such methods?

301
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,382
We both know who the Princess Royal wants to marry her to.

302
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,383
It's a fair competition, may the best person win.

303
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:04,782
King Ning and I are like family, and I have my concubine by my side.

304
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:07,015
Why would I sabotage your chances?

305
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:12,599
If that's the case, take your concubine and leave.

306
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,463
No wonder King Ning favors you.

307
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,342
Even when caught red-handed, you can still calmly continue with your plans.

308
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,302
Those who achieve great things don't sweat the small details.

309
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,742
Knowing Xiao Xue Xi's temperament,

310
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,040
if she finds herself violated after she regains consciousness,

311
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,533
she will never marry you.

312
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,366
If you think a scandal fuss will force her hand

313
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,506
out of concern for the Xiao family's reputation,

314
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,342
she'll either become a nun or die to prove her innocence.

315
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:43,795
And if the Xiao family loses their beloved daughter…

316
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:48,302
To appease Xiao family's fury, who do you think King Ning

317
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,423
will sacrifice?

318
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,102
Flower Bird Envoy.

319
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,584
Judging by the color, the drug must be wearing off.

320
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,423
If you two hadn't shown up today,

321
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:32,181
I might've been ruined for life.

322
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:37,022
Xue Xi, it's over now.

323
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,000
How can you throw away your entire life

324
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:41,975
just because a beast touched you?

325
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,863
Remember, nothing is more important than your life.

326
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,022
But today, it's not just about me.

327
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,663
Pei Zhong wants to use me to control the entire Xiao family.

328
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,022
If the Xiao family gets entangled with such an evil person,

329
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,102
it'll bring endless trouble.

330
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
I should thank you on behalf of the Xiao family.

331
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,001
Xue Xi.

332
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,863
If my mother were still here, and saw how distant you're being,

333
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,224
she would slap your palm.

334
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,822
Since Pei Zhong didn't succeed, he won't dare spread rumors.

335
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,782
We've passed the worst of it.

336
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,800
I also found out that

337
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,943
it was Pei Zhong's men who broke the swing at the flower banquet.

338
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,920
This man is cunning. Be extra careful around him from now on.

339
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,480
Xue Xi.

340
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,262
Why don't you tell the Princess Royal about this and let her defend you?

341
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,623
If I reject the marriage,

342
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,000
the Xiao family will surely refuse King Ning.

343
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,399
If Pei Zhong is further punished because of me,

344
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,243
it will only offend King Ning.

345
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:10,175
As the daughter of the Xiao family,

346
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,342
I must consider my family's interests.

347
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:22,998
(Jiang Residence)

348
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,663
Pei Zhong is good at disguising himself. How did you know?

349
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,436
On the surface, Pei Zhong appears gentle and calm,

350
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,943
nothing like a typical soldier.

351
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,223
But in private, he enjoys abusing women the most.

352
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,703
The concubines in his residence change every month.

353
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:03,903
The number of women he's abused to death is countless.

354
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,663
Pei Zhong is like an animal. He's so inhumane.

355
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,782
I didn't want to get involved in this and arouse King Ning's suspicion.

356
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,343
But I also couldn't just watch Xue Xi lose her life.

357
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,520
I understand.

358
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:24,720
You couldn't directly warn Xue Xi because

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,553
Pei Zhong is flawless in front of everyone,

360
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,823
and as the Flower Bird Envoy, you shouldn't know such secret affairs.

361
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,022
Don't worry, I'll keep your secret.

362
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,638
If you ever need anything in the future, I'll do everything I can to help,

363
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,439
as long as you promise to keep...

364
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,800
Keep the late-night snacks coming.

365
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
Let's go.

366
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:48,898
Jiang Chang Yang.

367
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,600
I thought...

368
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:56,383
Every time I feel I know you well enough,

369
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,143
I realize you're still hiding even more secrets.

370
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
Are you tired?

371
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:07,647
When you're with someone

372
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,502
who sees your secrets but never asks about them,

373
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,040
how could that be tiring?

374
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,742
The ministers have submitted another petition.

375
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:27,183
They are urging His Majesty to name the Consort Shu's son as Crown Prince.

376
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,064
King Lang is talented and favored by the Emperor.

377
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,102
Consort Shu comes from a military family

378
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,863
and is highly respected among the old ministers.

379
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,502
He's the perfect candidate to rival Your Lordship.

380
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,542
Do you have a counter-strategy?

381
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,800
It's a matter of time before the crown prince is established.

382
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,281
If His Majesty favors King Lang, then let it be.

383
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:10,826
It doesn't matter who is named Crown Prince.

384
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,582
What matters is who raises him.

385
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,064
If Prince Lang is placed under Consort Hui's care,

386
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:22,143
then the Crown Prince will be Your Lordship's Crown Prince.

387
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,000
There's no need to worry about any changes.

388
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,584
Indeed, you've improved.

389
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,143
Good, this matter is entrusted to you.

390
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,560
Yes, My Lord.

391
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,145
Reward them.

392
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,359
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,320
Reward them.

394
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,822
Thank you, Consort Shu.

395
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,839
Sit down.

396
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,542
This pastry seems different from the Jinru cakes we usually eat.

397
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,159
Is there something special about it?

398
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Your Highness.

399
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,582
Princess Royal was worried Lady Xue Xi wasn't used to Chang'an's cuisine,

400
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,822
so Her Highness had me prepare some of her favorite hometown flavors.

401
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,423
Although this pastry isn't precious,

402
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,223
it was made by Xue Xi's favorite shop from her childhood.

403
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,344
It's blended with nine secret spices and has a unique flavor.

404
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,190
It's indeed the taste of childhood.

405
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,302
Your Highness, try it.

406
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,440
Wait.

407
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,463
Consort Shu, the pastry contains cassia bark,

408
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,280
which is incompatible with today's medicinal food.

409
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,273
Perhaps you should eat it another day.

410
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,742
Mu Dan, you are thoughtful.

411
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,640
Cang Lei!

412
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:18,332
Cang Lei!

413
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
- The food is poisoned! Quick, protect Her Highness!   - Cang Lei!

414
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,519
Cang Lei!

415
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,463
This banquet was arranged by Lord Jiang,

416
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,703
and this pastry was also presented by him.

417
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,384
Take down Jiang Chang Yang!

418
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,502
Your Highness, only the plate of Jinru cakes in front of you was poisoned.

419
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,840
The rest are fine.

420
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,264
Lord Jiang has always been meticulous in handling affairs for His Majesty.

421
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,543
How could this happen?

422
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,983
If it was merely an oversight, that's one thing,

423
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,664
but Consort Shu, you must investigate thoroughly.

424
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,703
Someone might have other intentions.

425
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,582
All purchases for Xingqing Palace are overseen by Sui Zhi.

426
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,742
It's possible for him to overlook something.

427
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,943
Many hands touched the plate of Jinru cakes.

428
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,223
Anyone could've tampered with it.

429
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,782
I believe Sui Zhi is unaware.

430
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,782
Consort Shu is right.

431
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,303
Then take these palace servants down and interrogate them.

432
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,264
Under severe torture, someone will surely tell the truth.

433
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,318
Consort Shu, before serving the dishes,

434
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:56,742
I saw Lord Jiang give a few instructions to Shou Zhong outside the kitchen.

435
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,703
But I was too far to hear what they said.

436
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,183
What did Lord Jiang say to you?

437
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,800
He just...

438
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,863
He just told me to watch the steamer and make sure the Jinru cakes

439
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,360
were ready on time.

440
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,943
Lord Jiang never even visits the kitchen for His Majesty's banquets.

441
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,502
Why the special attention this time?

442
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,143
Sui Zhi is close to Xue Xi

443
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,304
and was asked by the Princess Royal to watch over her meals.

444
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,102
It's natural he would be concerned about the Jinru cakes.

445
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,720
Consort Shu,

446
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,920
these gold ingots were found hidden under Eunuch Shou Zhong's pillow.

447
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,583
I didn't realize eunuchs were paid so well.

448
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:45,915
Take this eunuch down.

449
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:49,187
Make sure he doesn't die until we get the truth.

450
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,348
Yes.

451
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:54,532
My lord, please save me. You can't just stand by and watch me die.

452
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:55,906
Please save me!

453
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,503
Please save me!

454
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,863
(Father, didn't you always want to win over Jiang Chang Yang?)

455
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,503
Why would you pin the poisoning on him?

456
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,863
That's what I want to know too.

457
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,383
Does Zi Shu have his own agenda with such an arrangement?

458
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,422
A suspicious man has been spotted near the new merchant ship.

459
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,983
This person is elusive, and his identity remains unknown.

460
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,862
According to those who followed him,

461
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,662
the only place this man has been seen twice

462
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,782
was Jiang Chang Yang's Wanguan Hall.

463
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,703
Wanguan Hall is a business place and they never question the clients.

464
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,582
It's not surprising he went there.

465
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,624
My Lord, your great cause leaves no room for error.

466
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,392
If something happens to Jiang Chang Yang,

467
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:53,302
and this person takes action, My Lord can kill two birds with one stone.

468
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,680
If he's not related to Jiang Chang Yang,

469
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,342
My Lord can also step in and rescue Jiang Chang Yang,

470
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,158
earning his favor.

471
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,840
Zi Shu.

472
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,763
Proceed as Zi Shu says.

473
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,222
Don't be willful.

474
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,303
You can't just stand by and watch! Please save me!

475
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,743
This little eunuch is scared out of his wits.

476
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,983
Lord Jiang, do you have nothing to say?

477
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,222
I don't even know him. What can I say?

478
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,502
My husband can enter and exit the palace every day.

479
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,303
If he wanted to kill someone, he could've done it discreetly,

480
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,347
or he could arrange for his subordinates to bribe an eunuch.

481
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,662
Why would he commit murder in plain sight?

482
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,544
And why would he personally collude with an eunuch?

483
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,200
Consort Shu is wise.

484
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,033
Your Highness will surely see through such clumsy framing.

485
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,240
How dare a mere merchant's concubine dares speak before nobles!

486
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,184
It's not your place to criticize those from the Jiang residence.

487
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,622
If my husband truly intended to poison Consort Shu,

488
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,243
why would I, as his concubine,

489
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,823
point out the incompatibility with the medicinal food?

490
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,560
And why would I stop Consort Shu from eating this pastry?

491
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,222
Mu Dan is right.

492
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Sui Zhi is close to His Majesty.

493
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,520
His Majesty cherishes Consort Shu and dotes on King Lang.

494
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,584
Sui Zhi has no reason to poison Consort Shu.

495
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,903
You like gold, don't you?

496
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,343
If you confess who set this up,

497
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,335
I can intercede for you, spare your life,

498
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,802
and give you double the gold ingots.

499
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,080
I don't know anything.

500
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
I believe Sui Zhi.

501
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,624
I will leave this matter to Sui Zhi to investigate thoroughly.

502
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,080
Lord Jiang has not yet been cleared of suspicion.

503
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:57,180
The case should be handled by the Court of of Judicial Review

504
00:35:57,261 --> 00:35:58,387
to show impartiality.

505
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,960
Very well.

506
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,680
Sui Zhi, you may return to your residence first.

507
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,142
Cooperate fully with any inquiries from the Court of Judicial Review.

508
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,863
Consort Shu, before this case is resolved,

509
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,263
how can the suspect be let off easily?

510
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,400
Where would that leave the dignity of the royal family?

511
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:24,349
Just yesterday, when His Majesty checked on King Lang's studies,

512
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,706
he happened to mention that

513
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,304
the law does not favor the noble, nor does the rope bend for the crooked.

514
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,679
As the leading lady of the inner palace,

515
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,903
Your Highness should lead by example.

516
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,663
You mustn't let His Majesty down.

517
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,200
I don't mind spending a few days at the Court of Judicial Review.

518
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:53,882
I trust that Consort Shu and His Majesty will see my innocence.

519
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:22,276
Why are you standing there?

520
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,182
Go fetch a bucket of clean water for my young master.

521
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,823
This cell is filthy.

522
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,662
I need to tidy it up so Young Master can stay here more comfortably.

523
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
Yes.

524
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,264
She Yan is investigating Liu Chang's smuggling activities.

525
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,743
He previously reported being followed after leaving Wanguan Hall.

526
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,583
Now that King Ning has suddenly made a move, he may be suspecting me.

527
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,720
Should I tell She Yan to lay low for a while?

528
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,079
This isn't a suitable spot. Pick a different one.

529
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,480
Yes.

530
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:03,612
This bed...

531
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,840
The bed is on its way, Young Master.

532
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,423
If She Yan completely vanishes and Liu Chang can't find any clues,

533
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,304
he might suspect he's linked to my arrest.

534
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,542
We should turn the tables and use their plan against them.

535
00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:27,433
Please.

536
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,357
Can I... Can I please be allowed to go in for a moment?

537
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,743
No one is allowed to visit.

538
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,222
I know.

539
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,863
I'll just go in for the time it takes an incense stick to burn.

540
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,160
Half an incense stick is fine.

541
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,039
I'll just say a few words to my husband and then leave.

542
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,343
Take this.

543
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:46,568
No means no.

544
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,880
This is the Court of Judicial Review, not a place for you to make a scene.

545
00:38:48,961 --> 00:38:51,521
Are you leaving or not? If not, don't blame me for getting rough.

546
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,200
Mu Dan.

547
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:14,886
Xue Xi.

548
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,182
Mu Dan, you're quite the refined one.

549
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,423
How did you think of sending this?

550
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,184
The cell is bleak, so I want to brighten it up a bit.

551
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:28,313
I also brought him some clothes and food.

552
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,542
How's the investigation going?

553
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,679
The eunuch has already been severely punished,

554
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,542
but he still insists it was Sui Zhi who ordered the poisoning.

555
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,702
Are there no other witnesses?

556
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,582
His Majesty and Consort Shu both believe in Sui Zhi.

557
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,502
The truth will come out in time.

558
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,102
You don't have to worry too much.

559
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,799
It's just that

560
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:50,816
he's never lived in a place like this.

561
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,943
I can only imagine the look of disdain on his face.

562
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,960
Let's go in and take a look.

563
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,383
They said no visitors are allowed in.

564
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,359
I'll take you in.

565
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,783
Princess Royal sent my lady to bring food to the Flower Bird Envoy.

566
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,920
Yes.

567
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:12,041
Lead the way.

568
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,000
- This way, Miss.   - Come.

569
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,263
Do you know who framed you?

570
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,022
I move freely outside the palace. I can help you investigate.

571
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,720
You stopped Consort Shu from eating the poisoned cake.

572
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,303
That alone threw off someone's plan.

573
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,102
Whoever it was must now hate you for interfering.

574
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,142
You can't get involved any further.

575
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,662
But now that you're in here, how could I possibly stand by and do nothing?

576
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,383
I may not be able to act in the palace, but I can do something outside.

577
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,800
I can help you track down the peddler.

578
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,343
Whoever orchestrated this did so meticulously.

579
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,353
They wouldn't have left any trace for you to find.

580
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,600
I have my own way to turn the tables.

581
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,000
While I'm locked up, you must stay hidden in the Jiang residence.

582
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,536
Watch out for Liu Chang and the Princess.
