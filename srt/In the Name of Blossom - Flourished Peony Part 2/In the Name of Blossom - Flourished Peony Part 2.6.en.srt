00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:37,880
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,946
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:55,600
- Go out!   - Madam He, you should go out!

4
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,302
- Madam Tang, quick!   - Quick, get out first!

5
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,520
- Just leave!   - Get out first!

6
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,575
Go and ask for help!

7
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:10,741
Hurry!

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,661
- Madam He, be careful!   - Someone!

9
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:15,360
There's a fire! We need help!

10
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,160
Someone!

11
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,766
Open the gate!

12
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,983
Is anyone there?

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,302
I'll say this one last time.

14
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,691
Get out of my way!

15
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,742
Someone! We need help!

16
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,182
Over my dead body.

17
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,823
Tell them to open the gate!

18
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,791
Open it!

19
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,022
Someone!

20
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,356
Is there anyone who can help us out?

21
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,182
Is anyone there? Someone!

22
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,902
We need help!

23
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,862
Xiang!

24
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,182
Mu Dan, hurry and run!

25
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,558
Quickly!

26
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,703
Xiao Chun.

27
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:36,628
Gui Zi!

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,199
- Hurry and run!   - Quickly!

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,386
Xiao Chun!

30
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,396
Xiao Chun, I'll leave the wounded to you.

31
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,639
- Okay.   - Hurry!

32
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,142
I'm here for you!

33
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,719
- Madam He.   - Man.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,074
Come.

35
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,582
Hurry and leave!

36
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,811
Just leave!

37
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,902
Is there anyone else who can help us out?

38
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Liu Lang, hurry!

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,356
Hurry! We need water!

40
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,800
- We need more water!   - Coming!

41
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,680
- Hurry!   - Hurry and go!

42
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:33,303
Coming!

43
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,382
Get more water!

44
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,663
Drench yourself first!

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,179
Hang in there.

46
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,839
Xiao Chun, where's Mu Dan?

47
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:54,077
Mu Dan is still rescuing the rest.

48
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,663
Zuixiang Pavilion has collapsed! Someone is trapped underneath!

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,502
Hurry! Follow me!

50
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,720
Chuan Yu, Da Fu.

51
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,079
- Go and rescue them.   - Yes, sir.

52
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,206
Tao!

53
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,816
Mu Dan?

54
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,939
Mu Dan?

55
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,978
Mu Dan!

56
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,448
Jiang Chang Yang!

57
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,302
Jiang Chang Yang!

58
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,042
Mu Dan!

59
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,786
San Lang!

60
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,639
San Lang, wake up!

61
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,828
Sui Zhi.

62
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,524
Sister!

63
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,062
Forget about me. Just hurry and leave!

64
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,663
We came here together! We have to leave together!

65
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,463
Sui Zhi, listen to me.

66
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,663
There's something strange about the fire.

67
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,543
I'm afraid the Crown Prince is the cause.

68
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,783
You're his study companion.

69
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,422
You have to ensure his safety.

70
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,622
Listen to me.

71
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,783
Escort him out of the fire. Come back for me after that.

72
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,223
I'll wait for you.

73
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,613
Wait for me.

74
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,274
Wait for me, okay?

75
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,966
San Lang!

76
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,433
Sister!

77
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,838
Jiang Chang Yang!

78
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,282
Jiang Chang Yang!

79
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,186
Jiang Chang Yang!

80
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,062
Jiang Chang Yang! Wake up!

81
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,422
Jiang Chang Yang!

82
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,215
Don't worry. I'm here.

83
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:22,479
The fire won't get to you.

84
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,663
Let's leave together.

85
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,447
Come.

86
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:30,850
Tao!

87
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:35,043
Tao!

88
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,382
Everyone, let's do it together.

89
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,232
Hurry. Let's do it together.

90
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,000
- Use this medicine on her.   - Xiao Chun!

91
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,266
All right.

92
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,130
Tao.

93
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:03,281
Mu Dan!

94
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,080
- Mu Dan?   - Are you okay?

95
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,433
Here, give it to me.

96
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,103
- Here.   - Tao, wake up.

97
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,022
- Madam, are you okay?   - I'm fine.

98
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,463
How's the rest of the place?

99
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,622
The blaze hit Zuixiang Pavilion the hardest. And the peony greenhouse.

100
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,607
Da Fu, we need water.

101
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:17,896
Mu Dan!

102
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,206
You just finished rescuing them. Are you trying to save your flowers?

103
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,879
Of course. We need the peonies there for this year's Blooming Abode.

104
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,277
No matter how precious they are, they aren't as precious as your life.

105
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Jiang Chang Yang, I'll be fine. Let go of me.

106
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,022
Let go of me! I'll be fine!

107
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:34,620
- Mu Dan?   - Mu Dan?

108
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:35,757
- Mu Dan?   - Madam He?

109
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,877
- Mu Dan?   - Madam He?

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,130
Mu Dan?

111
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,403
Mu Dan.

112
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:54,747
You're awake.

113
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:56,983
How is it? Are you still giddy?

114
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,943
Do you feel unwell?

115
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,657
Xiao Chun.

116
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,811
How's everyone?

117
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,330
Everyone's fine.

118
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:09,934
What about Fang Garden?

119
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,742
How's Fang Garden?

120
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,623
You're still injured.

121
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,500
Help me out.

122
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,716
What are you trying to...

123
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,262
How could this be?

124
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,983
How could this be?

125
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,542
The Jingzhao Fu is already investigating the case.

126
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,063
They'll surely give us an answer.

127
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,862
Their investigation isn't good enough.

128
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,103
We have to investigate it ourselves.

129
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,158
The greenhouse.

130
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,773
Xiao Chun, let's check it out.

131
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,997
Let's check the greenhouse out.

132
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,121
Okay.

133
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:04,238
Mu Dan!

134
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:06,919
Mu Dan!

135
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,782
Hurry! Take a look!

136
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,098
I thought the greenhouse was burned to the ground.

137
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,772
How are these flowers here?

138
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,983
Fang Garden was in total chaos that night.

139
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,936
Everyone was busy rescuing the trapped and wounded.

140
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,502
No one had time to rescue the flowers.

141
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,943
But there was one person who shared the same priority as you.

142
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,372
Mu Dan!

143
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,635
- Madam He?   - Mu Dan!

144
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,960
- Madam He?   - Mu Dan?

145
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,416
Mu Dan!

146
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,262
Xiao Chun, look after her.

147
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,473
All right.

148
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,022
For the flowers that were damaged,

149
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,862
Lord Jiang hired a gardener from outside to protect their roots.

150
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,046
They were just transported back.

151
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
I wonder who was the one who said

152
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,027
that one's life was more precious than the flowers?

153
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:40,428
Are you okay?

154
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,022
You've left Fang Garden with the means to rise again.

155
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:52,554
Thank you.

156
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:54,268
Don't mention it...

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,357
Lord Jiang braved the flame time and time again.

158
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,077
The thick smoke entered his lungs.

159
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,142
He should speak less in order to recuperate.

160
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,983
You fear fire.

161
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,583
But you risked your life to save these flowers.

162
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,742
I owe you such a huge favor.

163
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,635
How can I ever repay you now?

164
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,022
Lord Jiang wants to say that he does fear fire.

165
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,183
However, he fears losing his beloved wife in the fire even more.

166
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,076
He fears that you might be upset over the destruction of Fang Garden.

167
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,782
This isn't just any ordinary favor.

168
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,189
This is...

169
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,389
Just leave.

170
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,229
Let's go.

171
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,542
I understand.

172
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,855
You have to put on a show in front of them.

173
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,448
An explosive signal arrow?

174
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,343
Are you trying to tell me

175
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,843
that I should launch it to the sky when I'm in danger

176
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,470
and that you'll come to my rescue when you see it?

177
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,303
Don't be upset.

178
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,984
Don't be upset.

179
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,862
At most, we can start from scratch.

180
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:56,838
I'll be there for you.

181
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,054
If so, I'll take your words seriously.

182
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:35,078
Are you done?

183
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,090
May I leave now?

184
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,022
Are you in a hurry to check on He Wei Fang?

185
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,502
She's not dead. Are you happy now?

186
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,583
What's the point of smashing these things?

187
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,256
Why don't you burn me alive as well?

188
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,181
Just like what you did to Wu Ping Zhi.

189
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,382
Isn't it better for you to find a new husband?

190
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,703
You found out, huh?

191
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,753
So, you detest and avoid me because you think I'm vicious.

192
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,622
For my last marriage, I was like a bird trapped in a cage.

193
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,343
I couldn't escape. That's why I destroyed the cage.

194
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,291
That's why I cherish and love you so much.

195
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,223
I can't bear the weight of your love!

196
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,183
Why must it be me?

197
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,051
I can only obtain freedom by loving you!

198
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,103
You're the only one I seek in life!

199
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,622
But I have to stand there and watch

200
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,423
as you miss and long for He Wei Fang!

201
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,463
What else can I do besides killing her?

202
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,823
What else can I do?

203
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,583
What else can I do?

204
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,919
Li You Zhen, why can't you understand?

205
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,614
Even if He Wei Fang doesn't exist,

206
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:19,439
there's no way I'll fall for you.

207
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,398
But if you kill her,

208
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:31,278
you'll be forcing me to hate you for the rest of my life.

209
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:34,804
I don't understand.

210
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:37,822
Didn't you say that our hearts were bound as one and that we'd never part?

211
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:42,408
Why can't you try to fall for me?

212
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,153
Bound as one?

213
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,725
We already missed out on that opportunity.

214
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,440
What happened after that, even until today,

215
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,926
was just us forcing ourselves to be together.

216
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:55,791
We were just forcing things.

217
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:01,799
If we keep torturing each other like this,

218
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,383
we'll grow resentful toward each other as we grow old.

219
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:08,879
What's the point?

220
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,102
If so, let's be a resentful old couple, then.

221
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:17,319
I'll torture He Wei Fang while you torture me.

222
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,742
Listen, I would rather stay this way forever

223
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,863
than to let go of you.

224
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,872
I can try to be nicer to you

225
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:00,336
so that you'll be less jealous

226
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:02,639
and can suffer less.

227
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:05,296
But there's one condition.

228
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,344
Do not hurt her again.

229
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,034
Are you doing this because you care about her?

230
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,407
Or are you just taking pity on me?

231
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:23,918
Think about it.

232
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,344
I promise you.

233
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,430
Stop living at Taoguang Courtyard.

234
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,590
Come home, okay?

235
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,200
Liu Lang, time to eat.

236
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:38,906
Enough already.

237
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,225
Let's eat first.

238
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,581
Let's go.

239
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,943
- Be careful.   - We need money

240
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,300
to repair everything.

241
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,822
If we repair the courtyard, we won't have enough to repair the house.

242
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,947
Most of the furniture was damaged. We need to buy new ones too.

243
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,355
Madam, why don't we repair the courtyard first?

244
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,143
We can reopen Zuixiang Pavilion next spring.

245
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,183
By then, we can set up a spring banquet. What do you think?

246
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,266
Mu Dan, your considerations are thorough. We'll do as you suggest.

247
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,662
What's with all the vegetarian food?

248
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,423
I already had light food before this.

249
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:15,014
I'm craving roasted lamb now.

250
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:17,175
I'm sure you want to drink as well.

251
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,703
Xiao Chun said you've got several burn wounds, and they're not small.

252
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,582
With this heat, if they fester into boils, it'll be serious.

253
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
Before the wound is fully healed, avoid food like fish, lamb, and...

254
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,262
- Alcohol.   - That's right. No alcohol for you.

255
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,727
I'm so useless.

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,183
Not only could I not rescue Mu Dan, I couldn't even look after myself.

257
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,143
Now, Fang Garden lacks manpower.

258
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,663
But I could only rest and recuperate here.

259
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,158
We have to trouble Madam to cook for us too.

260
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,302
It doesn't matter.

261
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,183
We always had your cooking in the past.

262
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,943
Now, it's time to try my cooking.

263
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,597
That's right. Liu Lang, don't blame yourself.

264
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,726
Liu Lang, try this.

265
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:58,030
Madam, your cooking is getting better and better.

266
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,169
Of course. I've put some crushed lotus leaves into the soup.

267
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,476
It nourishes the lungs.

268
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,742
It's the best for the sick and wounded.

269
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,223
You guys have to drink more of it.

270
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,766
Lord Jiang's throat was damaged from the smoke. It suits him.

271
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,917
Why don't we deliver some of it to him later?

272
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,083
Sure.

273
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,437
- Madam He.   - Chuan Yu.

274
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,301
After His Majesty found out that Lord Jiang was hurt,

275
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,520
he granted him some nourishing softshell turtle soup with lotus seeds.

276
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,494
Lord Jiang was reminded of your injuries. He instructed me to deliver this.

277
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,542
You have to appreciate Lord Jiang's kind intention.

278
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,756
I haven't tried the soup upon making it.

279
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,138
Here, give it to me. I'll drink it.

280
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,289
That won't do.

281
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,126
I mustn't let down your kind intention either.

282
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:46,289
I'll drink both.

283
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,599
How are his injuries? Is he getting better?

284
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,860
He can speak now.

285
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,102
He kept talking about the roasted lamb and liquor you make.

286
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,484
His Majesty sent an imperial physician to monitor him.

287
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,542
He was afraid that he might not recover if he didn't watch his diet.

288
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:00,406
That's right. There's the grill in the pavilion.

289
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,833
And the vats of Taoyao Liquor. I have to keep them away.

290
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,623
If not, the two of them might meet up at midnight and enjoy them in secret.

291
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:07,062
If so, they'll never recover.

292
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:08,196
- Da Fu.   - You should eat first.

293
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,342
Let me help you out.

294
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,298
Eat up.

295
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,328
My Lord,

296
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,302
the worst-burned sections bear clear signs of being soaked in fire oil.

297
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:34,119
I assume it's just like what you've predicted.

298
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,463
The culprits hid the fire oil in the wooden box meant for the meals.

299
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,467
There was plenty of it.

300
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,342
I assume they were trying to reduce Madam He to ashes.

301
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,405
The burn marks are unique.

302
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,556
Especially this crack. It's only possible with an explosion.

303
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:55,000
I assume there's more to the fire oil than meets the eye.

304
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:56,727
Continue your investigation.

305
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:58,347
Yes, My Lord.

306
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,983
Timber, ten strings of cash.

307
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,688
Usually, we roast lamb and enjoy drinking liquor here.

308
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,943
I wonder what he's doing now.

309
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:37,583
His injuries were worse than mine.

310
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,383
I assume he has taken his medicine and fallen asleep.

311
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,869
Forget it.

312
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,889
Six!

313
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:49,590
Five! Seven!

314
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,787
All right. You lose.

315
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,739
- Again!   - Come.

316
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,881
Seven!

317
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,383
- Six!   - This is satisfying.

318
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,903
Flatbread for sale.

319
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:07,880
- Why didn't you invite me?   - I thought you were asleep.

320
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,000
Guys, what would you like?

321
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,975
The meat I serve here is huge in portion and delicious.

322
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,284
Please take a seat.

323
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:17,214
Here's your meat.

324
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:18,437
Come, let me flip them for you.

325
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,516
They'll only smell great if you flip them often.

326
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,703
Let me flip them for you.

327
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,703
The meat does smell delicious.

328
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,623
Why don't we...

329
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,440
This meat is perfectly cooked. It's fat, yet not greasy.

330
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,062
We have to eat up.

331
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,542
The liquor is fragrant with a sweet aftertaste.

332
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,001
We have to finish it.

333
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,062
Luckily, we bumped into each other.

334
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,582
If not, I'm sure we won't be able to stop ourselves.

335
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,507
I think it's easier when both of us have to watch our diet.

336
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:14,302
Precisely. We're enduring this so that we can enjoy them in the future.

337
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,469
Bottoms up.

338
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,279
The greasy smell of the roasted lamb was too strong.

339
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,247
If I return like this,

340
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,542
Da Fu will surely think that I snuck off to steal a bite.

341
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,143
Let me fan you and get rid of the smell, then.

342
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:45,706
Do it harder, then.

343
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,924
Jiang Chang Yang,

344
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,486
most people love full moon.

345
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,782
But I think a crescent moon is better.

346
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,096
Do you know why?

347
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:05,541
Why?

348
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:10,223
Because a crescent moon resembles something.

349
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:13,574
What does it resemble?

350
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,934
It resembles the eyes of a person who loves to smile.

351
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,899
Turn around. I'll fan your back.

352
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,135
Don't hit me, okay?

353
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,743
Don't worry. I know my limits.

354
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:37,406
Will this even work?

355
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:39,086
We'll know when we give it a try.

356
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,360
Scented pouch and accessories for sale.

357
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:54,942
Come and take a look.

358
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,206
20 pots of roses for this jade decoration.

359
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:07,002
Shopkeeper, this is too much of a bargain for you.

360
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,262
Usually, we sell one pot for one string of coin.

361
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,378
What about this?

362
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,623
Why don't you give us one more set of white jade cups?

363
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,885
This...

364
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,408
If it's a deal breaker, we should drop the deal, then.

365
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,582
All right. Deal. I'll wrap them for you.

366
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:25,421
Thank you.

367
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,703
That saved us quite a bit of expense.

368
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:38,755
Da Fu, hand that to me.

369
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,137
That's right.

370
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,062
Flower and birds to fish and bugs.

371
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,923
The jade comb and jade hairpin look like they form a pair.

372
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,319
Are you giving them to Lord Jiang?

373
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,358
- What do you think?   - That'll work.

374
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:02,703
Flower Bird Envoy only receives flawless jade as gifts.

375
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,863
I don't think he'll take a liking to such ordinary white jade.

376
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:07,310
When you love someone, you love everything that comes with them.

377
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,415
He won't care whether or not the jade is flawless.

378
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,440
What's most important is the intention.

379
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:13,958
You're right.

380
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,663
It's just that I've never given him

381
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,742
any official items as a gift usually.

382
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,370
Won't it be strange if I give this to him?

383
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:24,990
Why would it be?

384
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,542
You were always decisive when it came to your business.

385
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,663
But now, you're hesitating. That's even stranger.

386
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,582
Lord Jiang rescued you and your flowers. He's your husband too.

387
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,742
A hairpin is the perfect gift for him.

388
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:46,064
But I need to meet the carpenter who'll repair our courtyard later.

389
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,832
Da Fu, deliver this hairpin

390
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:50,807
to him on my behalf.

391
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,322
All right.

392
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,383
I'm sure Lord Jiang will be elated when he receives this.

393
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,991
Da Fu!

394
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,557
Madam Sun sprained her ankle by accident.

395
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,782
Please go and check on her.

396
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,943
She sprained her ankle? Is it serious? Have you hired a physician?

397
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,623
Xiao Chun is giving her a diagnosis.

398
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,822
As for her condition, I'm not sure how serious it is.

399
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,423
Da Fu, you should go.

400
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,860
- I'll deliver the hairpin for you.   - All right.

401
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,478
- Let's go.   - Oh, by the way,

402
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,822
Liu Lang, when you're there, you must tell Lord Jiang

403
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,557
that Mu Dan chose the hairpin especially for him.

404
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,943
Tell him not to let her down.

405
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,582
Don't worry. I'll deliver the message.

406
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,423
- Thank you.   - Let's go.

407
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,629
Over here.

408
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,339
Mu Dan is stingy usually.

409
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:41,319
But she actually bought me something like this?

410
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,422
Mu Dan was grateful to you for saving the flowers.

411
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,960
This is her token of gratitude.

412
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,582
There are some messages that are inconvenient for her to deliver to you.

413
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,183
She could only use this as a way to express her feelings.

414
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,680
Lord Jiang, you're meticulous and thorough.

415
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:02,320
I'm sure you'll understand what she means.

416
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:10,188
I understand.

417
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,943
(A hairpin is usually seen as a token of love.)

418
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,062
(Since it's broken, that means the relationship is broken.)

419
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,502
(Could it be that she has sensed my feelings for her?)

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,102
(Is she using this to remind me about my boundaries?)

421
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,080
The local authorities haven't located the culprit even until now.

422
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,502
They even said that the fire occurred due to our carelessness.

423
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,383
Even we could tell that there were signs of fire oil from the ruins.

424
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,943
Is Magistrate Ren blind?

425
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,742
We can't put our hopes on the local authorities.

426
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,463
We have no choice but to swallow the grievance for now.

427
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,416
Madam,

428
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,022
take the greasy putty you scraped off earlier

429
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,782
and ask the oil merchant we know.

430
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,831
We have to find out where they come from.

431
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,640
Understood.

432
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,943
Most of the flowers that Lord Jiang had saved are still growing.

433
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,062
Only these flowers didn't survive the fire.

434
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,943
I'll instruct someone to deal with them.

435
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,605
Madam, come here.

436
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,463
Gardener Hu, come quickly.

437
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,090
Look.

438
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,703
It's actually sprouting.

439
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,542
- I can't believe this.   - Yeah.

440
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,502
The soil was already burned.

441
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,222
The branches look like they've wilted.

442
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,502
I thought it didn't survive.

443
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,743
I've tried to grow this new variety so many times.

444
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,328
I never succeeded.

445
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,659
This is truly unexpected.

446
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,463
The fire has gotten rid of all the moisture in the soil

447
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:23,788
and caused it to be fertile.

448
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,062
Now, it suits the new variety.

449
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,303
The branches look wilted,

450
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,783
and the flowers are crimson red.

451
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,391
Why don't we call it

452
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,742
Scorched Bone Crimson Ruby?

453
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,343
- Excellent.   - That's a nice name.

454
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,383
Fang Garden is truly fortunate indeed.

455
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,983
We managed to pull through even after such a calamity.

456
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,090
This is great.

457
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,662
Do you need more tea?

458
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,073
No need for that.

459
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,679
- Mu Dan.   - Xue Xi.

460
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,800
Great timing. I was intending to seek your help.

461
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,662
Hurry and have a seat.

462
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,542
How are you doing? Have you fully recovered?

463
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,823
I've almost fully recovered.

464
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,702
Xue Xi, what do you need?

465
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,384
My birthday is nearing. I wish to celebrate it in the residence.

466
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,383
Mu Dan, can you organize a banquet for me?

467
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,423
A fire broke out at Fang Garden. They require money to repair it.

468
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,102
Luckily, we have generous patrons like Xue Xi supporting the business.

469
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,370
It's the best of both worlds.

470
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,989
Xue Xi, thank you so much. I'll surely do my best.

471
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,582
Mu Dan, what kind of flowers have you brought with you?

472
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,582
Is it wilted?

473
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:40,269
No.

474
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,239
You rescued these flowers.

475
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,863
They sprouted in burned soil.

476
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,904
I've named it Scorched Bone Crimson Ruby.

477
00:35:50,623 --> 00:35:52,247
By next year, it shall bloom.

478
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,847
It'll stand proud upon the branch,

479
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,662
as crimson as the sun.

480
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:02,481
I can witness it personally if I'm still around during next year's spring.

481
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,652
I came here today

482
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,303
to thank you once again.

483
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,463
And, have you received my gift?

484
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,383
It's not that I didn't hesitate at all.

485
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,463
I spent a long time choosing it for you.

486
00:36:39,785 --> 00:36:40,841
You...

487
00:36:42,543 --> 00:36:43,688
Do you understand my intention?

488
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,303
Naturally.

489
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,943
His Majesty has assigned various tasks to me.

490
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,062
I'm afraid I can only return to the residence after the curfew.

491
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,423
As for the reparation of Fang Garden, you need not care about my opinion.

492
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,542
We should work on our own things.

493
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:05,318
If time permits for us to sit and drink again, that will be enough.

494
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,502
All right.

495
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:26,653
Mu Dan.

496
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,630
I already found out that your marriage with him was fake.

497
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,719
There's no need to put on a show in front of me.

498
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:38,548
I don't want you guys to act awkwardly all because I'm here.

499
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,108
Xue Xi is observant and meticulous.

500
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,662
Therefore, I didn't hide it from her.

501
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,022
I believe in her.

502
00:37:51,016 --> 00:37:52,291
Don't worry.

503
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:55,142
I'll surely keep this a secret.

504
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,200
Thank you, Xue Xi.

505
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,631
So, what are you two trying to get at here?

506
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:07,469
If you have anything to say,

507
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,574
you may tell Sui Zhi directly.

508
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,463
I've already said what I wanted to say.

509
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,502
Lord Jiang is intelligent and wise.

510
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,062
I'm sure he understands what I mean.

511
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,795
I have things to attend to in the courtyard. I have to go.

512
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,999
I'll return first.

513
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:57,157
I've made some inquiries.

514
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,463
Lord Jiang was wearing the old hairpin given to him by Miss Xiao long ago.

515
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,943
He wore it for a long time. He didn't have time to change it.

516
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,823
Don't overthink it. Tell him to change it when he gets back.

517
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,303
Here, have some water.

518
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,062
I misunderstood him.

519
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,303
I shouldn't have given him a hairpin out of the blue.

520
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,622
Miss Xiao is an outsider after all.

521
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,920
It's fine that she's holding her birthday celebration at Jiang Residence.

522
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,160
But Lord Jiang actually requested you to hold the banquet for her.

523
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,560
My goodness.

524
00:39:37,662 --> 00:39:38,880
It wasn't him.

525
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:40,480
It was Xue Xi.

526
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,863
Xue Xi gave us a generous sum in order to support our business.

527
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,582
She's paying us 500 strings of coins for her birthday banquet.

528
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,303
That's enough to repair and restore the entire Fang Garden.

529
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:53,429
We have to do our best.

530
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,062
We mustn't let her down.

531
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,927
Da Fu, you mustn't do it like that.

532
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,565
You have to make sure each petal is organized.

533
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,943
Make them look as if they're a carpet.

534
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,863
Look. The gap mustn't be too wide.

535
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,943
These crape myrtles

536
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,222
were brought from Jiangnan at great expense.

537
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,142
They can live a few more days if we keep them in a vase.

538
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,608
But to use them as floor decoration?

539
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,343
That's such a waste.

540
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,800
Do all nobles lead such extravagant lifestyles?

541
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:26,480
You mustn't put it that way.

542
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:29,470
Since we've accepted her job and money,

543
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,000
we have to fulfill her request.

544
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,222
How could you blame the client for wasting precious resources?

545
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,222
Ladies, please take a break.

546
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,622
I brought you guys some drinks.

547
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,012
- Let's go and take a break.   - Okay.

548
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,416
Do you want to have a drink?

549
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,917
Thank you, Madam He. I'll be fine.

550
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,105
All right.

551
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,459
Let's go.

552
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,028
Thank you, Liu Lang.

553
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,062
I heard from Hui.

554
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:05,984
Now, I understand why she requested this many flowers.

555
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:07,286
Miss Xiao is doing this

556
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,863
because she intends to confess to Lord Jiang.

557
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:18,098
That's her business. It's not like Lord Jiang will say yes.

558
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,463
Excuse me. Is that the rundown house beside the residence?

559
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,743
What rundown house? That's our residence.

560
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,228
What's wrong?

561
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,305
Are you two from the Imperial Directorate of Works?

562
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:37,375
Is the Jiang Residence going through a renovation?

563
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,801
Indeed.

564
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,717
Miss Xiang loves pavilions.

565
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,423
Princess Royal sent us here to survey the place.

566
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,757
She said she wanted us to demolish the rundown house beside the garden,

567
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,983
dig a canal, and build a waterside pavilion for Miss Xiao.
