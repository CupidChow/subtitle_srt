00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:41,920
[Episode 2]

2
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,959
You saved my entire family.

3
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,239
I originally thought you did it for justice,
and I was grateful.

4
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,959
I didn't expect that you had known
my daughter for some time.

5
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,439
You even encouraged her
to practice medicine and open a clinic.

6
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,599
If it weren't for a customer of the flower guild
informing me, I would still be in the dark.

7
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,640
Chun's reputation was almost ruined by you.

8
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
We didn't encourage her.
Chun genuinely likes healing and helping others.

9
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,719
Mr. Lv, Chun is very talented
in practicing medicine.

10
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,560
Even Master Doctor Fu
from the Imperial Medical Bureau has praised her.

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,759
If you forcibly keep her at home
and force her to marry and have children,

12
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,960
I'm afraid she will be in pain for a lifetime.

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,879
Marrying is the right path for a woman.

14
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,319
I wholeheartedly want the best for her
and want her to find a good family.

15
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,680
But you indulge her mischief.

16
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,000
You are pushing her into a pit of fire.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,639
You may leave, do not see Chun again.

18
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,279
- See the guests out.
- Yes.

19
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,400
Running the clinic and practicing medicine
are my own ideas, nothing to do with others.

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,519
Master, the betrothal gifts sent by the Hu family
were smashed by my lady. We couldn't stop her.

21
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,040
You were gentle and obedient before.
How did you turn into this?

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,240
It's just that this is my true nature.

23
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,199
Previously, I was afraid of making you upset,
so I pretended to be gentle and decent.

24
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,159
Father, I don't want a blind marriage.
I want to continue practicing medicine.

25
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,400
A woman practicing medicine is looked down upon
and it is seen as a disgrace to feminine virtue.

26
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,319
Respectable families will look down on you.
Do you intend never to marry?

27
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,919
As for a so-called good husband,

28
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,879
if he looks down on me just because I am
a female physician, he isn't worth marrying.

29
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
You can't distinguish right from wrong,
uttering wild words.

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
Just look at you,

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,600
if your mother saw this, she wouldn't
rest in peace even in the afterlife.

32
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,840
May I ask, Father,
was my mother not virtuous enough?

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,960
Where was her happiness?

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,039
Just because of your word that appearing
in public was a disgrace to family values,

35
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,759
- she was confined and died in melancholy.
- Are you blaming me?

36
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,639
Do you know what she truly loved?
Do you know what her ideals and ambitions were?

37
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,439
You buried my mother's life.
Are you now going to bury mine too?

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,599
You love flowers,
so you can make a career out of it.

39
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,759
Why can't Chun do what she loves
just because she's a woman?

40
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,679
Isn't that too tyrannical?

41
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,680
Chun's skillful hands and benevolent heart
make everyone in Huamanzhu respect her.

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,360
The patients she has cured
respect and love her even more.

43
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,879
We were wrong to hide our actions from you.

44
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,279
But there is nothing wrong
with Chun practicing medicine.

45
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,600
Lady He, you deviate from convention.

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,480
You became a concubine for an official.
I can't let my daughter take that path.

47
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,960
Father.

48
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,879
Chun, you've grown up now.

49
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Now that you have friends and confidence,
do you no longer need this family?

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,519
Let me ask you one last time, do you want
to stay and be my daughter

51
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,040
or step out of this door
to pursue your so-called path of medicine?

52
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,999
Can't I really have both?

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
No.

54
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
From now on, the Lv family does not have
an unfilial daughter like you.

55
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,920
My father once said that dandelions
scattered by the wind are unlucky in a home.

56
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,439
Just because I liked them, we planted them anyway.

57
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,079
But he didn't know
that I regarded this as medicine.

58
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,439
I planted it for the roots after the flowers fell,
to treat his throat pain and lung abscess.

59
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,079
But now, the words have come true,
and indeed we are scattered.

60
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,879
Your father only became so stubborn
because he cares too much about you.

61
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,720
Chun, for the next few days,
you should stay at the Fragrance Garden.

62
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,480
Give your father some time,
so he can think it over.

63
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,360
Yes, we'll come back
after Mr. Lv's anger subsides.

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,999
He can't bear to not acknowledge you.

65
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:17,224
[Fragrance Garden]

66
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
Liu Lang has never seen
100 boats set sail together.

67
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,920
I want to take him to broaden his horizons.
You don't mind, do you?

68
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Of course not.

69
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,959
You don't ride horses, do you?
Would you like to share a horse with Chuan Yu?

70
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,999
You can enjoy the bright spring scenery
of Chang'an along the way.

71
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,959
I've always treated you with respect.
Where did I offend you?

72
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,240
What's wrong?

73
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
The Floral Envoy won't let me on this carriage,
sending me off to ride a horse.

74
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,879
Perhaps he thinks I'm too sickly
and fear I'll spread illness.

75
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,400
But how could I possibly ride such a tall horse?
What if I accidentally fall?

76
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,879
Are you so intolerant of me?

77
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Arguing or joking is fine, but falsely accusing me
of endangering your life is not right, is it?

78
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,680
If you want to share the carriage with me,
just say so. Why lie and slander others?

79
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,840
This is not the behavior
of a true and virtuous gentleman.

80
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,879
I know I was wrong.

81
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,280
Since you know you're wrong, shouldn't you
apologize to your brother-in-law?

82
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,519
I'm sorry, I won't do this again in the future.

83
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,319
It's okay.

84
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,960
I will not go to the dock today.

85
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,600
Mu Dan, you and my brother-in-law
should set off now. Don't miss the time.

86
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,360
Alright. Since we've promised you,
how can we break our word?

87
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,519
I'll go with Chuan Yu to get the horse.

88
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,319
Get on the carriage.

89
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,799
Your sister has always been like this.

90
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,320
She explains the principles of dealing with people
and fears you might actually get hurt.

91
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,719
Just ride with us in the same carriage.

92
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,920
No need to thank me. Being a brother-in-law,
it's the right thing to do.

93
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,799
[Rich and Prosperous]
Gourd.

94
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,600
Fragrant sachets.

95
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,640
This river is wide, and the dock is extraordinary.

96
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,039
Pitch-pot for prizes!

97
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,440
Liu Lang, look.

98
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
There's a pitch-pot for prizes stall over there.
Let's go and play together.

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Pitch-pot for prizes!

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,360
My arm strength is insufficient.
I'm sure I'll miss the target, so forget it.

101
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,559
I understand.

102
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,639
I'm a humble servant
while you are Ms. He's younger brother.

103
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,879
You definitely wouldn't want
to play with people like us.

104
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,080
That's not the case, I…

105
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,159
Then you are willing, let's go.

106
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,280
Liu Lang, go play. Give me the stuff.

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Let's go.

108
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
Have fun.

109
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,080
I just said you are not scheming
and you're magnanimous.

110
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,519
Why are you teasing Liu Lang now?

111
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,840
I just gave Chuan Yu a glance.
Chuan Yu used his methods against him.

112
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,240
Your bias is strong. Now you blame me.

113
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,600
Liu Lang is sensitive in nature
and somewhat biased in his actions.

114
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
I actually know all of his little tricks.

115
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,879
But I believe that with careful instruction,
this can be changed.

116
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,679
We are all family,
so naturally, we should be more tolerant.

117
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,279
Why are you arguing with a child?

118
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,759
Okay, it's your good brother.

119
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,120
In the future, I will be more patient
and teach carefully, okay?

120
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,559
Previously, the sailors
represented them in discussions.

121
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,320
Now the letter says it's the bowman
who wants to see me.

122
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,039
I don't know who the other party is.

123
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,520
I don't know if he'll be satisfied
with the gifts I brought.

124
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,559
Come on, make way.

125
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,360
Make way.

126
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Come on, watch your step.

127
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Make way.

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Make way.

129
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,520
What are you looking at?

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
The prosperous scene.

131
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,919
The finest spring tea.

132
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,719
Here it is, please enjoy.

133
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,880
Lady He.

134
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,599
I'll go in.

135
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Please come inside.

136
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,959
You're here.

137
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,840
What does this mean?
My husband is still waiting by the shore.

138
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,599
If he sees that I haven't returned
for a long time, he will definitely cause a scene.

139
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,000
I know your temperament.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,679
If I make any move,
you'll jump into the river to leave.

141
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,760
When does it ever come to him?

142
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,159
Since we're here, why not have a cup of tea?

143
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,240
Let's discuss business before leaving.

144
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,080
What exactly does Prince Ning want to smuggle?

145
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,400
Normal merchant ships can't hold it,
so he needs to privately build such a big ship.

146
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,920
It's snowing in winter,
and the docks are frozen over.

147
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,000
The boatman told me the rules of the ships.

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
When the snow melts and sailing resumes,
the first block of river ice is chiseled away.

149
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
It is kept to brew tea
for the new year's blessings and prayers.

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,839
Wishing for calm seas
and that everything goes well.

151
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,600
I didn't originally believe it.
But since I thought about seeing you today,

152
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,319
I decided to seek some good fortune.

153
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,120
You invited me today, what exactly is it for?

154
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,719
It's been a long time since I last saw you.
Let's reminisce first and talk business later.

155
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,240
After my grand wedding, I made up my mind

156
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,799
to handle my duties well
and achieve political accomplishments.

157
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,600
Then I'll meet you with a new version of myself.

158
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,639
These days I have been dredging silt,
expanding the river channel,

159
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,368
forming a fleet, and expanding navigation.

160
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:18,000
I have won public praise.

161
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,480
It's because I thought of you

162
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,360
that I designated this pier
for both official and civilian use.

163
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,840
A market is open for crew purchases.

164
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,639
Merchants became wealthy,
and the people found convenience.

165
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,280
Today's prosperity is also
due to your contribution.

166
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,919
Congratulations on achieving your past vision,
but these have nothing to do with me.

167
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,520
It wasn't easy for you,
so I hope you will cherish it.

168
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,920
Let's talk about matters related to you.

169
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,719
If you transport goods here, you can be exempt
from taxes and enjoy priority departure rights.

170
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,159
Thank you for the kind offer,
but I cannot accept a reward without merit.

171
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,400
I hope you will treat me
the same as other merchants.

172
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,919
You are indeed still the same old He Wei Fang.

173
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,000
But I am no longer the Liu Chang I used to be.

174
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,359
Now I have nothing but patience
for my goals and the people I seek.

175
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,760
Next year's river ice, I will break it with you
and brew tea together.

176
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,959
We cannot be a couple,
but I hope for a long-lasting companionship.

177
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,639
Abducting concubines
and neglecting husbandly virtues.

178
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,520
If Prince Ning heard your words,
what would he think?

179
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,919
Liu Chang, I originally thought
you would have realized something.

180
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:04,120
I didn't expect that you not only have made
no progress but also still indulge in delusion.

181
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,039
You and I have long been unrelated.

182
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,240
If you act willfully,
it will only harm others and yourself.

183
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,760
I've said my piece.
If there's nothing else, please dock.

184
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,040
Mu Dan, we have a long future ahead of us.

185
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,119
Dock.

186
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,919
Yes.

187
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,839
Mr. Jiang, you seem quite free today.

188
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,319
Accompanying us and waiting here for me.

189
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:44,559
Truly, there is no other purpose?

190
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,919
Liu Chang was meeting with you.
As your husband, shouldn't I watch closely?

191
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,599
Since you knew it was him,
why didn't you tell me in advance?

192
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,279
I only knew this pier was built by him.

193
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:05,279
Who would have thought he would disguise
as a bowman and secretly meet someone else's wife?

194
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,279
Don't talk nonsense.
I didn't have a secret meeting with him.

195
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,200
My relationship with him is innocent.
I was here to discuss business.

196
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,119
You didn't even present the gifts.
Seems the discussion didn't go well.

197
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,480
Just now I happened upon this item in the market.

198
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,759
I heard the mother-of-pearl bracelet
can reflect light.

199
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,559
In the daytime it shows affluence,
and in nights it illuminates beautiful people.

200
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,680
In the future, it will be more convenient for you
to tend flowers and plants at night.

201
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,319
This thing is nice.

202
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,079
Isn't this like a night pearl affordable
and portable by the common people?

203
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,000
This is indeed a business opportunity.

204
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,319
In your mind, there's nothing but business.

205
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,559
Just now you were on the boat, you…

206
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,319
I saw that this fruit wasn't ripe.
Fortunately I didn't eat it.

207
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,799
Sour your mouth off.

208
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,399
He Wei Fang, even His Majesty
never asked me to taste poison, you…

209
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,480
My lord, the merchants appreciate your kindness
and have sent you another batch of tea cakes.

210
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,279
My lord went off duty today and strolled
around the newly opened market at the pier.

211
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,880
Then he returned to the Taoguang Courtyard.

212
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,759
For dinner, he had two pieces of Hu cakes
and a bowl of soup.

213
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,960
He also ate cherries after the meal.

214
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,920
Cherries? He never liked eating this fruit.

215
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,200
But the young servant said
that not only did he eat, he ate a lot.

216
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,400
Maybe this year's cherries are big and sweet,
so he wanted to taste something fresh.

217
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,799
I understand Zi Shu.

218
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,359
He is stubborn, and it's very difficult
to change what he likes or dislikes in his heart.

219
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,159
How could he suddenly change his taste?

220
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,359
After Zi Shu falls asleep,

221
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,079
secretly call over the people who were with him
one by one. I want to interrogate them.

222
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,879
Yes.

223
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,400
Lady Li has made herself very clear.
What are your plans?

224
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,119
Your Highness, Huamanzhu has always conducted
business properly without any errors.

225
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,440
Now, Lady He is on good terms with Consort Shu,
and she is the Floral Envoy's concubine.

226
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,839
I am incompetent
and really don't know how to handle this.

227
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,400
Is it incompetence or unwillingness to handle it?

228
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,200
I dare not.

229
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,039
Your Highness, I heard Mr. Lv's daughter
was incited by He Wei Fang to leave home.

230
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,640
She even exposed herself in her clinic
to diagnose illnesses for people.

231
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,920
He Wei Fang treated the Lv family like this,
yet Mr. Lv can endure it.

232
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,159
I'm afraid it's truly incompetence.

233
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,760
How can the position of guild head
be held by someone incompetent?

234
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,839
When this flower withers,

235
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:12,680
if Huamanzhu is still around,
there's no need for the Lv family to exist.

236
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,400
Your Highness, please allow me to report.

237
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Stop the carriage.

238
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
Who is so presumptuous as to dare ram
into Lady Li's carriage?

239
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I am from the flower guild
and am willing to share Your Highness's worries.

240
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,599
Go and make arrangements properly.

241
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,160
Act cautiously, do not talk unnecessarily.

242
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,559
I understand.

243
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,480
Once this matter is handled well,
this guild will change.

244
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,960
My daughter, you are too wronged.

245
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,599
Everyone.

246
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,519
After taking Qingshuzhai's Yunbin Pill,
Mrs. Wu suddenly died.

247
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,799
Ruthless merchants manufacture
fake medicines, harming lives.

248
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,240
Today, we must give justice to the victim.

249
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,519
Hundreds of Yunbin Pills have been sold
without any incidents.

250
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,960
I took Mrs. Wu's pulse.

251
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,160
Her constitution suits Yunbin Pill.
There would definitely be no problem.

252
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,680
There must be other reasons.

253
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,480
As a woman, how could you understand
medical principles?

254
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,400
You're just being coaxed
by He Wei Fang to do business.

255
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,559
Don't make mistake after mistake.

256
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,799
No.

257
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,359
The real harmful scoundrel is He Wei Fang.
Come out, He Wei Fang!

258
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,599
- Come out!
- Harmful scoundrel!

259
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,559
The harmful scoundrel is He Wei Fang.

260
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,960
The pills in the clinic have absolutely
no problem. I have evidence.

261
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:05,400
Everyone, I know the sale of medicine involves
the health of the people, so we must be cautious.

262
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,319
Every batch of medicine from Qingshuzhai
is sampled and stored in the strongroom.

263
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:15,960
- Yes.
- This is the sample on the day Mrs. Wu bought it.

264
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,440
The strongroom records the dates
of deposit and withdrawal of goods on the slip.

265
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,800
There is a seal on this brocade box,
which can prove that I have never touched it.

266
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,119
I will hand over this box sealed intact
to the authorities for inspection.

267
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,160
This is to prove that there is absolutely
no problem with the pills in our clinic.

268
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Mrs. Wu's death has nothing
to do with Qingshuzhai.

269
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,079
She's willing to let the authorities inspect
the medicine, she must have a clear conscience.

270
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,480
There definitely shouldn't be a problem.

271
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,960
- Yes.
- Better to investigate thoroughly.

272
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,920
Lady He, what is the point
of proving that the pills are harmless?

273
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,799
If the medical skill is poor
and misdiagnosis occurs,

274
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,960
even good medicine can still cause death.

275
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,880
The coroner's report is here, proving
that Mrs. Wu's stomach was extremely weak.

276
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,480
She was severely injured
and died from food consumption.

277
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,400
But her diet was no different from usual,
except she recently bought the Yunbin Pill.

278
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,599
This medicine is the culprit.

279
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:15,240
Do you believe the arguments
of a deceitful merchant, or the words on paper?

280
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,559
Give me back my daughter's life.

281
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,559
Madam.

282
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,799
Calm down.

283
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,119
- This is Yunbin Pill.
- Chun.

284
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,039
The harmful, life-taking medicine cannot be kept.

285
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,200
Don't hit.

286
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,824
You can't go to Qingshuzhai.

287
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:27,920
- Give it back to me.
- Take them away.

288
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,319
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

289
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,799
- What are you doing?
- Go!

290
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,079
This matter has nothing to do with Qingshuzhai.

291
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,440
You've got the wrong person.
It's truly not us who caused this.

292
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Give me back my daughter.

293
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,319
Don't cry, Chun. I'm alright.

294
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,240
Don't worry about me.

295
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,720
Today I dragged you into this, I'm sorry.

296
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,599
If you hadn't helped me open Qingshuzhai,
Cao Yu Ying wouldn't have found this excuse.

297
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:44,359
I just don't know who the person behind him is.
They even bribed the County Magistrate.

298
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,360
We'll know sooner or later.

299
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:56,599
The most important
now is how we prove our innocence.

300
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,359
If I could closely examine Mrs. Wu,
I would certainly know why she died.

301
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:11,879
Unfortunately, being trapped here,
I can't do anything.

302
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:20,520
I don't know if my father has heard about this.
Would he be worried?

303
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:29,359
When people are in distress, the first person
they think of is the one they care about the most.

304
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,760
You were angry with your father before, but now
he is still the one you worry about the most.

305
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,529
Don't cry.

306
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:42,680
After we get out,

307
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,480
you should go home and have a good talk with him.

308
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,319
Don't cry.

309
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,519
Half an incense stick time,
finish speaking and then leave.

310
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,319
Thank you, sir.

311
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
Father.

312
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Go quickly.

313
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
Chun.

314
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,559
Father.

315
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,720
How did you get injured like this?

316
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,400
It was Mu Dan protecting me,
otherwise it would have been worse.

317
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,880
If you had listened to me and stayed home
to marry someone properly,

318
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,079
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

319
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Lady He, you protected my daughter in times
of trouble. I am immensely grateful.

320
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,319
But you women doing business
ultimately caused trouble.

321
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,720
Do you also think that my poor medical skills
caused someone's death?

322
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,400
That's not important.
Rescuing you is what matters most.

323
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,640
This is important.
It's the most important thing for me.

324
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,000
Today's disaster was not caused by my practice.
It was a deliberate frame-up.

325
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,759
I researched the prescription for months.
Hundreds have taken it without adverse effects.

326
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,519
Those patients whom I had never met
were willing to trust my medical skills.

327
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,039
Why is it worthless in your eyes?
Why are you unwilling to trust me?

328
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,160
You are my father, after all.

329
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,960
Chun.

330
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Mr. Lv, it's really not Chun's fault.

331
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,839
It started because of me. I implicated her.

332
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,440
I will definitely find a way
to prove Chun's innocence.

333
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,720
The key to this case now
is whether there is a problem with the medicine.

334
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,839
You are already in such a condition.
How will you prove her innocence?

335
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,440
I told you not to push her into the fire pit.

336
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,480
A woman practicing medicine
will constantly encounter disputes.

337
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,720
Since you are convinced
that my medical practice caused the disaster,

338
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,839
dishonoring the Lv family, in the future,
just consider not having me as a daughter.

339
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,160
Sir, please go back.

340
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,319
It's come to this point,
and you are still so stubborn.

341
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,680
Do you really want to die in prison?

342
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,440
Mr. Lv, can you really bear to let Chun
bear the burden of a murder charge?

343
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,680
Will you let it end like this,
unclear and unresolved?

344
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,200
Calmly think it over.

345
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,640
If we really caused Mrs. Wu's death, why does
County Magistrate not dare to hold a public trial?

346
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,319
Why would he rather violate the law
to use private punishment against us?

347
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,720
Why force us to confess and sign?

348
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,039
Only by clarifying all these issues

349
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,079
can Chun truly be exonerated.

350
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,639
It really can shine at night.
Jiang Chang Yang did not deceive me.

351
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:32,279
In times of trouble, was the first person
I thought of really you?

352
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,680
Chun's father has to bribe all around to come in.

353
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,559
You came in so easily,
indeed deserved to be the Floral Envoy.

354
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,280
The case has not yet been clarified,
yet they dare to torture you.

355
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,960
Who gave the order?

356
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,080
In Chang'an, who is capable
of falsely accusing me of such a great crime?

357
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,800
Who would dare ignore your dignity
and subject me to severe interrogation?

358
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,839
Naturally, it could only be that person.

359
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,279
Where are we going?

360
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,160
Take my concubine away from here.

361
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,240
No, I can't leave with you right now.

362
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,119
Wouldn't it truly make me a profiteer
who relies on official power to take lives?

363
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,919
Someone is putting pressure behind Magistrate.
He won't handle it impartially.

364
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,599
I must thoroughly investigate this case

365
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:08,879
and find irrefutable evidence to bring to trial.

366
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,559
I want Cao Yu Ying
and the County Magistrate to see.

367
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,160
Let the entire city's people
and the person behind this see.

368
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,399
Chun and I will walk out of this cell
with dignity and innocence.

369
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Alright.

370
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,359
However, if I do nothing when my concubine
is in trouble, wouldn't that be suspicious?

371
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,319
You must already have a plan in mind.

372
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,159
If there is anything you need my help with,
just let me know.

373
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,539
Thank you for your righteous support.

374
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:51,640
Although I cannot leave this cell now,

375
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,040
I have already planned all the matters
regarding the investigation.

376
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,573
You just pass a message for me.

377
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:01,958
[Mortuary]

378
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,119
How is it?

379
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,280
Mr. Jiang, Mrs. Wu had previously given birth.

380
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,039
It was not the weak stomach that led to her death.

381
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,599
When she should have been nourished,
she consumed a large amount of toxic cold foods.

382
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,119
This resulted in continuous bleeding,
qi and blood deficiency, leading to death.

383
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:23,496
I'm worried that the county coroner
has been bribed.

384
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:27,960
We changed the person inspecting, but still
could not diagnose the illness. Why is this?

385
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,000
Most coroners are men
and naturally understand common illnesses,

386
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,360
but many women are too embarrassed
to seek treatment when ill.

387
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,599
They haven't seen as many female patients
as we female physicians have.

388
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,079
It is common for them to overlook
the hidden ailments of female corpses.

389
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,920
No wonder Mu Dan asked me to pass a message
to Consort Shu about using a female physician.

390
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,959
Yunbin Pill is mild and harmless. Mrs. Wu
must have died from consuming something else.

391
00:34:53,719 --> 00:35:00,319
I understand. Please convey my gratitude
to Consort Shu upon returning to the palace.

392
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,959
My lord,

393
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,880
Fu has followed Ms. He's arrangements

394
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
and has gathered
all the testimonial and material evidence.

395
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,039
Madam Tang learned from the floriculturist
at the flower guild

396
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,119
that Mrs. Wu was a concubine of Cao Yu Ying
and had been hidden daily in Dingzi Alley.

397
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,679
Cao Yu Ying, not understanding medical principles,
sought a physician at the clinic five days ago,

398
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,639
claiming that his concubine had just given birth
and asked about dietary restrictions.

399
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:37,400
Next, he went to a pharmacy and bought
some cold items forbidden for postpartum women.

400
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Someone in Dingzi Alley saw Cao Yu Ying
carrying crabs and bezoar to Mrs. Wu's house.

401
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,679
The next day, her death was reported.

402
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,920
Fu has obtained testimony from all parties.

403
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,199
There is a purchase receipt from the pharmacy,
and food scraps were found in Mrs. Wu's kitchen.

404
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,920
Tomorrow in court,
Ms. He will surely be able to clear her name.

405
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,839
My lord, rest assured.

406
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,519
To ensure no future troubles,
there is still someone I need to meet with.

407
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:21,720
Why do you have the time to grace
our Prince Ning's Mansion today?

408
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,480
These days, my concubine was framed
and suffered imprisonment.

409
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,039
I was so furious
that I made a scene at the county yamen.

410
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:37,039
However, I unexpectedly found the missing item
from your mansion, so I came to return it.

411
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,800
So, you are here to demand justice.

412
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,239
He Wei Fang caused me to fall from my horse.

413
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:56,600
I didn't kill her, that was already merciful.

414
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:03,879
Your plight invokes sympathy,
but what is done cannot be undone.

415
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,039
Now you have married your beloved as you wished.

416
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,719
His Highness sought justice for you
and promoted Zi Shu to Deputy Transport Officer.

417
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,719
Now he is flourishing like the rising sun,
and His Highness has gained a valuable person.

418
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,879
It can be said that everyone is satisfied
and gets what they wished for.

419
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,560
Why do you keep holding onto my concubine?

420
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:35,680
How can the justice my father sought for me
make up for the heart-wrenching pain I suffered?

421
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,879
I can't say whether it can be made up for or not.

422
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:46,680
But since His Highness promised me at that time,
I have no regrets about the decision.

423
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:50,159
If you insist on regretting the move,

424
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,239
I don't mind being a scoundrel
and making a scene in front of His Majesty.

425
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,479
The position granted can be withdrawn.

426
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,399
What exactly do you want?

427
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,840
You suffered from falling off the horse,
and my concubine was seriously injured in prison.

428
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,960
In my opinion, let's call it even
and put this matter behind us completely.

429
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,480
From now on, I will continue to maintain
a close relationship with His Highness.

430
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,719
However, you and Zi Shu should have
less interaction with us two

431
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,480
so as not to trigger distress.

432
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,400
After all, for you, the most important thing now
is the harmony between the spouses.

433
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,399
What do you think?

434
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,959
Let's do as you say.

435
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,880
Returning the lost item was not easy.

436
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,200
A slightest negligence may result
in losing it again. I hope you will cherish it.

437
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,080
Your Highness, are you really going
to let He Wei Fang go just like that?

438
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,120
Jiang Chang Yang cherishes Lady He so much,
and she has no interest in Zi Shu.

439
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:54,199
It seems that Zi Shu
has no opportunities, let it be.

440
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,720
Yes.

441
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,239
What about Cao Yu Ying?

442
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,800
Rest assured, Your Highness.
He still has a family.

443
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,320
No matter what crime he's convicted of,
he will bear it and won't speak carelessly.

444
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,039
I will handle everything properly.
My lord will not know anything.

445
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,079
Cao Yu Ying poisoned a civilian woman
and framed others.

446
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,639
The evidence is conclusive.
He ought to be executed according to the law.

447
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,880
Execution will take place after autumn.

448
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,199
The two of Qingshuzhai have been verified
innocent and are to be released immediately.

449
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,800
- Great!
- Great!

450
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,720
Animal! Give me back my daughter!

451
