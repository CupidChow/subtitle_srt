1
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,999
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,960
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,103
Fire!

4
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,582
Defend!

5
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,022
Charge!

6
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,917
Kill!

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,702
Fire!

8
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,742
Fire again!

9
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,983
Form ranks!

10
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:05,702
Cavalry, forward!

11
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,959
My Lord.

12
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,422
Looks like

13
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,223
Yu Zheng really inherited
Yu Chang's prowess.

14
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,663
With just 50,000 men,

15
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,583
they've held out this long.

16
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,400
Pour the oil!

17
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,382
Charge!

18
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,040
They deployed over a hundred
crossbowmen the moment the battle began.

19
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,760
The Central Army's fire oil is being
depleted faster than I anticipated.

20
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:17,609
At this rate,

21
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,439
King Ning's fifty barrels of fire oil
will be exhausted before nightfall.

22
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,103
The battlefield is playing
out exactly as you predicted.

23
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,815
Once night falls, we can launch
a surprise attack on their rear

24
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,279
and catch them completely off guard.

25
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Madam.

26
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,143
The Central Army's fire arrows

27
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,175
are more intense and
rapid than we anticipated.

28
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,783
Lord Jiang will lead the
surprise attack tonight.

29
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,703
Looks like everything
hinges on this one strike.

30
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,182
It says here that King
Ning's fire arrow assault

31
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,519
has inflicted heavy
casualties on the Hedong army.

32
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,783
Did Lord Jiang foresee our
disadvantage in open battle

33
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,319
and plan this night attack all along?

34
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,159
No matter how the battle unfolds,

35
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,742
this night assault is inevitable.

36
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
First, capture the leader
to break the enemy.

37
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,103
If Jiang Chang Yang can breach their
camp and seize control of King Ning,

38
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,399
the war could end sooner,

39
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,422
and countless soldiers would
be spared needless bloodshed.

40
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Second,

41
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,663
the Central Army's position
is cleverly positioned,

42
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,519
nestled against the Shuangmang Mountains.

43
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,822
Even if the Hedong army wins the battle,

44
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,223
King Ning could retreat through
the narrow pass between the peaks.

45
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,183
That treacherous terrain
favors defense over attack.

46
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,783
He has prepared an escape route all along.

47
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,549
If he gets back to Chang'an first

48
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,783
and twists the truth before the court,

49
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,520
the consequences will be disastrous.

50
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,799
- Our soldiers can hide in... - Report!

51
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,416
Lord Jiang, the Central Army
has ceased their fire arrow assault.

52
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,252
All the crossbowmen
have been withdrawn.

53
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,239
And their commanders?

54
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,676
The Imperial Guard Commander
and two regional commanders

55
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,815
are still leading the
assault at the front lines.

56
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,103
King Ning has been escorted
to the rearmost position.

57
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:29,919
Perfect timing.

58
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,729
He has left the field
even before nightfall.

59
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,775
Looks like King Ning
is certain of his victory.

60
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,160
Ready the arms and bring my warhorse!

61
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Yes, sir!

62
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
- Muffle the hooves. - Yes, sir!

63
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,780
- Muffle the hooves. - Yes, sir!

64
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Report!

65
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:09,933
- General! - How did it go?

66
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,936
As our light cavalry approached
King Ning's main camp,

67
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,096
they were ambushed by crossbowmen.

68
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,953
Fire oil ignited everywhere,
arrows rained down upon the riders.

69
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,189
Though Lord Jiang reacted swiftly,

70
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,040
raising shields and cutting through arrows,

71
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,303
many soldiers fell, their armors ablaze.

72
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,063
Only a dozen remain.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,142
Did they retreat as planned?

74
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,719
Yes. During withdrawal,

75
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,680
Lord Jiang fired three arrows at King Ning.

76
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,800
The first two were blocked when King
Ning used a soldier as a human shield,

77
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,720
but the last arrow struck
him in the shoulder.

78
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,376
What's King Ning's condition?

79
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,256
I returned as soon as I saw him
retreat back to his main camp.

80
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,680
I couldn't assess his exact injury.

81
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Crossfire never ceased during my return.

82
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,800
I'm afraid the squad won't
make it back anytime soon.

83
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Those behind, stay close!

84
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Young Master, look!

85
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,533
Fall back to camp at full speed!

86
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Water!

87
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
More water!

88
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,080
Get more water! Hurry!

89
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Quick!

90
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,936
Around the third quarter of the Yin hour,

91
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,383
not long after the commander left,

92
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,999
we spotted signal smoke rising
from the rear of the Central Army.

93
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,126
Then, a group of death squads broke in

94
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,783
from the eastern side of the camp.

95
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,342
As you instructed,

96
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,800
we stayed on high alert
even through the night,

97
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,862
doubling the number of guards on watch.

98
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,520
We managed to capture
most of the attackers quickly,

99
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,822
but two of them, seeing
their ambush had failed,

100
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,903
forced their way into the supply tent

101
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,999
and set the rations on fire.

102
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,440
The blaze spread too fast.

103
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,759
By the time we put it out,

104
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,462
nearly all of our stored
provisions were destroyed.

105
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,599
They poisoned themselves?

106
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes. After they were captured,
most swallowed poison.

107
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,462
But we managed to take one alive.

108
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,719
What did you get out of him?

109
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,622
They'd been hiding east of
camp since before the battle.

110
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,320
Since they were few in number

111
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,776
and well-hidden among the trees,

112
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,862
no one ever noticed them.

113
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,742
He said King Ning ordered
them to wait for signal smoke.

114
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,742
When our army was exhausted,

115
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,615
they were to break in and
assassinate our commander.

116
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,213
But...

117
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,982
But our night
assault made King Ning

118
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,263
to change his plan on the fly.

119
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,575
That's why the signal smoke
was lit ahead of time tonight.

120
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,560
They had no choice but to charge in.

121
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,742
Imagine if these death squad had struck

122
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,646
when our morale wavered...

123
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
The damage would've been catastrophic.

124
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,796
Due to King Ning's change of plans,

125
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,462
and our camp was well-guarded,

126
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,216
the danger was cut to a minimum.

127
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,779
The assassination of commander

128
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,762
was supposed to be King Ning's final move.

129
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,480
But now, in his panic,

130
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,984
he's exposed his hidden hand too soon.

131
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,982
This may prove advantageous for us.

132
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Still,

133
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,622
we failed to capture King Ning tonight.

134
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
This war

135
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,360
may drag on longer than we anticipated.

136
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,783
You mustn't blame yourself.

137
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,543
King Ning's panic will ripple
through their main forces.

138
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,143
There's still hope for us.

139
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,023
We had planned for a swift victory.

140
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,183
With our provisions gone,

141
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,215
no matter how brave and
skilled the Hedong soldiers are,

142
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,119
they won't last long
against hunger and cold.

143
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,263
Recount all remaining supplies,

144
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:44,753
see how many days we can hold out.

145
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,561
Starting tomorrow, rations
will be halved for every meal.

146
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,239
No matter what,

147
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,663
we must hold the Dongwei Pass.

148
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,119
Yes, sir!

149
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
(The battle worsens. Leave immediately.)

150
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,423
Madam, Lord Jiang's orders were clear.

151
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,839
If danger comes,

152
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,680
we're to leave Hedong
immediately and sail to Silla.

153
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
The cargo ship awaits at
the dock. We leave tonight.

154
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:27,686
I swear I'll get you out safe and sound.

155
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,119
But if the throne changes
hands and the land falls to ruin,

156
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,462
as citizens of the Tang Empire,

157
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,680
what peace and safety can we claim?

158
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,943
Men need food and horses need fodder.

159
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,663
If this war drags on,

160
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,502
won't the Hedong Army
be driven to desperation?

161
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,080
King Ning has his escape route sorted.

162
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
What about us?

163
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,143
The Hedong camp backs onto the Fan River.

164
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,582
If they lose the battle,

165
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,423
couldn't they just escape by ships?

166
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,183
Yu Zheng and Jiang Chang Yang
aren't cowards who'd abandon the fight.

167
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,800
They'd never flee the battlefield.

168
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,822
Besides, King Ning has labelled
the Hedong army as rebels.

169
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
If they run,

170
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
they'll only confirm the accusation.

171
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,703
And what then of the people of Hedong?

172
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,516
An army ready to die in battle

173
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,704
wouldn't prepare escape ships.

174
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,663
We have cargo ships!

175
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,600
Our vessels can carry
a thousand hu of grain.

176
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,016
If we load them with supplies and
send them to the Hedong army...

177
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,583
You want to cross the Fan River?

178
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,263
But the camp is on the southwest bank.

179
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,423
To cross, we'd have to go upstream.

180
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,960
The Fan River is wide
and the current treacherous.

181
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,936
If we hit hidden rocks or raging currents,

182
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,241
our ship could capsize, and
our bodies never to be found.

183
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,423
But if we can cross successfully

184
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,622
and resupply the Hedong army,

185
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,573
our chances of victory improve.

186
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,622
I'll follow your lead.

187
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,519
I'll start taking stock
of our stored grain.

188
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,519
I'll get the workers to
start loading the cargo.

189
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,119
Wait. That won't be enough.

190
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,879
Miss Yun,

191
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,559
take some men to our shop in Hedong,

192
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:22,599
borrow food from the
people with promissory notes.

193
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,919
Rice, flour, fodder, wild greens,

194
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:25,999
gather whatever you can.

195
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,754
Yes, Madam.

196
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,822
Remember, stamp every
note with our shop's seal.

197
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,303
Promise them tenfold repayment.

198
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Careful.

199
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Madam Feng!

200
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,383
Mr. Yang, what brings you here?

201
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,622
This is my father-in-law's fishing boat.

202
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,063
It's not large, but it can
carry a dozen dan of grain.

203
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,516
Also, with the northern cold

204
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,136
and the soldiers camping in
the open, they're bound to fall ill.

205
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,743
I've brought some medicinal soups and pills

206
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,957
for the Hedong army,

207
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:58,336
just in case.

208
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,877
The Fan River runs treacherous.

209
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,383
I appreciate your kindness,

210
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,943
but please don't take such risks.

211
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
It's no trouble.

212
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,599
Madam Feng!

213
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,776
You drove off the
bandits from Juebei for us,

214
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,960
taught us trade and brought prosperity!

215
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:14,356
Now it's our turn to repay you.

216
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,663
Please don't refuse us.

217
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,862
Besides, Hedong is in crisis.

218
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,796
General Yu is fighting on the front lines.

219
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,997
How can we Hedong folk
just sit by and do nothing?

220
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
That's right!

221
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:26,903
You're the model of
integrity among merchants.

222
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,237
You're not even from Hedong,

223
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,536
yet you would risk your life
to deliver grain for our army.

224
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,455
We have all the more reason to do
our part for the soldiers at the front!

225
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,200
That's right! We'll do our part!

226
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:38,120
In that case...

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,263
Thank you.

228
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,719
Da Fu!

229
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,000
- Load the ship! - Alright!

230
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,839
- Load the ship! - Come on!

231
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,946
Come on, I'll carry some.

232
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,342
This way.
Careful, it's slippery.

233
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,396
Madam Feng, my wife has a
stockpile of pickled vegetables.

234
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,680
We'll send them over shortly.

235
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,680
- Thank you! - Madam Feng, our shop

236
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,016
has a small cargo boat ready too.

237
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,735
It can hold quite a bit of grain.
My workers will bring it over soon.

238
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,919
Alright! Thank you!

239
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:03,999
It's nothing.

240
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Come.

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Thank you!

242
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,759
Young Master,

243
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,120
King Ning's fire arrows never cease,

244
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,759
and we're down to our last gruel rations.

245
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
If this goes on...

246
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,223
Order the light cavalry,

247
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
ready their arms.

248
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,502
We regroup in 15 minutes.

249
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,600
You're going to the battlefield yourself?

250
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,079
You've been in Chang'an for years.

251
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,520
You've never led troops in battle.

252
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,862
I can't command an army like Yu Zheng can,

253
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,822
but I've trained in combat.

254
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
Every enemy slain is a life earned.

255
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,479
Two killed, a double victory.

256
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,562
Young Master...

257
00:16:58,574 --> 00:16:59,982
The night assault failed.

258
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,126
General Yu is fighting on the frontlines.

259
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,879
How could I stay here and
watch from the sidelines?

260
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,559
Understood.

261
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Report!

262
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,702
Suspicious vessel spotted
on the Fan River behind camp!

263
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Look!

264
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
We made it!

265
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,319
Mu Dan?

266
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,479
These provisions include rice, flour,

267
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,302
and pickles made by Hedong's people.

268
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,359
Enough to feed the
army for two to three days.

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,319
If more is needed, I'll find a way.

270
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Thank you.

271
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,222
Tell the soldiers the people
of Hedong stand with them.

272
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,623
Tell them not to lose heart.

273
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,583
We're waiting for their triumphant return.

274
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
What are those?

275
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,596
I appreciate your hard work.

276
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't mention it.

277
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Da Fu,

278
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,719
Mr. Yang's fishing boat has no cover.

279
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,877
If we hit rough waters,

280
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,823
the grain will get damp.

281
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:28,823
Go back to the shop and fetch
our stock of Juebei fireproof linen.

282
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,343
We'll use it to shield
the provisions from water.

283
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,502
If oil lamps tip during rough sailing,

284
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,502
it'll prevent the flames from catching.

285
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
- I'll go get it. - Go on.

286
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Da Fu!

287
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,062
Did I just say fireproof linen?

288
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,037
Yes, we have some.

289
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Why?

290
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,849
The night assault failed
because of fire attacks.

291
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:57,136
But if we make protective
gear out of fireproof material...

292
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,399
They can be protective gear!

293
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,920
- I'll go get them! - Go!

294
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,943
Our warehouses hold much
fireproof linen from Juebei trade.

295
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,996
Though, most of it was
sold to taverns and kitchens,

296
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,302
so the pieces are quite small.

297
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,495
So I mobilized Hedong's
people through the night,

298
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,262
stitching the fabric together.

299
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,824
We made wide battle cloaks,

300
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:22,520
and even crafted face guards
and chest covers for the warhorses,

301
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,542
specifically to counter fire attacks.

302
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,742
After measuring carefully,

303
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I expanded the patterns.

304
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,702
The soldiers can block
flames from the front

305
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,146
without it getting in the way of riding.

306
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,823
Mobilize all cavalrymen
without serious injuries.

307
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,616
Prepare for a second night assault.

308
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,142
Light the torches and
bring them near the horses.

309
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,526
Get them accustomed to the flames,

310
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,840
We can't have them
panicking at firewalls again.

311
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:55,999
Yes, sir!

312
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,295
King Ning's current position?

313
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,702
Scouts report he still convalesces in camp.

314
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Every moment counts.

315
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,272
We must reach the Central Army's rear

316
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,223
before dawn breaks.

317
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Yes, sir!

318
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,062
Report! An enemy squad has
been spotted ten li from camp.

319
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:14,716
They are closing in fast.

320
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,823
Fools who overestimate themselves.

321
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,502
Just as you predicted, My Lord,

322
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,502
Jiang Chang Yang hasn't given up.

323
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,903
That ignorant brat,

324
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:28,062
walking into his own death trap.

325
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:30,143
How are the preparations?

326
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Rest assured, My Lord.

327
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,103
I've had the trenches
refilled with fire oil.

328
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,542
They'll burn to ashes.

329
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,082
Be thorough this time.

330
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,416
Leave none alive.

331
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,742
Bring me Jiang Chang Yang's head,

332
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,240
or don't bother coming back.

333
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:48,598
Yes, My Lord!

334
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Fire!

335
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Fire again!

336
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,719
Send in the cavalry! Don't let them
get anywhere near His Lordship!

337
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,143
Recall all frontline troops immediately!

338
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,319
Yes, sir!

339
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,542
You're quick to adapt, I'll give you that.

340
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,542
Jiang Chang Yang,

341
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,262
so what if you took down my army banner?

342
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,200
The Hedong army

343
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,623
has barely 50,000 men.

344
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,716
You won't last long.

345
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,799
King Ning,

346
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,535
with your army banner fallen,

347
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,919
your lines of command are severed.

348
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,599
Why persist in this futile resistance?

349
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,800
The scattered troops guarding your rear

350
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,103
are falling apart.

351
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,502
Do you really think they can fight
their way through and get you out?

352
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,239
Alright!

353
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,663
We'll drag this out then!

354
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,262
I can wait until every last Hedong
soldier lies dead in the mud.

355
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
What should I fear?

356
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,143
I am His Majesty's elder brother.

357
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,262
You can't touch me.

358
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,502
And need I remind you...

359
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,742
You're the traitor here!

360
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,383
You may be His Majesty's brother,

361
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,623
but as for who the real traitor is,

362
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,502
that's not up to you to decide.

363
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,742
By His Majesty's decree,

364
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,621
all soldiers, hear this!

365
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,440
"King Ning, Li Xian stands accused
of slandering the Hedong Army,

366
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,716
executing loyal subjects,
and plotting rebellion.

367
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,062
His crimes are unpardonable.

368
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,336
Yu Zheng, Military Commissioner of Hedong,

369
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,160
is hereby commanded
to apprehend the traitor.

370
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,287
Any who resist on the battlefield
will be executed as accomplices!"

371
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,943
King Ning is the true traitor here.

372
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,916
The tide of this war has turned.

373
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:26,999
No...

374
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,782
It's over.

375
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,479
No...

376
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,183
Central Army, listen to me!

377
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,383
You were never the righteous
force quelling a rebellion.

378
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,542
His Majesty's decree has arrived.

379
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,502
If you continue resisting,

380
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:49,048
you will be branded as traitors yourselves,

381
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,253
guilty of crimes punishable by death!

382
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,719
- Let's go! - Come back!

383
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Don't listen to his lies!
Return to your posts!

384
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,719
King Ning!

385
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,343
You've always scorned merchants and women.

386
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,706
Yet guess who delivered
this imperial decree?

387
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,960
The Yu family are loyal to the throne.

388
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,519
They would never defect to King Ning.

389
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,716
A battle is inevitable.

390
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,919
I must give the Hedong
Army legitimate justification,

391
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:20,119
a way to prove on the battlefield
that Yu Zheng fights for the throne.

392
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,302
However, they must win this war.

393
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Only in victory

394
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,119
will this decree hold its weight.

395
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,663
If they lose,

396
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,440
it's nothing but a
worthless scrap of paper.

397
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,839
The camellias are blooming beautifully.

398
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,302
And the azaleas here are lovely too.

399
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,079
The wind picks up now.

400
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Don't catch a chill.

401
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,062
With the capital at peace,

402
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,262
you should return to Hexi soon.

403
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,302
Take care, Your Highness.

404
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,623
You think some alleged imperial
decree can shake my army's loyalty?

405
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,222
Who knows if it's even real!

406
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Soldiers,

407
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,742
the field commander need not
heed distant sovereigns' orders.

408
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,302
Out here, you obey me alone!

409
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,823
Jiang Chang Yang,

410
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,559
tell me,

411
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,103
with less than 50,000 men,

412
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,823
how do you think you'll win?

413
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,943
Even if you capture me now,

414
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,183
the Hexi and Jiannan armies
won't stand by and watch.

415
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,664
To prove they're no rebels,

416
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,222
they'll fight to the death to save me!

417
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,960
Remember this, brat,

418
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,262
the winning side writes the history,

419
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,520
the triumphant army defines justice!

420
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,239
They're here!

421
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,903
My reinforcements are
here! My men have come!

422
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,782
Didn't I tell you?

423
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,479
My Lord!

424
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,559
Li Xian!

425
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,039
It seems

426
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,630
justice stands with the Hedong army.

427
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
King Ning,

428
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,343
you've long sought my list of allies.

429
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,583
Well then, allow me to formally introduce

430
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,742
a very important ally of mine.

431
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,663
Xiao Wen Yan...

432
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,663
You traitor!

433
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,623
Soldiers! You are the fiercest
warriors of the Central Plains!

434
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,782
You should share in your
commander's fate, honor or disgrace!

435
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,716
Grab your weapons,

436
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,398
and fight your way back
to the capital with me!

437
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,623
When our cause triumphs,

438
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,062
you and your descendants

439
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,423
shall be honored for generations!

440
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
King Ning,

441
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,919
you've finally dropped the pretense.

442
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,229
Do you openly declare rebellion now?

443
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,262
What if I do?

444
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,462
Fight with me! Fight with me!

445
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
My Lord,

446
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,262
our troops are demoralized,

447
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,863
and we've lost our allies.

448
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,302
We can fight no longer.

449
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,143
I misjudged you completely.

450
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,943
You spineless coward!

451
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,383
Ungrateful wretch!

452
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,022
You've lost more than a leg,

453
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,462
you've even lost your spine, your fire!

454
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,343
I simply know how to follow the tide.

455
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,623
My loyalty was aligned with power.

456
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,903
Now my defection is too.

457
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,062
I've never changed my ways.

458
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,462
It's you, My Lord,

459
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,062
who are no longer the tide.

460
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,239
You...

461
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,462
I am Liu Chang, Vice Minister of War.

462
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,159
I surrender willingly and
submit myself for judgment.

463
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,676
I know I've committed grave sins,

464
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,863
punishable by execution.

465
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,982
But I've risked my life
to capture the traitor.

466
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:34,797
I possess irrefutable
proof of King Ning's crimes,

467
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,542
factionalism, murder of loyal officials.

468
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,143
I pledge to fully assist General
Yu Zheng's investigation,

469
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,943
to purge these corrupt officials

470
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,800
and restore His Majesty's authority!

471
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,423
Yu Zheng, Military Commissioner of Hedong,

472
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,534
for your merit in quelling the rebellion,

473
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:11,438
you are granted the title
of Commandery Prince.

474
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,376
You shall remain in the capital
to investigate this case thoroughly

475
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,240
and purge all remnants
of King Ning's faction.

476
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,583
I humbly accept the decree.

477
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,583
Thank you, Your Majesty.

478
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,383
Vice Minister of War Liu Chang.

479
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,376
Your guilty subject kneels before you.

480
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,960
As a conspirator's accomplice,
death would be your rightful due.

481
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,239
However,

482
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,720
you pledged guilty on the battlefield
and aided in capturing the traitor.

483
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,423
In light of your repentance and merit,

484
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,143
I will grant you clemency.

485
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,089
You shall be stripped
of office and property,

486
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,392
but spared execution.

487
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,183
Thank you, Your Majesty.

488
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Your Majesty.

489
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,022
I dare make one final plea.

490
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Speak.

491
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,782
I beg mercy for the County Princess.

492
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,903
Though she is King Ning's daughter,

493
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,982
she took no part in his treason.

494
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,702
The Li family's royal
bloodline is precious.

495
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:28,222
She is your kin, Your Majesty.

496
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,742
Please show mercy and spare her life.

497
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,319
My wife and I have neither power nor heirs,

498
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,262
we pose no threat to the court.

499
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,103
Please let this act of leniency

500
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,820
stand as proof of imperial
grace and benevolence.

501
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,039
Teacher...

502
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,583
General Yu...

503
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Zhangchou...

504
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,479
She Yan...

505
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,502
To all our fallen comrades...

506
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,039
Now,

507
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,823
the storm has passed.

508
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,583
A new chapter begins.

509
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
May you now

510
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,982
rest in peace.

511
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,022
I vow to protect

512
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:25,343
your closest companions with my life.

513
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,542
Let this promise ease your spirits.

514
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,120
May the heavens bless the Tang Empire

515
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,320
with lasting peace and prosperity.

516
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,823
So you've really decided to
abandon the identity of He Wei Fang?

517
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,516
What I've been through has been too bizarre

518
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,303
to explain to outsiders.

519
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,079
Besides,

520
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,743
since the corrupt official
Flower Bird Envoy is dead,

521
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,743
why can't I keep living as the
carefree flower shop owner?

522
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,160
I don't mind not being
Jiang Chang Yang anymore,

523
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,102
though I'll miss my estate.

524
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Me too.

525
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,423
I put so much effort into
tending that soil for my flowers.

526
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,303
How about we sneak back in

527
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,823
and steal the flowerbeds?

528
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,703
I've lost my home,

529
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,528
and you're hung up on dirt?

530
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,039
A corrupt official should
always expect to end up like this.

531
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:48,136
But Fang Garden has space to spare.

532
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,336
Plenty of empty rooms available.

533
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,742
Pick whichever one you like.

534
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,200
I have no objections to a live-in husband.

535
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,102
Though you've been away from Chang'an,

536
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,599
your capable staff managed

537
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,503
to reclaim Fang Garden in just over a year.

538
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:04,277
With business this prosperous,

539
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,280
you'll have no shortage of visitors.

540
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,783
I should teach you my
tricks for vanishing acts.

541
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,502
So you won't have to flee in panic
when bumping into old acquaintances.

542
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,464
You can keep those
shady little tricks to yourself.

543
00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:18,472
My silver tongue will
get me out of anything.

544
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,199
What if someone shuts
that clever mouth of yours?

545
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,183
What do you think?

546
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,943
Are you taking advantage
of me in broad daylight?

547
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,456
Mercy, my dear!

548
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
All this time away from Chang'an,

549
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,679
I've craved nothing but
the palace's mulberry wine.

550
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Exquisite.

551
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,880
You're fortunate that Li Xian
coveted the list of our allies.

552
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,743
Had he truly wanted you dead...

553
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,039
No brink of death,

554
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,543
no glorious rebirth!

555
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,200
Frankly, I should thank
him for his precise stab,

556
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:23,062
leaving me severely
injured without killing me.

557
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,783
You've stared death in the face,

558
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,400
and still you joke like you
have no fear in the world.

559
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,240
For my country I'd sacrifice myself,

560
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,703
meeting death as a homecoming.

561
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,841
Teacher's teachings stay with me.

562
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,542
Even if I had died that day for the cause,

563
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,263
I would've had no regrets.

564
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,039
So Your Majesty, don't blame yourself.

565
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,679
Sui Zhi,

566
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,199
as you know,

567
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,880
I've never seen you as just a subject.

568
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,823
You are my brother.

569
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,743
So had you died for any cause,

570
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,039
I would have...

571
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,142
You really think I don't
know what you're up to?

572
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,343
You're trying to get me drunk
so I'll grant your requests.

573
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,343
The throne is secured,

574
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
the nation is at peace.

575
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,959
Our fallen comrades and the people
of Mengzhou can finally rest in peace.

576
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Now it's your turn

577
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,943
to shape this golden age.

578
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,396
All my youthful dreams are fulfilled.

579
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:52,539
One shouldn't be

580
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,903
too greedy in life.

581
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,520
You are a righteous and loyal man.

582
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,919
Why won't you restore your
name and clear your reputation?

583
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,239
Mu Dan and I... Our
identities are too complicated.

584
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,800
If we suddenly come back
from the dead with fanfare,

585
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,668
it will raise many questions
that can't be easily explained.

586
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Besides,

587
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,582
I've never cared for ranks or titles,

588
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,823
or historical glory.

589
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,233
You might not care for
status or family honor,

590
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,559
but what about Mu Dan?

591
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,343
She feels the same.

592
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,119
This empire is vast,

593
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,542
local officials often escape scrutiny.

594
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,216
Following Mu Dan in her merchant ventures,

595
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,960
I'll serve as your eyes and ears from afar.

596
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,502
Wherever we go,

597
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,020
no corrupt official or
bandit chief will thrive.

598
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,343
You just want to travel
the world with Mu Dan,

599
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,982
leaving me behind

600
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,662
all alone,

601
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,502
in this cold and empty palace.

602
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,223
I dare you to repeat that
in front of Consort Shu.

603
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,679
San Lang.

604
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Sui Zhi.

605
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,360
(Fang Garden)

606
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,280
Madam Xiao Hua, your
shop is reopening soon.

607
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,582
Why are you looking concerned now?

608
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,062
I haven't figured out

609
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,982
how to tell everyone we're leaving.

610
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,816
If you don't want to deal
with tears and farewells,

611
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,102
we could slip away quietly.

612
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,601
We'll take your
flower boat and...

613
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:09,502
Absolutely not.

614
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,823
After everything we've
been through, leaving like that

615
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,903
will break their hearts.

616
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,936
How are the preparations coming along?

617
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,680
Don't worry, Miss Yun is taking care of it.

618
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,080
It should be ready in a few days.

619
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:37,199
Leader Lv, come.

620
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,479
Leader Lv.

621
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:45,967
Come here.

622
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,600
About the plan we discussed
last time, it still needs work.

623
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,400
What do you think they are talking about?
