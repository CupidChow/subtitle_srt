1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,000
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,920
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,447
How much of the people's blood and sweat have you stolen?

4
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:46,880
- Beat him up! - Beat him up!

5
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:49,800
Darn you, corrupt official!

6
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,320
- Beat him up! - Beat up that corrupt official!

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,595
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:55,240
I didn't want you to see me like this.

9
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,800
Jiang Chang Yang, listen to me,

10
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:58,998
from the moment we signed that first contract,

11
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,120
I've been in this with you, all the way.

12
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,958
No matter what happens, we're facing it together.

13
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,320
That's him!

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,646
He's the corrupt official!

15
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,840
- Darned corrupt official! - Beat him to death!

16
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:11,575
He deserved it! The heavens have finally delivered justice!

17
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,640
- Go away! - Get away from him!

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,320
Scram!

19
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,600
Don't touch her!

20
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:19,040
We mustn't let him off!

21
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,282
Zhangchou Feng, I was His Majesty's study companion since young.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,720
I spent time with him every day.

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
You're just a lowly official. How dare you touch me?

24
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,382
You've committed too many sins. Even His Majesty couldn't tolerate it.

25
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,380
His Majesty's decree has already arrived.

26
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,604
You better confess to your sins and receive the decree.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,943
I shall welcome His Majesty's decree.

28
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,922
The minister of Court of Imperial Entertainments

29
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,535
cum Flower Bird Envoy, Jiang Chang Yang,

30
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,336
He formed factions, neglected his duties, occupied office without merit,

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,480
and embezzled public funds with evidence to prove it.

32
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,110
On account of his years of servitude,

33
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,326
I cannot bear to punish him too harshly.

34
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,235
He shall be stripped of his position from tomorrow onward.

35
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,701
Jiang Chang Yang's illicit gains and illegal businesses

36
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,563
are hereby confiscated in full

37
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,302
and turned over to the national treasury.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,205
Uncuff him.

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,223
Jiang Chang Yang, receive the decree.

40
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,862
I'm innocent!

41
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:28,300
All this money and silk, plus the rare and exotic treasures in your estate

42
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,295
amount to well over 500,000 strings of coins.

43
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,862
How dare you say that you're innocent?

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,902
Half of them came from my profits.

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,896
Half of them were the bribes I received from all kinds of officials.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,656
I can confess to my crime of accepting bribes.

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,015
But embezzling the taxes collected by the Ministry of Revenue

48
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,279
is something I cannot admit to!

49
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,191
By the way,

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,830
I've recorded all the bribes I'd received from the officials.

51
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,896
Vice Minister Zhangchou,

52
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,223
please hand this to His Majesty and prove my innocence.

53
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,742
Do not let off any of the corrupt officials!

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,040
Do not let off any of the corrupt officials!

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,239
Do not let off any of the corrupt officials!

56
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,639
Do not let off any of the corrupt officials!

57
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,983
Do not let off any of the corrupt officials!

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,302
Stop the commotion!

59
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,302
Scum, you're something else.

60
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,142
How dare you try to frame others when you're in hot water yourself?

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,976
You'll know whether I'm framing them or not when you investigate the case!

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,175
Hand it to His Majesty and punish all forms of corruption!

63
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,199
Hand it to His Majesty and punish all forms of corruption!

64
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,543
Commoners!

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,903
Commoners, say no more.

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,262
His Majesty shall judge this case fairly.

67
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,774
Let's go!

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,680
Make sure this corrupt official is punished!

69
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,801
Let's go.

70
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,141
I earned them all these years through my own effort!

71
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:48,285
Jiang Chang Yang.

72
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,177
Jiang Chang Yang!

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,666
Beat him up!

74
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,564
Stop it!

75
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,600
- Stop it! - Wait!

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,817
Stop this immediately!

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
Wait! Don't hurt the kind lady!

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,543
Wait!

79
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,127
Madam He, you're kind.

80
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,343
Why must you side with corrupt officials like him?

81
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,961
She's his concubine. They're on the same side!

82
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,615
I'm sure she's a bad guy too. Beat them up!

83
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,479
You mustn't say that. Madam He's Wuyong Clinic

84
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,600
was the one who treated my father's condition.

85
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,896
Madam He, you should hurry and leave Jiang Chang Yang.

86
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,319
If not, he'll implicate you.

87
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,479
That's right!

88
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:23,386
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,561
No matter what outsiders say about you,

90
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,159
to me,

91
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,211
we make the perfect pair, Jiang Sui Zhi.

92
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,476
Come.

93
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,649
Let's go home.

94
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:38,525
Beat him up!

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
You'll receive your just desserts!

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,126
(King Ning's Residence)

97
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,182
Those who bribed him all came from noble families.

98
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,494
Every move he makes affects the entire situation.

99
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,637
Better to be cautious with gentlemen than to fall short with petty men.

100
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,826
I'm sure you understand that.

101
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,611
Jiang Chang Yang is a prideful person.

102
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:14,583
I told you to cut off his escape route, not to trample on his dignity.

103
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,721
Now, the dog has bitten back. His Lordship's men were implicated as well.

104
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,617
I never expected Jiang Chang Yang to be this shameless.

105
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,279
He made things difficult for other people after losing his position.

106
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,663
He even resorted to offending noble clans and His Lordship.

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,862
However, the entire city has heard about this case.

108
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,742
If we deal with them together, we'll receive the people's praise.

109
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,103
I think it's beneficial to His Lordship's reputation as well.

110
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,483
Zhangchou, I suppose you made a name for yourself too.

111
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,271
You've suppressed Lu Chu's arrogance.

112
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,359
His Majesty has promoted you to the ranks of Minister of Revenue.

113
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,223
The imperial court can't do anything about it.

114
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,712
The Minister of Revenue is in His Lordship's grasp all along.

115
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:06,206
As for the vacancies,

116
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:10,143
we can slot in loyal aides gradually.

117
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,278
Zheng Shou De is useless.

118
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,534
It depends on your abilities

119
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,522
whether or not you can stabilize your position.

120
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,062
My Lord, thank you for the recommendation.

121
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,005
Although the contract has been terminated,

122
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm afraid our ties will still affect your business.

123
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,537
Why don't we...

124
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,461
If I leave you right now,

125
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,874
I'll truly become a petty flatterer in other people's eyes.

126
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,609
Bear with it.

127
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,213
Too many people depend on you to make a living now.

128
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,824
You should focus on the bigger picture.

129
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,656
You want to know the bigger picture?

130
00:07:57,817 --> 00:08:00,783
Only less noble people are buying our flowers now.

131
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,617
But my business is still booming.

132
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,719
Blooming Abode and Qingshu Pavilion

133
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,780
sell mostly cheap and affordable things to the common people.

134
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,146
As for Wuyong Clinic, we depend on female physicians and cheap medicine.

135
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,477
Both sides won't be implicated by your scandal.

136
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:21,669
I'm glad to hear that.

137
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:23,695
How are you glad?

138
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,030
Good officials leave behind monuments and biographies

139
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:29,895
even after their passing.

140
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:31,862
But you?

141
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:35,048
It's fine that no one knows about the good deeds you've done.

142
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,312
But the people were trying to beat you to death as well.

143
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,940
As for the deeds I've done,

144
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,265
San Lang, my mentor, and you know all about them.

145
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,155
That's more than enough.

146
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,081
You always hide half of the truth from me.

147
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,663
I dare not say that I know all about them.

148
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,628
Sometimes, I'm afraid they might be worried.

149
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,154
I hid it from them too. It's not just you.

150
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:01,800
How could I be the same as them?

151
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:04,033
You should stop hiding things from me in the future.

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,167
Zhangchou Feng is one of my men.

153
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,662
Since you can't dispel King Ning's doubts,

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,063
you forsook your position and helped Zhangchou Feng to replace you.

155
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,414
It's not just for his sake.

156
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,495
Among the Six Ministries, Two Capitals, and Thirteen Circuits,

157
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,096
over 30 corrupt official will be implicated due to what I've done.

158
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,343
They'll be investigated and sent to prison soon.

159
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,839
Among them was the vacant post of the prefect who exploited Sheng County.

160
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,223
Clean and just officials will replace them gradually.

161
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,350
I know the state is important.

162
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:07,894
But your safety is important too.

163
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,766
Have you ever considered the fact that King Ning might take your life?

164
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:13,104
What if he uses the people's rage against you

165
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:14,608
and force His Majesty to execute you?

166
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,902
What will you do, by then?

167
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,254
King Ning won't do that.

168
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,845
If he punishes me severely, his men will suffer too.

169
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,271
Moreover, I was of great help to him before this.

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,590
He couldn't verify his suspicion of me either.

171
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,536
He's doing this

172
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,123
to test and intimidate me.

173
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,672
Now, you've lost all of your wealth.

174
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,519
It'll be inconvenient for you to serve San Lang in this state.

175
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,636
You should notify me in advance if you have any operations.

176
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,832
I have a trading caravan. It'll be easier to enter and exit Chang'an...

177
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,576
You've already served your state well by establishing Wuyong Clinic.

178
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,633
As for political affairs,

179
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:57,183
it's better for you to stay away from them.

180
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,889
Jiang Chang Yang.

181
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,981
Must you treat me like a stranger?

182
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,335
It's the second watch of the night!

183
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,133
If Lian Zhou did use the flower extract, it should've worked two hours ago.

184
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,749
Why isn't she here yet?

185
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,144
Don't be impatient. Let's wait a little longer.

186
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,703
It's the second watch of the night!

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,925
Here she is.

188
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,421
Let's go.

189
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,273
What's going on?

190
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,083
Initially, Madam was packing her belongings.

191
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,662
She told me happily that she could leave the Pei Residence after tonight.

192
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,022
But she was dragged away by Pei Zhong

193
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,823
before she could use the flower extract.

194
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,759
King Ning gifted Lian Zhou to Pei Zhong.

195
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,439
How could Pei Zhong treat her like this now that she's dead?

196
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,022
Madam begged for her life when she was beaten up.

197
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,587
But too many women had died in the residence.

198
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:52,037
All of them were treated as such.

199
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,640
Their bodies were wrapped with a straw mat and tossed to the mass grave.

200
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,095
No one cared about them.

201
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,251
Why?

202
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,759
Why am I always one step too late?

203
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:14,749
Why?

204
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,662
Why do I always fail to save them?

205
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,183
It is bitter enough to be born a woman.

206
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,734
Lowly and plain.

207
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,567
I can't even bring myself to speak of it again.

208
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,964
In this state, Lian Zhou looks better

209
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:25,415
than the first time we met her.

210
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,718
Madam,

211
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:32,816
you're finally relieved from your suffering.

212
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,136
You can finally be reunited with your mother.

213
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,780
(Grave of Lian Zhou)

214
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,321
(Lian Zhou.)

215
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,220
(May you be sheltered and guarded in your next life, )

216
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,742
(where you can lead a carefree life.)

217
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,587
(Wuyong Clinic)

218
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,703
Take care, mister.

219
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,502
You should've laid low in the residence.

220
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,119
What are you doing here instead?

221
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:39,672
Liu Lang said you were in a bad mood.

222
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,501
I saw that the business of Wuyong Clinic was busy as usual.

223
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,125
Did something happen to the other shops?

224
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,550
Lian Zhou died.

225
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,563
She was sent to the Pei Residence.

226
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,674
I'm not surprised.

227
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,719
A few days ago, we promised that she could lead

228
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,396
a carefree life after she had escaped from the Pei Residence.

229
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,375
No matter if it's Sheng Yi,

230
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:13,702
the mute girl,

231
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:15,926
or Lian Zhou,

232
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,759
I couldn't save any of them.

233
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,679
Do you think you didn't save any people with Wuyong Clinic?

234
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,903
You're not a deity.

235
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,800
Why must you be this harsh on yourself?

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,115
Indeed.

237
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:51,087
The world is unpredictable.

238
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:52,900
Life is fragile.

239
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,191
Therefore,

240
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,223
we must cherish the people in front of us.

241
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:03,698
Don't you agree?

242
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,128
Brother-in-law was stripped of his position.

243
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:37,600
Mu Dan, you took great care of him.

244
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,170
Did he cherish you even more when you two were alone?

245
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,740
Liu Lang, you're hiding something from me.

246
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,010
No, I'm not hiding anything.

247
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,759
Before this, you tried to persuade me to move out of the Jiang Residence.

248
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,046
Now, not only do you call Jiang Chang Yang Brother-in-law,

249
00:17:59,384 --> 00:18:00,744
but you also told him to visit me.

250
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,647
Be honest with me. Did you guys do something behind my back?

251
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,651
Mu Dan, do you still remember the white jade hairpin?

252
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,724
Liu Lang, you shouldn't have done so.

253
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,446
Besides Sheng Yi and Mother,

254
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,399
you're the only person who treats me sincerely.

255
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,742
I didn't want you to be heartbroken because of Jiang Chang Yang.

256
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,232
I didn't want you to abandon me one day.

257
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,491
Since I said that I would look after you on Sheng Yi's behalf,

258
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,378
that means I would be your elder sister forever.

259
00:18:47,664 --> 00:18:49,045
Why would I abandon you?

260
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,062
And now, it's because I'm your sister

261
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,983
that I have the responsibility to teach you to mend your ways.

262
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,143
Liu Lang, we need to be sincere when we mingle with people.

263
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,320
If you use underhanded means to acquire items and relationships,

264
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,966
they'll vanish one day.

265
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:07,893
Do you understand?

266
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,634
I understand now.

267
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,158
Since there was fear in your heart,

268
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,246
why did you tell Jiang Chang Yang about the truth, then?

269
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,786
Back then, you were abducted.

270
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,960
He took me with him as we rushed to your rescue.

271
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,523
He didn't make a sound even though he was bleeding non-stop.

272
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,703
After that, he even told me to clean the blood on the harness

273
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,851
so that you wouldn't feel guilty about it.

274
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,582
From then, I knew that he truly cared about you.

275
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,223
Thus, I told him the truth so that he could face you honestly.

276
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,553
Who knew that he would be a scaredy cat?

277
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,246
I was getting so impatient.

278
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,819
Liu Lang, you have a kind and pure nature. You never forget one's kindness.

279
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,622
Now, you know the error of your ways.

280
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,359
This time, I'll let it pass.

281
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,302
But you better not repeat your mistake in the future.

282
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,983
And, in the future, if you find out

283
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,191
that Jiang Chang Yang is risking his life for my sake,

284
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,895
do not hide the truth on his behalf again.

285
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:19,907
Yes, Mu Dan.

286
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,227
Chang Yang also consoled me and told me that you wouldn't abandon me.

287
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,799
He understood you more than anyone else.

288
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Mu Dan, now that you've known about what happened,

289
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:31,287
please do not be upset again.

290
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,463
Chang Yang truly cherishes you a lot.

291
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,934
Got it. Finish your tea.

292
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,830
(Jiang Residence)

293
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:47,889
What did you say?

294
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,480
I said, I want to learn some martial arts.

295
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,449
Since you have nothing to do, why don't you teach me?

296
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,192
You have no foundation in martial arts. You cannot pick it up.

297
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,256
There are no disciples too stupid to learn, only mentors too lazy to teach.

298
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,861
Take this!

299
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,400
This is all you got? What makes you think you can pick it up?

300
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:09,353
Who said I couldn't pick it up?

301
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,315
Didn’t you say I had strong hands when you taught me

302
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,789
how to use a slingshot?

303
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,423
Besides, I'm not a noble lady trapped within the courtyard walls.

304
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
I used to toss stone locks all the time, you know?

305
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,800
Da Fu studied martial arts. Why can't I do the same?

306
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,663
Da Fu studied it since young.

307
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,479
It's not too late for me to learn it now.

308
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,025
Judging from the path I'm taking now,

309
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,983
I can protect myself during crucial moments if I learn martial arts.

310
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,457
Fine.

311
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,663
But let me give you a reminder.

312
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,240
It'll take at least 3 to 5 years for you to achieve some results.

313
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,200
And, you have to endure hardships as well.

314
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:45,200
Don't worry. Do you know who I am?

315
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,903
I'm He Wei Fang, you know?

316
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,359
I'm not afraid of any hardships.

317
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,664
Punch forward.

318
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,102
Defend with your right arm.

319
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,159
Attack the abdomen with your left.

320
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,102
This won't do. Your lower body isn't stable enough.

321
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,423
Why don't we try something easier?

322
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:08,271
Who said my lower body wasn't stable enough?

323
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,070
We've been training for some time.

324
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,423
Let's have some tea.

325
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,231
By the way,

326
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,294
do you still have the hairpin

327
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,681
that Liu Lang had broken?

328
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,703
You see, I'm very stingy.

329
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
Why don't you return the hairpin to me?

330
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,030
I'll hire someone to mend it with gold.

331
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,761
It won't be a waste no matter if I use it as an accessory

332
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,556
or sell it to a pawn shop.

333
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,800
It's inauspicious to keep a broken hairpin. I've already disposed of it.

334
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,055
Since it was a thank-you gift for the rescue at Fang Garden,

335
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,213
I appreciate your intention.

336
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,807
You shouldn't spend any money on me anymore.

337
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,035
You had disposed of it?

338
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,742
It's a chilly cold snap this evening.

339
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,936
Why are you messing with the floor heating?

340
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:59,062
Come in.

341
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,520
Jiang Chang Yang.

342
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,360
The floor heating of my room has broken down. It's so cold.

343
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,360
I need to borrow your room for the night.

344
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:30,495
I'm sure this'll warm you up.

345
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,232
Rest early. I'll sleep in the side chamber.

346
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,653
Wait a minute.

347
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,983
Everyone in the residence knows that I'm in your room now.

348
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,255
If you leave me alone, they'll surely start to suspect us.

349
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:46,431
They'll suspect us for falling out with each other.

350
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,480
What's wrong? Are you shy?

351
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,863
The Flower Bird Envoy was known as a womanizer.

352
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,670
You've staged so many acts before.

353
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:01,496
What's wrong with staging one more?

354
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,903
Naturally, I'm not shy.

355
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:06,670
You may sleep first.

356
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:08,752
I'll read before sleeping.

357
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,623
Did Xue Xi write to you?

358
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,726
I wonder how she's doing right now.

359
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,133
Sometimes, no news is actually good news.

360
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:35,186
She gave me a secret gift before she left.

361
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:39,047
Do you know what is it?

362
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,476
It's a secret between women.

363
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,449
I don't want to get myself involved.

364
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:48,711
Are you sure you don't want to get involved?

365
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:50,624
Or are you too timid to get involved?

366
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,513
You managed your shop and learned martial arts this morning.

367
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:55,743
Aren't you tired?

368
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:57,672
You should hurry and rest.

369
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,826
Your room is so bright. How can I sleep?

370
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,191
You can sleep now, right?

371
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:30,907
I'll continue reading, then.

372
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,719
Wait.

373
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:36,062
You're reading in a dark room. You might spoil your eyes.

374
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:38,359
Enough already. Let's sleep together.

375
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,376
It's not like I'll take advantage of you.

376
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,527
What are you afraid of?

377
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,502
What are you staring at?

378
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,463
There's nothing on the ceiling.

379
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,822
Jiang Chang Yang, if you can't sleep,

380
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:16,629
why don't we have a chat, just like the time when we were in the palace?

381
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:20,421
It's tiring to chat.

382
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:23,551
I need to see San Lang in the palace tomorrow.

383
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:26,528
Why don't we admire the moon?

384
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,093
Stop troubling yourself.

385
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,667
If you open the window, the heat will disperse.

386
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,790
I thought Xiao Chun had helped you regulate your health.

387
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,519
But you're still afraid of the cold.

388
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,371
You should take more spring baths in the future.

389
00:27:46,856 --> 00:27:48,091
Jiang Chang Yang.

390
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:53,724
Those river lanterns that weren't lit,

391
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,072
if only I could see them myself.

392
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,769
I'm sure they're more beautiful than a full moon on the 15th day.

393
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,536
Enough already. Time to sleep.

394
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,383
How dare you still come to see me?

395
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,342
You've truly disappointed me.

396
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,775
Your Majesty, you can beat me to death

397
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:00,200
as long as you're appeased by the end of the day.

398
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,000
You're doing this all because I tolerated your willful demeanor!

399
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,544
Although I'm no longer the Flower Bird Envoy,

400
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,721
you're still on my mind constantly, Your Majesty.

401
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,817
With labor and rest in balance, your health will flourish.

402
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:13,384
Only then will the kingdom stand firm.

403
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,959
Your Majesty, I've gotten you ten fighting chickens with special feathers.

404
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,640
Your Majesty, are you willing to check them out?

405
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,016
It's rare that you still have my interest at heart.

406
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:40,079
Go and get us some fresh tea.

407
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,675
Yes, Your Majesty.

408
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,594
San Lang.

409
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:01,280
Lu Chu is dead.

410
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:10,062
Vice Minister Chu chose to be the whistleblower.

411
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:12,952
He was ready for death since then.

412
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:19,341
Look after his family on my behalf.

413
00:30:22,136 --> 00:30:23,456
Last night, King Ning had already

414
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:26,871
drowned them in the Wei River.

415
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:30,399
What?

416
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,060
King Ning wanted to intimidate me with their deaths.

417
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,087
I should've sent his family to Chang'an before it happened.

418
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,440
But back then, I was afraid that it might alert him to our presence.

419
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,342
I never expected King Ning to be this ruthless.

420
00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,367
Sui Zhi,

421
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:54,177
I no longer want to wait any longer.

422
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:57,768
Our men have been steadily taking up posts across the ministries.

423
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,423
If the examination reforms go through,

424
00:31:00,664 --> 00:31:02,904
we can expect a surge in morale after the spring trials.

425
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:04,744
That is the perfect time to act.

426
00:31:06,088 --> 00:31:07,351
Are we being too hasty here?

427
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,092
Our men only took up posts not long ago.

428
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:12,233
Their foundation isn't stable enough.

429
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:15,158
We mustn't miss out on this opportunity.

430
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,711
If we keep waiting, King Ning will install his own men again.

431
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,361
So long as Hedong is ours and Yu Chang's forces are in place,

432
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:23,989
we have nothing to fear.

433
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:27,568
The late emperor's death anniversary is nearing.

434
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,832
General Yu was closely acquainted with the late emperor.

435
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:33,090
Now that the border areas are at peace, it's reasonable for him

436
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:36,062
to bring his army back, pay respect to the late emperor,

437
00:31:36,384 --> 00:31:37,655
and bring back news of peace.

438
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,632
Relay the message to Hedong.

439
00:31:41,584 --> 00:31:42,628
Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,739
Are you worried about Mu Dan's safety?

441
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,076
I will send her away before the operation.

442
00:32:00,015 --> 00:32:01,171
I'll ensure her safety.

443
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,599
You've known him for a long time.

444
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,693
I'm sure you know about his past well.

445
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,347
Why does he always keep people at arm's length

446
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:11,319
and face everything by himself?

447
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:16,419
Has Sui Zhi ever mentioned Princess Shou Chang to you?

448
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:22,673
When Sui Zhi entered the palace at a young age,

449
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:25,174
Princess Shou Chang treated him kindly.

450
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,407
After Sui Zhi lost his mother,

451
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,174
he became more defiant.

452
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,995
Princess Shou Chang would defend him whenever he got into a fight.

453
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:39,500
To Sui Zhi, Princess Shou Chang was his elder sister.

454
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,065
She was his closest kin.

455
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,355
Could it be that Sui Zhi was related to her death?

456
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:49,734
He wasn't the culprit,

457
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:53,334
yet he still felt guilty about her death and couldn't let it go.

458
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:57,256
Back then, a natural disaster befell Mengzhou.

459
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:59,246
He was worried about his hometown.

460
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,262
He suggested San Lang, who was the crown prince, and Princess Shou Chang

461
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:05,331
to visit his hometown in secret.

462
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,078
King Ning was the one responsible for providing disaster relief.

463
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,873
When King Ning reported back to the imperial court,

464
00:33:17,408 --> 00:33:19,168
he said all the disaster victims were saved.

465
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:23,703
But when they arrived at Mengzhou, they thought it was hell on Earth.

466
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,943
His Majesty was enraged. He wanted to punish the local officials.

467
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:32,079
Sui Zhi was worried that the local authorities might hide the evidence

468
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:34,326
upon detecting their identities.

469
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,735
He suggested gathering evidence in secret

470
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,616
and hand them to the Court of Judicial Review.

471
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,720
He wanted to take the corrupt officials by surprise.

472
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,443
But they had no idea that their identities were exposed from the start.

473
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:48,820
King Ning sent his men to set fire to the place

474
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,341
under the guise of disaster victims.

475
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,782
Sui Zhi did everything he could to rescue San Lang.

476
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,383
He couldn't rescue Princess Shou Chang.

477
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:02,540
He stood there as he watched the fire engulf Princess Shou Chang.

478
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,969
Execute them!

479
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,022
What rendered Sui Zhi helpless

480
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,455
was that King Ning pushed the blame for the princess's death

481
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:13,280
on several innocent disaster victims.

482
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,713
He said they tried to steal the disaster provision

483
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:18,624
and set fire to create chaos, implicating the princess in the process.

484
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,908
Sui Zhi blamed himself

485
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:24,303
for the death of the princess and the disaster victims.

486
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,703
He hated corrupt officials to the core

487
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,102
after witnessing the situation in his hometown.

488
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,919
So, it was from that moment onward

489
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,739
he decided to become the notorious Flower Bird Envoy.

490
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,447
It's no wonder

491
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:49,004
he feared fire.

492
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,018
Sui Zhi said that he owed his life to the imperial family.

493
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:55,847
He said that he didn't deserve to have any personal motives.

494
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,253
But I can tell that he cherishes you.

495
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,062
That's precisely why he's afraid.

496
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,321
He's afraid that you might end up like Princess Shou Chang.

497
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:09,736
You might be implicated for no reason.

498
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,903
But I'm not afraid.

499
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,048
He has punished himself for many years.

500
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:18,337
It was more than enough.

501
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:22,455
Now that I'm around, I won't let him suffer again.

502
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:08,760
Come to my courtyard. Let's have a drink and admire the moon.

503
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:11,063
By the way,

504
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,264
I have something to tell you as well.

505
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,505
The moon gate in your courtyard isn't well positioned.

506
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:23,793
We have to take a detour just to get there.

507
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:26,083
You should renovate it when you're free.

508
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:30,102
It's been a long day for me. I don't think I'll join you.

509
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,689
Farewell.

510
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,783
From now on, there'll be no obstacles between us.

511
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:53,478
Jiang Chang Yang,

512
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,243
there's no place for you to escape

513
00:36:58,352 --> 00:36:59,487
from my feelings.

514
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,999
You once said

515
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,825
that when I was in danger,

516
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:29,688
you would come to my rescue when you see this signal.

517
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:34,712
But did you know that I didn't fancy you

518
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:36,565
just because you could protect me?

519
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,256
It's because you're the thick-skinned Jiang Chang Yang.

520
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,279
You hold justice in your heart,

521
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,582
yet you cover it up with a flamboyant attitude.

522
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,863
Every part of you has become my favorite part.

523
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:56,305
Consort Shu has already told me about your backstory

524
00:37:57,663 --> 00:37:59,180
and what was bothering you all along.

525
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:04,651
In this situation,

526
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,074
you'll be in grave danger just by staying beside me.

527
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:10,844
I know.

528
00:38:11,816 --> 00:38:14,136
The great ambition you chase is a path lined with dangers.

529
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,489
That's why you don't dare to get close to me.

530
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,656
But I'm not afraid.

531
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:25,383
No matter if the step I'm taking will bring me fortune or danger,

532
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,944
let me be the one to walk toward you now.

533
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,720
Even if you might die because of me?

534
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,870
From now on, we're one.

535
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,339
Let's be true husband and wife.

536
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,510
Let's be a real family.

537
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,508
Let us create a prosperous era together.

538
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:03,102
When I was young,

539
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:08,321
I was conceited. I thought I could protect many people.

540
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:15,231
In the end, I could only stand idly by as they suffered terrible deaths.

541
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:22,087
I don't have confidence in my plans.

542
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,827
It's my debt. I can repay it with my life.

543
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,502
But I shouldn't drag you into this.

544
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,918
Why can't desire and righteousness coexist?

545
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,913
Jiang Chang Yang.

546
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,209
Why don't you dare to give it a try?

547
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,388
The world is vast.

548
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,626
You don't need to lose your life in Chang'an because of me.

549
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,331
Just forget about me.

550
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:16,953
You should make sure Wuyong Clinic thrives across the state.

551
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:22,222
That's the life He Wei Fang should pursue.

552
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:28,384
Jiang Chang Yang, listen up!

553
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,429
I will never give up!

554
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,434
I'm not afraid of death!

555
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,807
But I am!

556
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,273
I don't want you to die.
