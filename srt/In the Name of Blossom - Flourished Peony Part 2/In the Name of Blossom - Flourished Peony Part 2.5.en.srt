00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:42,120
[Episode 5]

2
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,959
But you are here.
How can I possibly stay out of it?

3
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,599
I cannot intervene with the nobility,

4
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,809
but I can handle things outside the palace.

5
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:52,359
I can help you find the peddler.

6
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,120
The opponent has surely
fully prepared to frame me.

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,959
How could they let you find a flaw?
I have my own way to resolve it.

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,159
Before I leave, stay well in the Jiang Mansion
and do not show yourself.

9
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,480
Be wary of Liu Chang and the County Princess.

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,719
It's Prince Ning and his men again.

11
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,519
Don't worry. I will take good care of myself.

12
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,360
But Prince Ning has been on good terms with you.
Is it because of me this time?

13
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,728
This time, it's aimed at me.
It has nothing to do with you.

14
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:31,120
Don't worry, these traps won't nail me down.

15
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,976
They just want to trap me here,
probably to test something.

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,719
Just leave the flowers here.
Stop moving them around.

17
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,519
They look quite nice.

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,919
I have nothing to hide.
Let Liu Chang do whatever he wants.

19
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,200
I am happy to relax here for two days.

20
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,640
You really don't need to worry about me.

21
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:28,479
I saw him at a banquet at Jiang's residence.
Where is he taking the Financial Clerk?

22
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,680
They are heading west.

23
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,520
Oh no, it's Wanguan Hall. They are going
to check Jiang Chang Yang's private accounts.

24
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
Go and inform Yun Niang.
I'll go and stall Liu Chang.

25
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,279
- Okay.
- Go quickly.

26
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,120
Ma'am, are you okay?

27
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
Ma'am, I'll take you to the clinic.

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Make way, make way.

29
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,639
Quickly, make way.

30
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,840
Make way, make way.

31
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
He Wei Fang?

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Lord.

33
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,759
Are you hurt?

34
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,399
I, I just accidentally fell
and twisted my ankle. I can't walk.

35
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,840
Could Mr. Liu take me back to Qingshuzhai?

36
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,439
Sure.

37
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
This is not the road to Qingshuzhai.

38
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,520
Proud as you are, you've learned
to bow your head to me for Jiang Chang Yang.

39
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,280
Since you already knew,
why did you still let me get in the carriage?

40
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,744
It's rare for you to come to me.

41
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:01,400
No matter the reason, I am willing
to spend more time with you at this moment.

42
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,079
Then can you tell me where you're taking me now?

43
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,639
The wind and rain are getting stronger.
I'm just taking you home.

44
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,960
I've also sent someone to pick up Zhu Fu
to keep you company.

45
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Listen up. No one is allowed in or out.

46
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,960
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:57,224
[Wanguan Hall]

48
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
How is it?

49
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,280
Take a look.

50
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,279
How about we agree on a secret code?

51
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,120
If you encounter another incident
or discover any unusual moves by Prince Ning,

52
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,279
and you can't find me at the moment,
you can leave a message with the code,

53
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,199
and my people will see it.

54
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,759
You're best at sneaky matters.
I'll follow your lead.

55
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,839
The different pictures on this palace lantern
can represent different enterprises of ours.

56
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,199
If any place is in danger,

57
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,879
just hang it with the matching picture
facing the Jiang Mansion.

58
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,280
The person who conveys messages
in the residence will take care of it.

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,360
This side represents the Huanyun Tower.

60
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,559
This side represents the Wanguan Hall.

61
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,199
This is Fragrance Garden.

62
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,239
This is Huamanzhu.

63
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,279
Mr. Liu, you have searched the room
and checked the accounts.

64
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,160
Is there anything unusual?

65
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,399
Mr. Liu, that person appeared at the dock again.

66
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,879
Just like the previous times, after leaving,
he came to Wanguan Hall.

67
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,679
Upon seeing there were officers here,
he turned and went to another shop.

68
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,680
Was he really pawning something?

69
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,639
Yes, we obtained the item he pawned.

70
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,520
It is a gemstone smuggled from foreign lands.

71
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,199
Sir, do you not believe that person
is unrelated to Jiang Chang Yang?

72
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,679
Whether I believe it or not,
Prince Ning's opinion is what matters.

73
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,679
We must obtain concrete evidence
while Jiang Chang Yang is trapped.

74
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
Open the door.

75
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,879
[Jiang Mansion]
Open the door. Open the door.

76
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,879
Quick, open the door.

77
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,000
Open the door.

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Open the door.

79
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,319
Quickly, open the door.

80
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,360
Mr. Liu, you sent me back home,
and I naturally cannot disappoint your kindness.

81
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,200
I will definitely protect my home
with Jiang Chang Yang well.

82
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,159
Move aside.

83
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,279
As long as my husband is not convicted,

84
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,320
he remains the Floral Envoy and the Vice Minister
of the Office of Imperial Ceremonies.

85
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,000
If you want to search here,
you must ask for the imperial edict.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,480
What exactly is hidden in this Jiang Mansion
that makes you so concerned and protective?

87
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,728
Today, I will enter this door.

88
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:52,719
It is precisely because of its innocence that we
cannot allow a vile person like you to insult it.

89
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,039
Stop. This is an imperial granted sword.

90
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,399
The blade drawn is as if His Majesty is present.

91
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,400
I dare you to make a move!

92
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,480
Don't act willfully for someone unworthy.

93
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,880
Be careful not to bring disaster upon yourself,
or I won't be able to save you either.

94
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,759
He Wei Fang.

95
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,160
If you dare take another step forward,
I'll make sure you spill blood on the spot.

96
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,640
The poisoning case is closed.

97
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,159
Mr. Liu, the imperial edict
has arrived at Dali Temple.

98
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,279
The Vice Minister's improper appointment
of personnel bears the fault of negligence.

99
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,640
A three-year salary reduction
was issued as a warning to others.

100
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:09,719
Mr. Jiang has returned. Mr. Jiang has returned.

101
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,360
Lady Xiao is so impressive.
She merely said something and saved Mr. Jiang.

102
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
After all, she is the daughter
of a Military Governor.

103
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,240
She had the Royal Princess plead on her behalf.
What crime can't be cleared with that?

104
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,880
- Ms. He.
- Ms. He.

105
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,159
Let's go back first.

106
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,639
Oh, we're going back.

107
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,439
Yes, yes.

108
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,800
You didn't even greet your husband.
What a heartless concubine.

109
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,320
Well, did you bring my peonies back?

110
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,120
No matter what I forget,
I dare not forget your flowers.

111
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,240
Later, I'll have Chuan Yu bring them for you.

112
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,959
It's so good to be home.

113
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,839
The poisoning case ended in such a muddled way.

114
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,919
The witnesses involved either
took their own lives or were silenced.

115
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,000
The Dali Temple found nothing.

116
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,360
Moreover, the intrigue and rivalry
among concubines are nothing new.

117
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,320
There are plenty of such unresolvable cases.

118
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,919
Prince Ning found no evidence.

119
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,520
Seeing the Royal Princess plead,
it was difficult for him to obstruct.

120
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,199
This matter was greatly aided by Xue Xi.
You really ought to thank her properly.

121
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,160
And what about you?
How should I thank your great assistance?

122
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,040
Compared to Xue Xi, what I did was insignificant.

123
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,439
The famous Lady He in the capital
is not someone who underestimates herself.

124
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,280
I am neither ashamed nor humble.
I just feel somewhat powerless.

125
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,840
You once said I was a cunning fox
that could overcome any difficulty.

126
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,039
But no matter how hard a fox tries,
it can only handle matters on the shore.

127
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:55,839
When it comes to an injured fish in the water,
even if I want to save it, I am powerless.

128
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,039
But Xue Xi is different.
She has a similar background to yours.

129
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,720
She can look after you and support you.

130
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,959
You both live in the same lake.

131
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:23,679
Mu Dan, where they are born
does not determine their preferences.

132
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,320
How do you know I'm not another fox
that accidentally fell into the water?

133
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,559
Perhaps what I really need is for my companion
to give me a hand from the shore.

134
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,799
These days, you have worried
and run around for me.

135
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,960
You sent a message to Yun Niang, letting Liu Chang
see the fake account book I wanted him to see.

136
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,240
To stop Liu Chang from searching the mansion,
you bravely held the imperial sword to his neck,

137
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,080
forcing his men to draw their swords.

138
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,640
Every single matter
was a helping hand aiding me ashore.

139
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,639
You have the eyes of a clairvoyant.

140
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
Even in prison, you knew so much.

141
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,232
Yes, I do. So, even if
you don't say things, I know.

142
00:15:24,232 --> 00:15:26,568
♫ If love is like frost ♫

143
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:29,679
♫ How much of the past does it hold ♫

144
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,599
You disregarded the risk of being implicated
and did so much for me.

145
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Thank you.

146
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,679
♫ These billowing waves for ten thousand miles ♫

147
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,800
You said it before
that there's no need for thanks between us.

148
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,000
Then, you're responsible for dinner today.
Hurry up and start the stove.

149
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,959
I'll go bathe first. Call me when it's ready.

150
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,519
Liu Chang only found that She Yan was a thief,
coming to the Wanguan Hall to fence stolen goods.

151
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,960
Prince Ning did not succeed.

152
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,199
He also let us remove the spy
he planted next to Consort Shu.

153
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,759
In the past, when he meddled
with the harem, I could let it slide.

154
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,959
But this time, he tried to poison Ling Ge.

155
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,120
If Mu Dan didn't say anything, Ling Ge would be…

156
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,199
I'm afraid establishing the Crown Prince
has completely unsettled him.

157
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,719
For the safety of Ling Ge and Prince Lang,
let's not mention this for now.

158
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,319
The inner palace is not like other courtyards.

159
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,599
Your Majesty can take this opportunity
to thoroughly investigate the palace servants.

160
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,119
Exercise more caution in the future
to prevent such dangerous incidents.

161
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,160
Although Prince Ning didn't find anything,

162
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm afraid his naturally suspicious nature
will only deepen his mistrust.

163
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,039
If Prince Ning becomes completely suspicious,
he certainly won't take small actions like this.

164
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,440
Last night, I received an apology gift
from Prince Ning's Mansion,

165
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,160
saying that his son-in-law behaved inappropriately
and startled my household.

166
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,960
He also said that he wanted to enter the palace
to plead for me, but someone beat him to it.

167
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,319
Smooth talk and flattering words.

168
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,839
Fortunately, Xue Xi went to the Royal Princess,
so I took the opportunity to release you.

169
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,200
Otherwise, he would have claimed credit for it,
and who knows how he'll make you return the favor.

170
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,079
The probe against me was proposed
and carried out by Liu Chang.

171
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,440
If Prince Ning is suspicious,
he won't target only me.

172
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,320
Liu Chang hasn't found any concrete evidence.

173
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,319
So, if he still insists,

174
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,039
Prince Ning will only suspect
that he's targeting me because of Mu Dan.

175
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,400
Moreover, I just helped his man secure
the position of Minister of Revenue.

176
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,760
This tangible advantage is more credible
than a few baseless speculations by Liu Chang.

177
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,319
How is the investigation
into the canal transportation going?

178
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,079
Before General Yu arrives, the corrupt officials
in the Ministry of Revenue all need to be removed.

179
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,359
She Yan has already found
Prince Ning's smuggled goods.

180
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,760
Now they are investigating
where these items were transported to.

181
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
What are these mysterious items?

182
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:57,079
Consort Shu has returned to the palace.
Increased vigilance makes it hard to act again.

183
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,879
I'm afraid the Floral Envoy
will also bear a grudge against me.

184
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,039
Liu Zi Shu, you truly are a good son-in-law to me.

185
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:19,039
We haven't searched the Jiang Mansion, and it's
unclear if Jiang Chang Yang has ulterior motives.

186
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,319
What do you think?

187
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,599
Your Highness.

188
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,559
Everyone in Pingkang House knows the Floral Envoy.

189
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,960
All playboys of the major noble families
have attended banquets at the Jiang Mansion.

190
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,359
Zi Shu, have you seen the grandeur
of gift receptions at the Jiang Mansion?

191
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,919
For someone as greedy and self-indulgent,
I don't believe he is plotting revenge.

192
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,200
My son has recently become
obsessed with cockfighting.

193
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,960
He found out that Jiang Chang Yang has taken
all the high-quality ones to the palace.

194
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,079
His Majesty chose several members
of the imperial guard to raise chickens.

195
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,599
They have been doing it for quite some time.

196
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,480
Could all these years have been a guise?

197
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
It's precisely because he has been
consistent for many years

198
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,440
that we should thoroughly investigate
whether Jiang Chang Yang has ulterior motives.

199
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,208
If he truly had ambitions, why hasn't he
married a noblewoman who could assist him?

200
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:28,680
With the help of noble families,
isn't it easier to get things done?

201
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,200
Given today's circumstances, I'm afraid
Xue Xi already has feelings for Jiang Chang Yang.

202
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,559
Hurry up, and make sure to claim the Xiao family.

203
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
Yes.

204
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,400
Your Highness, do you truly have no doubts?
How could it be such a coincidence?

205
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,240
Jiang Chang Yang was released
right before I conducted the search.

206
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:10,799
How can a merchant's concubine keep
an important official outside the house?

207
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,639
Do you really think
that I don't know your intentions?

208
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,680
I have no second thoughts
about Your Highness or the County Princess.

209
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,599
If there are lies, I shall be like this cup.

210
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,039
Jiang Chang Yang is a clever person.

211
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:54,879
He can both please His Majesty
and lend me a hand at the right time.

212
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:03,960
But precisely because of this, should he become
my enemy, it will be an unfathomable abyss.

213
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,079
I allowed you to investigate thoroughly.
But what did you do?

214
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:14,519
You came back empty-handed,
and now I have to appease him.

215
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:19,960
I am so sorry, Your Highness.
I failed your trust this time.

216
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,559
Next time, I will not act rashly.

217
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,559
You must cherish your fragile body
and use the cane I gave you well.

218
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,279
Be more alert and do your work properly.

219
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:41,480
Do not get injured again.
Your becoming a cripple would distress You Zhen.

220
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,040
I understand and will not betray your trust.

221
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:01,319
This is Dong'e County's Ejiao
awarded by the Royal Princess. Keep it.

222
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,559
It's most nourishing when simmered into a soup.

223
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
Xue Xi, you are so kind.

224
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,079
You are an old acquaintance of the gentleman
and helped him leave the Dali Temple.

225
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,119
We should be thanking you.
How come you are the one giving gifts?

226
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,559
Staying temporarily at the Jiang Mansion was
the Royal Princess's idea. I hope you don't mind.

227
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,799
Of course not, aside from Mr. Jiang,
you also saved my life.

228
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,039
If my courtyard were not so small,
I would have invited you to stay here with me.

229
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,799
Xue Xi, if you have any discomfort,
just tell Jiang Chang Yang.

230
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,079
I also have everything a woman might need.

231
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,160
Mu Dan, you are indeed different
from other women as rumored.

232
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,880
These are our newly developed perfumes.

233
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,920
Xue Xi, take a look. Take whichever you like.

234
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,800
We also have lip balm
made from Herbaceous Peonies. Give it a try.

235
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,280
It smells so good.

236
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,919
What is this?

237
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,839
This is a scar-removing ointment.

238
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,519
Does Huamanzhu also sell scar-removing products?

239
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,759
Those are sold by Chun's Qingshuzhai.

240
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,680
We also have medicine
specifically for burns and scalds.

241
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,480
The one you are holding is specifically used
for scars left by sharp objects.

242
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,839
Small scars usually disappear
in about half a month with application.

243
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:33,240
That's impressive. Can it also smooth out
scars that are over ten years old?

244
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,000
Over ten years? We haven't tried that.

245
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,319
For typical scars, applying medicine
as soon as they form is the most effective.

246
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,480
Xue Xi, do you have any old scars?
You can take it back and try it first.

247
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,680
If it doesn't work,
I'll have Chun come over to take a look.

248
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,200
But you have reminded me.

249
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,359
We can develop another ointment
for removing old scars.

250
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,720
Have you talked to your father about Pei Zhong?

251
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,359
Father wanted to call off the engagement,
knowing who Pei Zhong really is,

252
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,000
but he's afraid of offending Prince Ning
by rejecting his good intentions.

253
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,400
Prince Ning wants to befriend the Xiao family.

254
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,639
Even without Pei Zhong,
there will be someone else.

255
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,559
Father often says

256
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,009
that the court is complex and unpredictable.

257
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:43,880
If one can stay unaffected, that is the best.

258
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,000
If not, you should also make fewer enemies.

259
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,879
This matter is difficult to handle.
Father still needs some more days to think.

260
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,720
Alright, now that you're staying here,

261
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,680
for the time being, it can prevent
some of Pei Zhong's harassment.

262
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,599
You were close to Prince Ning. Why did he send men
to check your assets when you were locked up?

263
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,960
Did you offend him in any way?

264
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,200
You should have heard
that Mu Dan was once Liu Chang's wife.

265
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,799
Ever since I took her in,
Liu Chang has been targeting me everywhere,

266
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,879
trying to drive a wedge
between me and Prince Ning.

267
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:42,079
Sui Zhi, do you remember when you took me
to catch rabbits in the mountains when we were 7?

268
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,039
Then you fell from halfway up the mountain

269
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,729
and got a deep cut on your lower back.

270
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,879
You bled so much.

271
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,200
We didn't catch any rabbits,
and you ended up with a very ugly scar.

272
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,039
I cried for a long time because of that.

273
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,759
Of course, I remember.

274
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,599
At that time, Mother was applying ointment
to me while comforting you.

275
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,960
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

276
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,839
She said

277
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,519
that this scar is hidden under clothes,
and no one but family can see it.

278
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,800
Only then did I stop crying.

279
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,399
But Mu Dan doesn't know that you have such a scar.

280
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,159
Do you have a fake marriage?

281
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:40,400
You're insightful and perceptive.
You figured it out so quickly.

282
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,680
Why did you do it?

283
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:51,200
At that time, Mu Dan was in danger.
To save her life, I had no choice but to do this.

284
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,480
And by having a beloved concubine,
I can also avoid some unwanted marriages.

285
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,520
Killing two birds with one stone.

286
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,879

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,359
- Okay.
- Look how beautiful these small flowers are.

331
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,559
Madam, come again next time.

332
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,359
Okay.

333
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,599
Shopkeeper, three boxes of bath beans
and incense powder for a total of 200 wen.

334
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,639
Liu Chang is coming. Run.

335
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,159
May I ask if He Wei Fang is here?

336
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,879
No. Mr. Liu, please go home.

337
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,520
It doesn't matter if she's not here.
I'm here to buy something.

338
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,040
Qiu Shi.

339
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,960
Your Highness, embroider tomorrow.
Be careful not to hurt your eyes.

340
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,760
Your Highness.

341
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:51,079
Mr. Liu carried several boxes of women's items
to the Taoguang Courtyard today.

342
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,159
Huamanzhu.

343
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,399
It's He Wei Fang again.

344
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,440
You know perfectly how many cold looks your mother
has shown me, both openly and secretly.

345
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,319
Now, even a lowly concubine dares to embarrass me.

346
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:42,480
Lady Man is a noble concubine
from the Lu family of Fan Yang.

347
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,440
Now she is pregnant, and you should
give way to her, you know?

348
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,400
Why can't you give way to me?
Today is my birthday.

349
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,680
If you don't stay with me overnight,
everyone in the mansion will laugh at me.

350
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,279
You haven't gotten pregnant yet,
so why should I care about your face?

351
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,960
You can't leave. You can't. You just can't.

352
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,240
Foolish woman.

353
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,279
Ping Zhi, how are you? Are you okay?

354
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,079
I'll call someone for you.

355
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,879
I'll divorce you, venomous woman.

356
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:44,479
The weather is dry and prone to fires.

357
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,680
Once the fire burns everything,
nothing will be left.

358
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:04,559
- Madam Tang.
- Is it delicious?

359
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:06,440
Come, Chun.

360
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Thank you, Fu.

361
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,584
And yours too.

362
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:09,928
Thanks.

363
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:11,039
- Another bonus.
- That's so nice.

364
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,800
Everyone, during the Dragon Boat Festival,
our prosperity was thanks to all of you here.

365
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Tonight, let's drink to our hearts' content
and rest well for a few days.

366
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,679
Here's to everyone.

367
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,800
Thank you, Owner.

368
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,600
Come on.

369
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,719
Shopkeeper, Mr. Jiang has sent something.

370
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,320
Come on, bring it over quickly.

371
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,840
- Put it here, put it here.
- It's from Mr. Jiang.

372
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,760
There are so many.

373
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,039
Ms. He, Mr. Jiang understands
the hardships you've endured.

374
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,440
He especially went to Fuguilou
and carefully selected these fine wines and foods

375
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,719
for everyone in the Fragrance Garden
to enjoy together.

376
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,559
Ms. He, there are still several boxes outside.

377
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,039
I'll distribute them to each courtyard
and take my leave for now.

378
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:56,239
Thank you.

379
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,760
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

380
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,880
Many thanks, Mr. Jiang.

381
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
So nice.

382
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,360
Alright now.

383
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,639
The Floral Envoy is being generous for once.
Everyone, come and try it.

384
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,920
- Quickly.
- Bring that chicken over to me.

385
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,239
- I can't even snatch from them.
- Just wait to eat.

386
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,440
Why are you acting so distant today?

387
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,199
Having such a considerate husband is rare,
so why don't you return home early?

388
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,519
How could I?

389
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:23,239
I promised to drink with you today,
so how can I go back on my word?

390
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,920
You have been staying here these days.

391
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,440
Mr. Jiang must miss you greatly. Quickly, go home.

392
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,200
This one night won't make a difference. I'll go
to the greenhouse to check on the peonies.

393
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,679
Father has already checked them, and he said
the new peonies you cultivated are thriving well.

394
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,119
One night won't make a difference.

395
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,800
Chun, Chun, come on.

396
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,280
Why is there so much food?

397
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
It's all from Mr. Jiang.

398
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,880
- Liu Lang, go and eat quickly.
- Okay.

399
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,039
Liu Lang, Liu Lang, come on.

400
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,679
Mu Dan, even if you're not going,
you should at least send your regards.

401
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,840
I have a sparring match with Chuan Yu,
and I'll return to Jiang Mansion shortly.

402
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,480
If you have something
to tell him, I'll pass it on.

403
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,559
Come on, let's drink together.

404
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,840
Madam Tang, let's drink.

405
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,920
Come on. Cheers.

406
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,439
- Come on.
- Okay.

407
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,559
Come on. Dig in.

408
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:13,400
Here, have some dishes.

409
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,399
Thinking of you is like the daylily,
seeing it dispels worries.

410
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,839
How did the busy Lady He think of me,
and even brought supper over?

411
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:41,280
This is to thank Mr. Jiang for treating everyone
at Fragrance Garden to the food of Fuguilou.

412
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,400
This is Mu Dan expressing gratitude
for her husband's care.

413
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,519
She also recited a line of poetry.

414
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:56,320
Thinking of you is like this grass something,
something about dispelling worries.

415
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:00,760
If you want to send flowers, just say so. Why lie?

416
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,480
When did I invite her people to Fuguilou?

417
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,440
Wait, didn't you send food with a servant?

418
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,479
There was a total of ten boxes
for everyone at the Fragrance Garden.

419
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,560
I didn't do anything.

420
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,160
Have you seen the servant who delivered the gifts?

421
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,039
Did you check the contents of the boxes?
Are they all food and drinks?

422
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,400
Mu Dan and I only checked two boxes,
and the rest were distributed to other rooms.

423
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,640
What? It's not from you?

424
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,760
Oh no.

425
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,280
Let's go.

426
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:23,480
[Fragrance Garden]

427
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,840
She secretly sent people to spy on me.

428
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Even though she knows I haven't seen Mu Dan,

429
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,920
she still wants to kill someone.

430
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,199
Truly malicious.

431
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:41,239
You were so worried that you rushed to rescue them
without changing your official attire.

432
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,519
Why not go in now?

433
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,800
A heaven-sent opportunity for me
to be a hero and save the damsel.

434
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,560
I should wait for the fire
to burn a bit more intensely.

435
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,239
Quickly, put out the fire, quickly.

436
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,039
Somebody, please.

437
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:08,439
Someone, please.

438
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,200
Stop there.

439
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,359
You're not allowed to go.

440
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,400
I've had enough of these days.

441
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,640
Only when she's dead
will you turn back and look at me.

442
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,159
Didn't you bring these days upon yourself?

443
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,319
If you hadn't started this fire,
I wouldn't have come here.

444
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,650
You are my husband.

445
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,920
If I won't let you in,

446
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,199
you are not allowed
to step into this Fragrance Garden.

447
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:00,039
It's not up to you.

448
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
You've come just in time.

449
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,239
Watch with me as she burns into charcoal
and turns to ashes in this great fire.

450
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,359
This way, you'll give up,
and you'll be with me forever.

451
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,079
Quickly, Owner, get out.

452
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,280
Owner, go out first.

453
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:38,639
Madam Tang, hurry.

454
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,920
Quickly, you go out first.

455
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,839
Get out first.

456
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:07,818
♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

457
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:16,232
