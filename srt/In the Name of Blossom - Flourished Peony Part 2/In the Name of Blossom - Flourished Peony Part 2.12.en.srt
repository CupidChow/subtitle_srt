1
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:37,950
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,920
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,039
Young Master.

4
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:55,382
Did he take the bait?

5
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,942
Yes. Vice Minister Lu boarded
Liu Chang's ship with his men.

6
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,160
Tie them up tight.

7
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,080
Everyone on board, listen up!

8
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,987
Line up immediately for inspection!

9
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,983
King Ning is suspected of smuggling,

10
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,920
so Young Master made Liu Chang
the Vice Commissioner of Transport.

11
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,679
They took the fat meat
offered straight to their mouths,

12
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,142
not realizing it might just
choke them on the bone.

13
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,302
After tonight, Prince Ning's financial
lifeline will be completely severed.

14
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,559
More than just his financial lifeline.

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,063
Did She Yan not tell you
what they were shipping?

16
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,862
Don't you know him?

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,080
He's tight-lipped.

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,520
He doesn't even talk in his sleep.

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,783
King Ning is incredibly ambitious.

20
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,702
To seize military power, he needs a
ready supply of standardized weapons.

21
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,520
What do you think he's been
using to manufacture the weapons?

22
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,663
Liu Chang is even daring enough
to smuggle copper and iron ore?

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
He's backed by King Ning.
What wouldn't he dare to do?

24
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,383
Young Master, this fish is
way too fishy for my taste.

25
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,422
Feed it to the stray cats.

26
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,823
Flower Bird Envoy caught a cold
while fishing for first catch of spring.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,462
I'll have to take leave tomorrow.

28
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,422
I won't get to see His
Majesty's fury in person,

29
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,840
nor Liu Chang being sent to jail.

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,057
Your plan has finally come
to fruition, Young Master.

31
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,453
You should rest a little.

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,663
And also to prevent King Ning's
fury from hurting innocent people.

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,840
Vice Minister Lu.

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,063
What's with such a large-scale operation?

35
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,223
Young Master Liu, I received a tip-off

36
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,015
that someone is violating
canal transportation regulations

37
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,919
by secretly shipping
prohibited goods at night.

38
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,093
I've come to investigate.

39
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,983
May I ask, Young Maser
Liu, why are you on this ship?

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,280
Vice Minister Lu, you must be joking.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,720
I am in charge of the canal transportation.

42
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,119
This shipment was
properly filed and approved.

43
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,742
How could there be any violation?

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,143
Lu, I'm afraid you've made a wasted trip.

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,240
So it was specifically
approved by Young Master Liu.

46
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:24,595
In that case, the informant must
have fabricated this to frame you.

47
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:26,160
Precisely.

48
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,786
Since I'm already on the ship,

49
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:30,678
a quick inspection should settle things.

50
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,262
If it turns out to be a false alarm,
I'll offer a sincere apology to you.

51
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,926
- Search! - Yes.

52
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:40,645
Wait.

53
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,920
Vice Minister Lu, you might
want to think this through.

54
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,262
I'm backed by King Ning.

55
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,520
If you interfere today, you will
make yourself King Ning's enemy.

56
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,240
Young Master Liu, please
don't make things difficult for me.

57
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm just doing my duty.

58
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,960
If there's nothing illegal here,

59
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,662
I'll pay a visit and apologize
to King Ning tomorrow.

60
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,190
- Search! - Yes.

61
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,080
The fourth watch has passed.

62
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,360
Why did Lu suddenly board the ship?

63
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,560
My Lord, Young Master Liu arranged
the shipment with utmost secrecy.

64
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,840
We truly don't know when it was exposed.

65
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:43,000
Utmost secrecy? They
already boarded the ship.

66
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,680
If they discover what's on board,

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,302
His Majesty will definitely find out
about our private Armory Workshop.

68
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,614
Rest assured, My Lord.

69
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,000
Young Master Liu is meticulous in his work.

70
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,520
Although our ship was intercepted,

71
00:05:58,856 --> 00:06:01,840
it doesn't necessarily mean
the whole operation is exposed.

72
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
Liu Chang, how do you explain this?

73
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,982
I admit my guilt, Your Majesty.

74
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,360
All you can say is that
you admit your guilt.

75
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:53,847
But tell me,

76
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,942
what's with these bronze and iron statues?

77
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:01,936
Your Majesty.

78
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,400
My father has always
believed in ghosts and spirits.

79
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,919
In recent years, he has
become even more superstitious.

80
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,720
After he was dismissed
from his post, he fell ill

81
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,494
and sought divine guidance everywhere.

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,520
That's how he came to
believe a master's advice

83
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,680
that he needed to invite 99 deities
to guard his home in order to recover.

84
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:22,680
Out of filial piety, I secretly
cast these deity statues,

85
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
intending to offer them to
my father as a birthday gift.

86
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:30,558
Am I supposed to praise
you for being a devoted son?

87
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
There are nearly 100 statues!

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,160
They were transported with
such great fanfare into the treasury.

89
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,157
The people along the way all saw it.

90
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,518
Now, the gossip is spreading everywhere.

91
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,520
How do you think this reflects on me?

92
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
As the Commissioner of Transport,
you abused your authority, broke the law.

93
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,143
Who will still dare to
trust officials, to trust me?

94
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,622
What Your Majesty says is true.

95
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,719
As far as I know,

96
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,500
since Minister Zheng took
office, he colluded with Liu Chang

97
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:02,884
to smuggle tribute goods and sell
large amounts of foreign artifacts.

98
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,663
At the same time, they accepted
bribes and shielded corrupt merchants.

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,944
Therefore, the common
people are suffering immensely.

100
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,262
Minister Zheng has been taking bribes?

101
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,502
Investigate him. This must
be thoroughly investigated.

102
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,302
Your Majesty, I've been wrongly accused.

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,676
Your Majesty, I've known
Shou De for many years.

104
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,116
I'm well aware of his character.

105
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,039
He would never bend
the law for personal gain.

106
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,983
There must be a misunderstanding here.

107
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,063
Since King Ning vouches for
Minister Zheng, I naturally believe him.

109
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,703
But Brother, how do you think

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,063
this should be handled?

111
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,882
Liu Chang!

112
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,983
You held great authority.

113
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,372
Instead of repaying royal favor, you
used the position for personal gain.

114
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:20,902
You should be severely punished.

115
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:24,839
Your Majesty,

116
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,720
please dismiss him from his position
as the Commissioner of Transport.

117
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,343
Brother, he's your dear son-in-law.

118
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,223
When it comes to state affairs, I
won't let personal ties interfere.

119
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,823
In fact, Liu Chang has
disappointed me and my daughter.

120
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,640
He should be punished even more severely.

121
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,343
Such noble self-sacrifice.

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,863
King Ning is truly a pillar of the nation.

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,080
Liu Chang.

124
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:00,176
Do you have anything else to say?

125
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,302
I admit my guilt, Your Majesty.

126
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
I have no excuse.

127
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,905
Very well.

128
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,320
Let's proceed as King Ning suggests.

129
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,103
And to reassure the people,

130
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,303
the canal transport system
must undergo a full reform.

131
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,655
Vice Minister Lu, since you
successful uncovered this,

132
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,039
the position of Commissioner
of Transport now falls to you.

133
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,502
Do it well.

134
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,622
You must put an end to
smuggling and corruption.

135
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,823
I shall accept the appointment.

136
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,840
Here.

137
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,183
Do you feel resentful?

138
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,960
I wouldn't dare.

139
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,879
Minister Zheng holds an important position.

140
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,006
I can't afford anything happens to him,

141
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,359
so I can only ask you
to make this sacrifice.

142
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,840
I understand.

143
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,823
But you did a good job this time.

144
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,680
Although the bronze and
iron statues were seized,

145
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,103
your father's obsession with deities
is well-known among the officials.

146
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,423
So the filial devotion
excuse still holds water.

147
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,542
If Vice Minister Lu
had truly found iron ore,

148
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
that would have been a huge problem.

149
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,782
This matter became widely known.

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,502
His Majesty was embarrassed and so
he demanded a thorough investigation.

151
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,223
However, it's just a show.

152
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,183
Once he finds new amusement in the future,

153
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,542
he will naturally forget about this.

154
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,502
At that time, I'll have plenty of
opportunities to bring you back to court.

155
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,983
Thank you for your consideration.

156
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,943
You need to keep a low profile recently.

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,782
Dissolve the Armory Workshop temporarily.

158
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,199
Each of you should lie low for a while.

159
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,520
Yes.

160
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,840
Oh, right.

161
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,862
Since you've been dismissed, you
can spend more time with the Princess.

162
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,782
That's a good thing.

163
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,664
I understand.

164
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,782
Alright, you can see me off here.

165
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,022
Lift the things carefully.

166
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,680
Mr. He.

167
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,343
I bought quite a few valuable
medicinal herbs from your shop.

168
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,351
Now that the He family
has fallen on hard times,

169
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,407
I don't want to drive you to ruin either.

170
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,754
But if you still can't pay your
debts by the fifth of next month,

171
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,437
these two boxes won't be
enough to solve the problem.

172
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,623
Yes.

173
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,742
Mr. Ding, thank you for your understanding.

174
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,744
Your eldest daughter is
doing so well in Chang'an.

175
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,142
Why didn't she send anything home for you?

176
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,664
If I hadn't seen your current
state with my own eyes,

177
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,622
I'd have thought you were
just pretending to be broke.

178
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,879
I shall take my leave now.

179
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,983
Take care, Mr. Ding.

180
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,782
Mr. Ding is insatiable.

181
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,398
We gave him two boxes of excellent
calligraphy and paintings for free.

182
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,223
And he still won't grant us an extension.

183
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,583
With such a large deficit,

184
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,782
how can we pay it back
by the fifth of next month?

185
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,103
Man, what's wrong?

186
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,000
What's wrong, Man?

187
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,782
Are you injured?

188
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,782
Man, why did you drop the plate?

189
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,542
The sugar crisp isn't tasty.

190
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,079
Don't eat it then.

191
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,480
I will make a new one for you.

192
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,943
None of them taste good. I
want pastries from Bifang Pavilion.

193
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,596
Alright, I'll have someone
buy them for you later, alright?

194
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,719
Buy what?

195
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,303
Everyone in the house is cutting back now,

196
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,560
but what about you?

197
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,862
You still think you're a rich young master?

198
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,622
Why are you telling him all this?

199
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,015
He's still young. He's a child.

200
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,519
How would he understand these things?

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,640
Still young?

202
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,303
When Mu Dan was his age,

203
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,902
she could not only read and write
but also help me with accounting.

204
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
I never had to worry about her.

205
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,902
What's the point of bringing that up now?

206
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,120
So what if He Wei Fang was that capable?

207
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,902
Does she even care about you?

208
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,902
Ever since she left for Chang'an,
all she has sent are a few letters.

209
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,943
She has never once come home to visit.

210
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,862
She's now the Chief
Flower Merchant of the State.

211
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
Fang Garden is practically
built on gold and silver.

212
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,280
Has she ever thought about sending
anything back to support this family?

213
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,622
Fang Garden was originally
left to her by her mother.

214
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,463
Back then, we sold the garden for business.

215
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,262
We owed her from the start.

216
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,063
Mu Dan must've suffered a
lot on her own in Chang'an.

217
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,902
Now, she has become the Chief
Flower Merchant by her own ability.

218
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,343
How could I possibly be so
shameless to ask for her help?

219
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,142
Shame?

220
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,600
You and your daughter
only care about shame.

221
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,902
Can it be used as gold or money?

222
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,622
Look around.

223
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,902
Don't you see how broke our family is?

224
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,983
If you ask me, if He Wei Fang
had even a shred of filial piety,

225
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,309
she should come back
with thousands of bolts of silk

226
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,476
and beg for our forgiveness.

227
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,879
You...

228
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,879
You're being completely unreasonable!

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,502
Mother, why is Father so angry?

230
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,839
This doesn't concern you.

231
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,262
Your father is just angry at your
sister for being ungrateful and unfilial.

232
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,000
What's the point in getting angry?

233
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,719
My sister is part of the He family.

234
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:33,248
If she did something wrong,
just deal with it by our rules.

235
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,542
She's not part of the He family.

236
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
She...

237
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,022
Man, you're right.

238
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,880
Man, you're right.

239
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,382
As long as your sister still
carries the He surname,

240
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,662
she can't walk away from us so easily.

241
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,223
Come, let me take you to buy pastries.

242
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:02,344
Let's go.

243
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,319
Take care.

244
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,782
Madam, this way, please.

245
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,839
Where is this place?

246
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,542
This is our future gold mine.

247
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,280
Aunt.

248
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,062
How has Father been lately?

249
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,079
He's doing well.

250
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,542
I'm glad to see how
well-off you are in Chang'an.

251
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,983
Your father constantly
thinks of you in Luoyang.

252
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,782
He specially asked me to bring
these flatbreads for you to eat.

253
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,542
Why didn't he come himself?

254
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,720
Mu Dan, you probably don't know about this.

255
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,983
The He family has been
bleeding money year after year.

256
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,423
Now there's hardly anything left.

257
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,023
Your father has been running
around trying to repay debts.

258
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,144
He can't spare the time to travel.

259
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,880
How is that possible?

260
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,783
Father used to be one of
the top merchants back then.

261
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,263
How did it get this bad?

262
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:33,075
You haven't forgotten

263
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,183
how much the family gave

264
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,543
to support your marriage
to Liu Chang, have you?

265
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,440
Then when you ran away from the Liu family,

266
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,663
everyone assumed you were dead.

267
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,906
Not only did the Liu
family stop helping us,

268
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:49,980
they started making trouble for us.

269
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,143
How could we fight against officials?

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,183
And everyone else just followed suit.

271
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,322
How were we supposed to do business?

272
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,240
Mu Dan.

273
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,320
Your current carefree and prosperous life

274
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,464
came at the cost of the
entire He family's well-being.

275
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,820
I understand.

276
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,022
I'll pack my things and go back to Luoyang

277
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,756
to discuss a solution with Father.

278
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,919
No.

279
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:21,912
You...

280
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,423
You know your father.

281
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,519
He can't bring himself to ask for
help, that's why he sent me to find you.

282
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,022
Even if you went back, he wouldn't see you.

283
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,423
But if I don't go back, how can I
help Father manage the business?

284
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,863
That's true.

285
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,864
You and your father...

286
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,223
I know you both care
deeply about each other.

287
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,276
Your father talks about you
all the time back in Luoyang.

288
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,983
He keeps saying he feels he owes you.

289
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,863
He said that when you were about Man's age,

290
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,317
you were already helping him count
money and manage the accounts,

291
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,822
and that you were very filial.

292
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,663
Now that Father is in trouble,

293
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,542
even if he won't see
me, I won't just stand by.

294
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,120
Here's what I'll do.

295
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,262
I'll send someone to
buy some jade and silk.

296
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,560
Take these back with you
to help ease things for now.

297
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,639
I'll try to get in touch with some
medicine merchants in Chang'an

298
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,663
and build some connections to help
get Father's business back on its feet.

299
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,920
Okay.

300
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,262
It warms my heart to
see how filial you are.

301
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,903
But all these solutions you mentioned

302
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,863
won't really fix the root
of the He family's troubles.

303
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,582
What do you mean?

304
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,663
I've been with your father for years.

305
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,983
I know a thing or two about business too.

306
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,423
There's no need to hide things from me.

307
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,623
Everyone in Chang'an knows that

308
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,863
Fang Garden is the source of your wealth.

309
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,342
My father didn't send you here.

310
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,550
Why are you saying that?

311
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,959
Of course your father sent me.

312
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,639
I know my father well.

313
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,542
He loved my mother deeply.

314
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,600
Mother cherished Fang Garden
the most when she was alive.

315
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:25,150
My father knows this very well.

316
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,558
There's no way he'd ask me to give it up.

317
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,063
Aunt, you came to Chang'an
behind Father's back.

318
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,846
You really went to a lot of trouble.

319
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,960
But unfortunately,

320
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,463
you won't get a single thing from me.

321
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,903
Fang Garden will never be yours.

322
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,253
Servants, see the guests out.

323
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,580
This way, please.

324
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,413
Mu Dan, you've misunderstood.

325
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,782
Mu Dan, the He family
really needs your help.

326
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,903
Look at Man. Look at your brother.

327
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,518
He's so young.

328
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:01,383
Can you really bear to see him
starve, to watch him suffer with us?

329
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,680
Ungrateful and unfilial woman.

330
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,639
I don't acknowledge you as my sister.

331
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,663
Don't say that.

332
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,102
Father was right about one thing.

333
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,502
When I was eight years old, I
followed him around doing business.

334
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,262
I could use the abacus
faster than the accountants.

335
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,502
If your son could do that,

336
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,183
he wouldn't let you starve yourself.

337
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,383
After all, he's filial, loyal and sensible.

338
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,302
Man is your father's only son.

339
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,623
One day, he'll inherit
the He family's business.

340
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,463
How can you belittle him so?

341
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,404
When he becomes the He family head,

342
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,582
you'll have to kneel and kowtow to
him when you return to Luo Yang.

343
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,223
What a joke.

344
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,559
I've already built a life of my own.

345
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,223
Who he becomes means nothing to me.

346
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,096
The person standing in
front of you is the owner of

347
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,335
Blooming Abode, the most
renowned flower shop in the capital.

348
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,519
You want to make her kneel?

349
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,080
Look at the calligraphy on that wall.

350
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:06,695
It was written by His Majesty.

351
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,302
I suggest you watch your tone.

352
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,557
You lowly maid...

353
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,720
Who are you calling a maid?

354
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,210
There are no lowly
maids in Fang Garden!

355
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:14,696
You...

356
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,301
If you don't leave now, don't
blame me for being rude.

357
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,040
He Wei Fang.

358
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,022
Has your conscience been eaten by dogs?

359
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:25,758
If you hadn't taken the precious
peony from the He family

360
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,956
when you ran away from home back then,

361
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,279
you wouldn't have had the
capital to build your fortune.

362
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,302
What? Now that you're successful,
you want to turn your back on us?

363
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,320
Let me tell you,

364
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,502
our He family rightfully deserves
a share of your immense wealth.

365
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,663
I started from nothing in Chang'an,

366
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,040
facing multiple crises and ups and downs,

367
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,983
and I never asked any of you for help.

368
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,663
And now you want a piece of the pie?

369
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,943
I'm telling you, the Jade Orchid
was planted by my mother.

370
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,743
Fang Garden was the dowry she left me.

371
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,902
If Father is in trouble, I'll
discuss it with him myself.

372
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,022
But none of this has
anything to do with you.

373
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,223
Guards, see the guests out!

374
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,400
I won't leave.

375
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,458
Don't touch me! I won't leave!

376
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,716
Don't touch my mother!

377
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,679
He Wei Fang, your
mother didn't die of illness!

378
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,280
Wait.

379
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,680
What did you say?

380
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,423
Your mother didn't
die of illness back then.

381
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,983
She was poisoned.

382
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,639
Let's go.

383
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,239
Go on.

384
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,262
She was poisoned by an enemy,
and this poison had no cure.

385
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:05,097
Only the Zixi Pills might've helped.

386
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,262
That's why your father risked
everything to get the imperial medicine.

387
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,582
Do you expect me to believe
this just because you say so?

388
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,102
My mother was kind to everyone.

389
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,920
She spent her life tending
flowers. She never wronged anyone.

390
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
Where did the enemy come from?

391
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:23,760
That's just what you think.

392
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,742
She not only had an enemy, but
that person hated her to the bone.

393
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,383
I suppose she knew her sins, so
she chose not to tell you about it.

394
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,423
Think about it carefully.

395
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,423
What kind of severe
illness would suddenly strike

396
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,342
and kill someone in just a few months?

397
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,143
You've worked with herbs
since you were young.

398
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,703
Have you ever seen a disease like that?

399
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,663
How do I know you're not lying?

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,302
I know who did it.

401
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,720
Give me 5,000 bolts of silk,

402
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,423
and I'll give you the name of that person.

403
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,502
You can investigate yourself.

404
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,480
Okay.

405
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:15,367
I agree.

406
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,062
Wu Hong is from Luoyang.

407
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,057
He used to work in a noble
household here in Chang'an.

408
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,264
A few years back, he
went home to visit family.

409
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,176
That was precisely the
time Madam He fell ill.

410
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,320
The dates match up.

411
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,463
Before he returned to Luoyang,
he had been living in Chang'an.

412
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,119
He shouldn't have had
any enmity with Mother.

413
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,423
Why would he harm Mother?

414
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,463
I couldn't find out.

415
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,143
But this man is very weird.

416
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,800
After he returned to Chang'an,
he disappeared for a while

417
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
and even changed his
name, living a secluded life.

418
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,983
If he had nothing to hide,
why would he do that?

419
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,262
Where is he now? What does he do?

420
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:57,896
He runs a hospice for orphans
and the sick outside the city.

421
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,383
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

422
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,384
The neighbors all praise him.

423
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,342
They say he's kind and
friendly, especially with kids.

424
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,759
Do you have a portrait of him?

425
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,159
Mu Dan.

426
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,984
Madam He is here.

427
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,143
It's cold outside. Come in and warm up.

428
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,400
No need.

429
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,943
I want to ask you something.

430
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,280
Please come out.

431
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:51,342
Kang, keep reading stories with the kids.

432
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,680
Okay.

433
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,863
Your real name is Wu Hong.

434
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,439
Yes or no?

435
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,720
Yes.

436
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,504
Do you know the owner
of the He family's pharmacy

437
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,839
in Luoyang?

438
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,960
Yes.

439
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,463
You were the one

440
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,542
who poisoned my mother.

441
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,360
Is that true?

442
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
It was me.

443
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:52,526
Why?

444
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,400
That year,

445
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,463
your mother wasn't the only one who died.

446
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,879
That year,

447
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,062
when I learned my home was hit by floods,

448
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,903
I rushed back to Luoyang.

449
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,262
I experienced the
plague after the disaster.

450
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,822
I couldn't do anything but watch...

451
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,943
I watched my parents,

452
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,879
my wife and child

453
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,943
died in front of me.

454
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,223
Have you ever experienced

455
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,383
the despair of losing your entire family?

456
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,742
But what does that have
to do with my mother?

457
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,822
The flood killed the poor.

458
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,022
The outbreak that
followed also killed the poor.

459
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,782
All the officials and rich merchants
hid in the mansions to avoid illness.

460
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,360
They could buy medicine
even if they got sick.

461
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,560
But what about us?

462
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,200
People like us

463
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,982
could only wait to die.

464
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,099
How can I not hate them?

465
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,240
Do you know

466
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,223
the last one to die in my arms

467
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,240
was my child, who hadn't
even reached adulthood?

468
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,360
Her eyes were wide open.

469
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,983
She couldn't rest in peace.

470
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,782
My heart was filled with hatred.

471
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,463
I just wanted to find
someone to die for my family.

472
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,822
But how could I reach a noble household?

473
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,183
I wandered everywhere

474
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,423
until I finally found a chance

475
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,943
to get into a noble household.

476
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,063
(Your mother)

477
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,262
(could tell that I wasn't the usual
farmer who brought them vegetables.)

478
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,863
(I told her my whole family had died, )

479
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,119
(and I had no money to bury them.)

480
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,383
(That's how I got the job.)

481
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,903
(She gave me two strings of coins.)

482
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,383
(But I didn't want her charity.)

483
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,342
(I didn't need her pretending
to be some kind-hearted saint!)

484
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,502
(I just wanted her to pay
with her life for my family!)

485
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,360
Your whole family was gone,

486
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,040
so you made my mother
pay with her life for your family.

487
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,062
My mother never hurt anyone.

488
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,476
And yet your family stayed
whole while mine was destroyed!

489
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,797
Why should that be?

490
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,423
If you must blame someone,
blame your mother for being unlucky!

491
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,582
It was my mother's compassion
that gave you the chance to kill her!

492
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,742
You were wrong,

493
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,342
and you still feel no remorse!

494
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,302
Since you've found me,

495
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,663
I guess it's my fate.

496
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,200
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

497
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,262
I won't resist.

498
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,359
Mu Dan.

499
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,400
Sui Zhi.

500
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:34,440
She's already gone. What good
will it do to kill Uncle Wu now?

501
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,679
You knew?

502
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,742
Why didn't you tell me?

503
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,262
Why didn't you tell me?

504
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,440
When will this cycle of vengeance ever end?

505
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,920
Even if you kill him,

506
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,662
your mother won't come back.

507
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,623
Jiang Chang Yang.

508
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,582
You and I both lost our mothers.

509
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,824
I thought you of all
people would understand.

510
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,080
Move.

511
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,023
I said move!

512
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,840
Sui Zhi!

513
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,280
You're crazy.

514
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,983
Have you lost your mind, Jiang Chang Yang?

515
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,703
Let the past stay in the past.

516
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,983
Uncle Wu is a pitiful man too.

517
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,640
Mu Dan.

518
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,599
Let it go.

519
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,784
Pitiful man?

520
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,703
Wasn't my mother a pitiable person too?

521
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,183
When my mother was gravely ill,

522
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,720
she told me to treat the servants well,

523
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,183
especially Uncle Wu.

524
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,160
All these years,

525
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,399
Uncle Wu has lived a difficult life,

526
00:34:09,686 --> 00:34:12,686
caring for the children in the courtyard.
He has been atoning for his sins.

527
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,000
Atone?

528
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,472
Can atonement bring my mother back to life?

529
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,662
Can atonement change
the fact that he's a murderer?

530
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,051
My mother had been kind all her life.

531
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:30,028
She made so many herbal sachets

532
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:33,078
and gave them to disaster victims
who couldn't afford medicine.

533
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:37,359
The murderer who killed my
mother is standing right here,

534
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,823
and you want me to let it go?

535
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,640
I can't let go.

536
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,600
I can't let it go!

537
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
All these years,

538
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,622
Uncle Wu watched me grow up.

539
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,239
He stood by me when we buried my mother.

540
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,463
He's like family to me now.

541
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,383
I can't let you hurt him.

542
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
Madam He.

543
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:27,957
Uncle Wu.

544
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,319
Say no more.

545
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,480
Jiang Chang Yang.

546
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,982
Only now do I realize that

547
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,275
you're someone who
can't tell right from wrong,

548
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,743
and unreasonable.

549
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,583
I was wrong about you.

550
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,582
Young Master, Madam He
moved out of Jiang Residence.

551
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,182
Sirs, please come in.

552
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,900
Mother.

553
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,222
The pharmacy must be
short-handed right now. I want to help.

554
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,062
After the flood, illness is
spreading across the city.

555
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,502
Your father has told us not
to go out for the time being.

556
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,702
But there are so many patients now.

557
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,222
They definitely need care.

558
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,863
And here I am, comfortably hiding at home.

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,704
I just can't feel at ease.

560
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,903
Right now, there are many sick
people outside and not enough medicine.

561
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,502
If you get sick, and take
up a dose of medicine,

562
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,383
that's one less for another patient.

563
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,983
Besides, by making these herbal sachets,

564
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,783
we're doing our part for
the sick common people.

565
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,400
Mother, you're right.

566
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,182
But Mother, is this outbreak
really so severe this time?

567
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,182
Usually, ordinary peonies
are enough for the medicine,

568
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,359
but this time we're
using ice crystal peonies.

569
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,423
The flowers in the
garden are almost all gone.

570
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,863
The root bark of this flower can
clear heat, cool blood, and relieve pain.

571
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,343
Combined with Anemarrhena,
Phellodendron, and Rehmannia,

572
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,222
it can soothe lung fever,

573
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,400
which is exactly the most
needed medicine for this epidemic.

574
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,542
Our ice crystal peonies are
incredibly rare and precious.

575
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,182
In times of disaster like these,
even one is worth a fortune right now.

576
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,423
Mother, you're giving them
away to victims who can't afford it.

577
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,919
Mother, you're the best.

578
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,240
The print of auspicious
cloud on the sachets

579
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:29,160
also carries a wish for good fortune.

580
00:41:29,392 --> 00:41:31,600
May all who take this medicine

581
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:35,360
be healthy and safely
pass through this calamity.

582
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:37,120
They certainly will.
