1
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:38,075
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:41,080
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:48,502
My private vault is guarded by three shifts day and night.

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,582
How could mere pirates sneak in and steal from it?

5
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,422
Besides, no one reported any theft.

6
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,422
I assume those pirates are just making it up.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,422
They claimed the paraffin was so rare,

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,249
so they hid a jar beforehand for later use.

9
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,542
We'll bring them up in a moment.

10
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:13,263
Once we compare the two samples of paraffin, it will all be clear.

11
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,983
Why did the pirates

12
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,182
set your courtyard on fire without any reason?

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,422
They were hired by someone to do so.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,742
Who was so bold

15
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,582
to harm my Flower Bird Envoy?

16
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,943
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,543
According to the pirates,

18
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,702
it was Princess Ji'an.

19
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,640
Your Majesty,

20
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,503
I've never seen this person before.

21
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,057
This is slander.

22
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,182
You Zhen is a sheltered lady.

23
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,343
She wouldn't know anything about paraffin.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,063
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,261
If you say so,

26
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,047
of course I believe you.

27
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,142
Pirates are all liars.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,622
They probably stole the paraffin

29
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,343
and wanted to frame you for it.

30
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,145
But now,

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,462
we have only 50 barrels of paraffin left. We can't verify it.

32
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,383
Besides, we don't know how much they stole.

33
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,263
If they have kept more than a jar,

34
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:31,711
if they have other accomplices,

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,142
Chang'an City will be in grave danger.

36
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,976
Jingzhao Fu can stop investigating this case and

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,752
hand it over to the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review.

38
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:46,459
When was the paraffin confiscated?

39
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,263
How long was it kept at the warehouse? Who was in charge?

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,943
Do the pirates have any accomplices?

41
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,400
Do they have any other dangerous items in possession?

42
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,943
Investigate this case thoroughly.

43
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,462
Yes, Majesty.

44
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,719
They don't have to do that.

45
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:08,365
I'm the one who did it.

46
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:12,508
Your Majesty.

47
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,383
I was upset at my husband for taking care of his ex-wife.

48
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,983
I let my anger get the better of me

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,262
and plotted this revenge.

50
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,302
I stole the paraffin from your warehouse

51
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,599
and hired someone to burn down Fang Garden.

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,409
You Zhen.

53
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,143
That was foolish of you.

54
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,585
Now, the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review are involved.

55
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,007
I don't wish to smudge my father's name

56
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:35,727
and put him in a difficult position

57
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,279
because of my own mistake.

58
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,666
I live in fear

59
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:41,039
and deep regret now.

60
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,903
Please forgive me.

61
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,822
Before this, Liu Chang searched my inn for no reason.

62
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:52,079
Now, Princess Ji'an burned down my garden.

63
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,688
You and your husband took turns to cause me trouble.

64
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,356
Is someone jealous because Mu Dan and I

65
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,463
are deeply in love and making a lot of money?

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,182
Please uphold justice for you, Your Lordship.

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,103
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare step foot into King Ning's residence anymore.

68
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,592
Sui Zi, don't worry.

69
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,211
I will

70
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,512
give you the justice you deserve.

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,989
No one is above the law,

72
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,103
even the princess.

73
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,788
You Zhen was in the wrong

74
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,223
this time.

75
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,598
If she's not punished,

76
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,000
we won't be able to appease the public outrage.

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,708
Magistrate Ren,

78
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,439
You can punish her according to the law.

79
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,262
According to the law, the punishments for arson

80
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,956
are three years of hard labor

81
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,431
and to be sent into exile 2000 miles away.

82
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,519
Okay.

83
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,029
But

84
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,862
since Her Highness turned herself in,

85
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,143
her sentence can be reduced.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,023
How about

87
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:06,511
we sentence her to corporal punishment as a warning to all?

88
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,143
What do you think, Your Majesty?

89
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,183
You've set a great example

90
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,463
for upholding justice over kinship.

91
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:25,496
But no matter what,

92
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,502
You Zhen is still my niece.

93
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,062
A public execution will bring shame upon the royal family.

94
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,319
We will punish her privately in the palace

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,023
and explain it to the people.

96
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,862
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,223
Sui Zhi is the victim of this case.

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,783
Are you satisfied

99
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,683
with this outcome?

100
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,136
Brilliant judgment and decisive action.

101
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,742
I'm very glad about the outcome.

102
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,720
Although this punishment can appease the public outrage,

103
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,143
The funds for repairing the garden

104
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:54,783
haven't been secured yet.

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,343
I'll send someone to deliver the funds

106
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
to your residence tomorrow

107
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,502
to repair the Fang Garden.

108
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:04,568
Thank you, Your Lordship.

109
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,422
Your Highness,

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,822
it's time.

111
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,943
Did the fire at Fang Garden burn brightly?

112
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,478
Isn't it interesting to watch the flowers

113
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,351
burning in the fire?

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,405
Thanks to you,

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,262
the fire created a new product, the Scorched Bone Crimson Ruby.

116
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,423
And it also scorched your body.

117
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,423
What goes around, comes around.

118
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,223
It's indeed interesting.

119
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,303
How dare a merchant

120
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,583
talk to me like this!

121
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,806
So what if I'm punished this once?

122
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,063
I'm the princess of this empire.

123
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,263
If I wish to take your life one day,

124
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,463
do you think you can stay alive?

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,880
When we cooperated in Luoyang, you knew I had no feelings for Liu Chang.

126
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,862
Why did you keep hurting me again and again?

127
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,706
Because of you,

128
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,502
I can never give birth again.

129
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:04,841
Because of you,

130
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,303
Zi Shu refuses to even glance at me.

131
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:11,127
Do you know how it feels to be in a living hell

132
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:13,704
where your husband is so indifferent to you?

133
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,902
As long as Zi Shu can't forget about you,

134
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:21,767
it's a sin

135
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:24,303
for you to stay alive.

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,823
But you didn't harm just me.

137
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,656
What about those innocent people in Fang Garden?

138
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,022
What did they do wrong?

139
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:34,223
They are just ants

140
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,333
who have the same status as you.

141
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,951
Their lives

142
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,983
have nothing to do with me.

143
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,610
In your eyes,

144
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,943
the people are just ants.

145
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,142
But you are able to enjoy this luxurious life

146
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,463
because of the hard work that these ants put into building this empire.

147
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,983
You are so obsessed with someone who doesn't love you.

148
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,103
And you've become a monster drenched in blood.

149
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,500
Isn't that a tragedy?

150
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,792
How can you call it love

151
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:18,303
if there's no obsession?

152
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,904
You don't know what I went through!

153
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,742
It hasn't been easy for women to make a standing in life.

154
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,824
Some are used as pawns in the struggle for power.

155
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:40,468
And some

156
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,823
can only act as a toy for men's entertainment.

157
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,822
And some are even treated like objects

158
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,470
that can be discarded without any care.

159
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Many times, we have no choice.

160
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,451
If that's the case,

161
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,583
when we have the choice,

162
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,183
why don't we live for ourselves?

163
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:02,967
Why make things difficult for each other?

164
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,089
Excessive rigidity will break you.

165
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:27,736
And excessive obsession will blind you.

166
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,063
The world is vast, he is not the only one you can love.

167
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,400
There's much more that you can do.

168
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,862
Please be wise from now on

169
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,538
and stop hurting others and yourself.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,093
Mu Dan.

171
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,662
These are the last of them.

172
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,262
Da Fu, you've worked hard all these days.

173
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,833
- Thank you for helping me with the move. - You are welcome.

174
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,735
When you first married Lord Jiang,

175
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,223
he was so sweet to you as if you were his whole world.

176
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,463
Now, he's engaged with another woman so quickly.

177
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,556
You worked so hard to make money for him.

178
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,879
How could he chase you out instead of treating you well?

179
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,187
He has no conscience.

180
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:16,548
You've misunderstood him.

181
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,159
Jiang Chang Yang didn't chase me away.

182
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,879
I'm the one who wants to leave. It has nothing to do with him.

183
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,502
Why are you still defending that heartbreaker?

184
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:25,188
It's true.

185
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,999
Jiang Chang Yang is not a person like that.

186
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,319
He kept saying that the dwarf peony was useless.

187
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:31,984
But he tried so hard to save the flowers

188
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,103
despite fearing the fire so much.

189
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,015
There are a lot of things

190
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:40,782
between us that only we know.

191
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:43,141
Anyway,

192
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:44,694
he's a great man.

193
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,463
The world has misunderstood him too much.

194
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:48,862
Don't blame him.

195
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:56,511
It's hard to understand the relationship between a man and a woman.

196
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,040
But since you've said that, I'll trust you.

197
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,178
I just hope

198
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:03,909
that you won't be too upset.

199
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,184
Treat yourself better.

200
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,943
Don't worry. I'm doing good.

201
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,338
(Jiang Chang Yang)

202
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,943
Has Lord Jiang regretted letting you go? Will he ask you to stay?

203
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:21,800
Come, Da Fu. Give that to me.

204
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,503
Go in and check if we've missed anything.

205
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,033
Go.

206
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,943
I've come back to pack my things.

207
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,513
I'll return these to you.

208
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,040
I'll take this concubine dismissal letter.

209
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,856
You need to fill in the name for it to be valid.

210
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,302
I can do that now. Where's the ink and brush?

211
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,848
I didn't prepare them.

212
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,990
What is the meaning of this?

213
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,432
You are going to get married soon.

214
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,703
It's improper for me to stay here any longer.

215
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,383
Don't worry. I'll explain it to Xue Xi.

216
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,856
I won't let her misunderstand us.

217
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,383
Who says I'm marrying Xue Xi?

218
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,075
She and I are just like sister and brother.

219
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:32,022
Are you leaving because of that?

220
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,300
No...

221
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,983
It's not just because of this.

222
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:45,354
No matter what your reasons are,

223
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,000
everything is just a misunderstanding.

224
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:50,822
Princess Royal didn't grant me a marriage and I won't marry Xue Xi.

225
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,120
I've chased out everyone from the Ministry of Works.

226
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:56,459
As long as Jiang Residence still exists,

227
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,102
this courtyard will always be yours.

228
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:05,953
You know

229
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,160
that I've vowed to stay single my whole life.

230
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:11,945
I won't marry anyone else.

231
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,187
Are you sure

232
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,062
you have no one you love?

233
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,350
No.

234
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,104
It's it nice to live freely

235
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,302
with no strings attached?

236
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,503
Yes.

237
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,495
It's quite nice

238
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,130
to live freely.

239
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,102
King Ning and Li You Zhen

240
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,623
will bear a grudge against us for the paraffin case.

241
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,029
If you move out right now,

242
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,560
not only will that rouse their suspicion,

243
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,664
your life will be in danger too.

244
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,872
I know.

245
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,719
This is an expedient measure.

246
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,920
I know it's unfair. But please bear with it for a while.

247
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,473
Keep this concubine dismissal letter.

248
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,103
When your safety is no longer threatened,

249
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,480
you can fill in the date at any time

250
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,397
and leave.

251
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,254
You are such a loyal man,

252
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,063
how is this unfair for me?

253
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,423
At this point,

254
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,022
the slightest movement in Jiang Residence

255
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,983
will be used by King Ning against us.

256
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,502
We need to be cautious.

257
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,679
If we are going to continue with our act,

258
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,151
we can't keep

259
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:12,903
this evidence, right?

260
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,582
How are You Zhen's wounds?

261
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,856
After using the medicinal cream from His Majesty, they have scabbed over.

262
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
According to the physician, they won't leave a scar.

263
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,824
It's truly unfair for You Zhen

264
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,582
to be punished like this.

265
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,502
And only you

266
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,102
can soothe her.

267
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,507
I understand.

268
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,502
I'll keep You Zhen company.

269
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,662
Your Lordship.

270
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:21,575
You Zhen was punished.

271
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:22,911
The paraffin was confiscated.

272
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,200
Even the Armory Workshop outside of the city

273
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,502
has stopped operating.

274
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,903
Do you still believe that Jiang Chang Yang is not behind these?

275
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,022
His Lordship has asked me to investigate the matter in secret.

276
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,582
The losses we have suffered over the years

277
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,383
were not caused by him.

278
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,679
When I came to the capital city to take office,

279
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,582
I went to visit Jiang Residence.

280
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,439
That time, Jiang Chang Yang kept hinting between the lines

281
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,302
that I should give him some benefits.

282
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,756
In my opinion, he doesn't care

283
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,262
who's controlling the court,

284
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:02,828
He only cares

285
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,102
about how much money he has.

286
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,951
Better to judge the heart than appearances.

287
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:14,127
Better to judge by competence than by motive.

288
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,080
Jiang Chang Yang keeps saying

289
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,136
that he cares only for money and beautiful ladies.

290
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,920
It seems like there's no chink in his armor.

291
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:22,508
But the outcome is,

292
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,983
His Lordship has suffered a great loss.

293
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,463
You are right, Zi Shu.

294
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,102
It doesn't matter if he's doing this on purpose or not.

295
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,183
We have to investigate him.

296
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,027
A wise decision.

297
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,623
Jiang Chang Yang has indulged in pleasure for years.

298
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,782
Everyone is unguarded around him.

299
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,782
If everything is just his pretense,

300
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,423
based on how close he is with His Majesty,

301
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,423
isn't it terrifying?

302
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,302
No action goes without a trace.

303
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,283
Where do you think

304
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,542
he'll leave a trace?

305
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,782
Before this, we couldn't search Jiang Residence

306
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,062
because Princess Royal vouched for him.

307
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,022
And I failed to send new spies

308
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,822
into his residence.

309
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,143
Now, there's only one who knows Jiang Residence

310
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:16,822
the best.

311
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,694
To make up for her failure, Lian Zhou

312
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,183
volunteered to go to Lord Pei's residence.

313
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,563
As for the rewards she received,

314
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,223
she took all the valuable things and left these behind.

315
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,010
Lian Zhou is not favored.

316
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,479
She lives a lonely life in Jiang Residence.

317
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,383
When she's free, she'll paint the scenery of the garden

318
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,709
on her fan.

319
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,022
How is Consort Shu lately?

320
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:13,415
Your Majesty.

321
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,176
After using the fragrance sachet from Miss He,

322
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,896
She can sleep more than eight hours every night.

323
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,320
Her appetite has gotten better too.

324
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,146
Then I'm glad.

325
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,903
After giving birth, she hasn't been weak.

326
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,575
Although the weather is hot, don't overindulge in cold food.

327
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,943
Eat less chilled lychee.

328
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,743
Remember to give her a warm foot bath before sleep.

329
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,883
I'll get going now.

330
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,782
You played this round beautifully.

331
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:24,490
Someone is restless.

332
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,319
They are going to take the next step.

333
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,062
Are you playing with the Go game or riddles?

334
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,863
You are unfathomable.

335
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,239
San Lang, not only are you dashing and talented,

336
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,295
but you also have unparalleled chess skills.

337
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,502
You are indeed extraordinary.

338
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,159
You are such a sweet talker today.

339
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,279
Is it because you want to persuade San Lang to purchase your goods again?

340
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,302
Why can't Mu Dan compliment me?

341
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:57,102
Yes. I've always known that San Lang is an extraordinary person.

342
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,799
He's unlike any of your other riffraff friends.

343
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,623
You'll definitely become famous one day.

344
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,736
Can you create a calligraphy masterpiece for me?

345
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,023
I wish to decorate my Blooming Abode with it.

346
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,223
Can you write something like "World's Best" for me?

347
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,877
That's easy. You have a few shops, right?

348
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,502
- Yes. - I'll write one for each.

349
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,789
Great.

350
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,119
- Very good. - Wait.

351
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,918
You are acting strange today.

352
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,520
Did something happen when you entered the palace just now?

353
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,863
I'm anxious when I think

354
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,022
about entering the palace.

355
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,822
I'm really worried about Consort Shu's illness.

356
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,944
What's wrong with Consort Shu?

357
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,663
Consort Shu has come down with a strange illness.

358
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,302
It's difficult to treat

359
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,983
but it's not impossible.

360
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,903
We need a catalyst.

361
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,502
But that catalyst is difficult to find.

362
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,424
What kind of catalyst?

363
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,052
This is the catalyst.

364
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:39,672
Young Master, King Ning is here.

365
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,181
Your Lordship.

366
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,535
If you kill me

367
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,262
and I survive,

368
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,623
the blood in Emperor Qin

369
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:03,143
will be tainted.

370
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,863
I'm willing

371
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,542
to prove your innocence

372
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,183
with my life.

373
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,580
Your Lordship,

374
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,623
the chancellor has contributed a lot to the empire.

375
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,863
You shouldn't kill him.

376
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,383
Please reconsider.

377
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,223
All these years,

378
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,732
he has

379
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,080
governed the state and written many scholarly works.

380
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,410
Sui Zhi.

381
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,316
Here's to you.

382
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,342
You Zhen and Zi Shu's childish acts

383
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,822
have broken your peace.

384
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:45,638
May the good food, good drinks,

385
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,232
and this good show

386
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,582
can appease your anger.

387
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,663
I hope you won't let those things affect our friendship.

388
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:56,217
You are being too harsh on yourself.

389
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:58,151
You've been so kind to me.

390
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,654
Why would I blame you?

391
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:02,936
Let's not talk about these unhappy things.

392
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,674
Let's just drink.

393
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,404
Cheers.

394
00:30:09,632 --> 00:30:10,912
Just now,

395
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,416
I heard that you prepare some gifts

396
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,502
for Sui Zhi as an apology.

397
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,102
You brought in so many chests.

398
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:20,102
I thought a beautiful lady would appear.

399
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:21,786
But in the end,

400
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,742
we just have these puppets.

401
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:28,615
I hear that Sui Zhi loves a puppet show.

402
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,856
When I found out that there was a new puppet show,

403
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
I brought it here right away to share the joy.

404
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:35,183
Sui Zhi, do you love this show?

405
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,240
Thank you for thinking about me.

406
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,708
But I prefer

407
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:42,062
romance between men and women.

408
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,542
It's boring to see a group of men

409
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,302
fighting for power.

410
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,863
The chancellor has passed away!

411
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:10,524
Chancellor Lv

412
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,383
governed the nation for the first emperor as regent.

413
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,623
He sacrificed his whole life for the Great Qin.

414
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,689
But in the end,

415
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,223
this was his fate.

416
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,737
How pitiful.

417
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,350
How unfortunate.

418
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,302
I dislike this first emperor.

419
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,143
He's cruel, tyrannical,

420
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,000
and repay kindness with enmity.

421
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,302
When I look at Chancellor Lv,

422
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,262
I feel mournful

423
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,342
over the downfall of a noble man.

424
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,022
I'm getting old too.

425
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,879
It's time

426
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,223
for me to retire from office.

427
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,584
You worry too much.

428
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,822
His Majesty and you are brothers.

429
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
How can you compare your brotherhood

430
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,761
to the first emperor and Chancellor Lv?

431
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,445
Brother.

432
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,437
Brother.

433
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:09,659
Your Majesty.

434
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,231
All these years,

435
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,663
you've helped me so much.

436
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,383
All the officials in the court are giving me a headache.

437
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,223
The state officials have so much to report as well.

438
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,627
I can't

439
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,742
live without you.

440
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,463
We share the same blood.

441
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,897
Brother.

442
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,663
You have to help me.

443
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,262
Your Majesty, I have to manage all the affairs at the court

444
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,542
and the affairs at home.

445
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,582
I'm exhausted.

446
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,943
I can't do this alone.

447
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,742
We haven't

448
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,983
talked like this in a long time.

449
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:00,262
Brother.

450
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:05,636
Sui Zhi,

451
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,046
I hear

452
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,360
that you have fantastic wine in your residence.

453
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,623
I've just gotten 10 barrels of high-quality Shidongchun wine.

454
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,188
Let me get it for you.

455
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,077
Let's drink until we drop today.

456
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:19,750
- Good. - Sui Zhi.

457
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,463
You don't have to get it yourself.

458
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,319
I just have to ask my men to get it for us.

459
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:26,697
There's no need to trouble you. I'll go and get it.

460
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,836
Sui Zhi.

461
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,742
Jiang Residence is not a maze.

462
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,520
Do you think my men

463
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,782
can't even find a barrel of wine?

464
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:54,789
Here's your reward!

465
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,143
Thank you, Your Lordship.

466
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:02,438
Brother.

467
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,223
I'm drunk.

468
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,360
Assistant Historian Liu, this...

469
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,073
His Lordship has invited us here

470
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,463
to find some wine.

471
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,073
Roger that.

472
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,376
Since we have great wine and a great show today,

473
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,040
let me play a song for Your Majesty and King Ning.

474
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,783
Isn't it better to have some music with wine?

475
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,236
Good.

476
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:51,268
Bring me my guqin.

477
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,974
Right away.

478
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,783
The painting on this fan is the dwellings in Jiang Residence.

479
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,983
Theoretically, the structure of a residence is mirrored.

480
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,200
There are windows in the west courtyard.

481
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,263
But the east courtyard has only walls.

482
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,240
The stone foundation underneath is also slightly different.

483
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,182
There's probably a secret room

484
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,022
behind the walls.

485
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,222
Please allow me

486
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,022
to search Jiang Residence.

487
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,383
The side hall has two doors, four windows. Similar to the west courtyard.

488
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,360
- The guest room has one door, two windows. - Assistant Historian Liu.

489
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,575
All the good wine in Jiang Residence is here.

490
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,319
You can pick what you want. There's no need to bring so many people.

491
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,622
The fine wine has been kept for a long time.

492
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,040
Maybe some have been overlooked.

493
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,222
I'd better look for the wine myself.

494
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,663
Madam He's courtyard is just nearby.

495
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,199
She has been deeply troubled

496
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,222
by the renovation of Fang Garden lately.

497
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,775
She needs her peace and quiet.

498
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:35,142
How about you have a seat in the side hall? I'll ask Madam He...

499
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,263
Since Madam He is unwell,

500
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,863
she should rest well.

501
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,343
This is between us men.

502
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,463
There's no need to trouble her.

503
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,182
Sui Zhi has given us his permission.

504
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,207
You are disrespecting your master's order.

505
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,943
Or do you have no respect for His Lordship?

506
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,868
I wouldn't dare.

507
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,606
But

508
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,423
we have too many imperial gifts in the residence.

509
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,640
I'm worried that you won't be able to compensate us if you break them.

510
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,880
- How about I... - No need to do that.

511
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,495
Search the place.

512
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,223
Sui Zhi has improved so much

513
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,142
at playing the guqin.

514
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:45,799
Brother.

515
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,222
Don't just listen to the music. Let's drink.

516
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,182
- Your Majesty. - Have a seat, Brother.

517
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,526
Brother.

518
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,182
We are almost out of wine.

519
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,983
When will your men return?

520
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,502
Be patient.

521
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,743
It'll take more time

522
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,158
to get the fine wine.

523
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:07,142
Enough.

524
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,142
This is your best song.

525
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,662
How could you play it wrongly?

526
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:30,383
Have you gotten rusty or are you

527
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,142
troubled by something?
