1
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,063
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,920
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,698
Grilled lamb!

4
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,955
You can smell it from ten li away!

5
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,435
Have a look and try it.

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,315
It's cloudy.

7
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:02,883
I think it might snow later.

8
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,360
Let's go back after buying dates for Da Fu.

9
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,719
Taste it and take a look!

10
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:10,076
Fresh vegetables and fruits!

11
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,095
Madam.

12
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,787
I'll wait for you here.
Return as soon as possible.

13
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:17,452
Yes.

14
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,556
Be careful.

15
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,635
Who sent all of you here?

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,435
What are you trying to do

17
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,356
by distracting my guard?

18
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,715
How do you know?

19
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,116
The thief did not steal my money pouch

20
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,875
but took my token of love instead.

21
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,796
If you knew bad people were coming for you,

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,155
why did you still ask your
guard to go after the thief?

23
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,475
Your target is me.

24
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,755
If the first plan fails,

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,276
you'll still have another plan.

26
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,715
Madam, you are wise indeed. What a pity.

27
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,799
If you don't want to get hurt,

28
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,556
just come with us.

29
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,531
Let's go.

30
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,582
Left.

31
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,796
Warriors,

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,836
are you working for Liu or...

33
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,035
How dare a merchant threaten an official?

34
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,236
You should know this day will come.

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,445
I see. It's Magistrate Du.

36
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,676
Tell me! Where did you
hide the thing you stole?

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,796
I don't mind telling you

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,516
but if I tell you now,

39
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,276
you still can't verify my words.

40
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,836
Why don't you let me
take you there instead?

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,796
Don't try to play tricks.

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,516
You said it yourself.

43
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,475
If you dare lie to me,

44
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,915
you'll have a hole in your body.

45
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,676
If I tell you now,

46
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,515
I'll die sooner.

47
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,091
Warriors,

48
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,156
how much did Magistrate Du pay you?

49
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,036
I can double your pay.

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,635
There are rules in our line of work.

51
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,156
There's no need to persuade us, Madam He.

52
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,476
Tell us immediately
and you will suffer less.

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,996
Don't you do this for money though?

54
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,716
If you take my money

55
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,640
and lie to Magistrate Du

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,236
by claiming that I no longer exist,

57
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,156
I won't appear again from now on.

58
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,972
- What do you think?   - Boss.

59
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,241
Master doesn't know how to
verify a body, why don't we...

60
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,356
We can't break the rules!

61
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,181
After her!

62
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,457
Open the door!

63
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,238
- Over there!   - Open the door!

64
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,229
Open the door!

65
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,422
Open the door!

66
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,086
Open the door!

67
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,996
We've finally been reunited

68
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,679
but the first thing you do

69
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,356
is actually kill your husband.

70
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,796
How cruel.

71
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,275
A long time has passed

72
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,116
and you've become so capable.

73
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,356
Did you learn from Chuan Yu?

74
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,596
Jiang Chang Yang.

75
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,996
You are alive.

76
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,796
I'm not dreaming.

77
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,131
Yes.

78
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,519
I am alive.

79
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:11,770
Come on.

80
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,675
Let's go home.

81
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,155
You were pierced by a sword.

82
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,716
What happened after that?

83
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,155
How did you survive?

84
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,116
That day, King Ning

85
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,596
purposely missed by an inch.

86
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,875
King Ning purposely kept you alive?

87
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,395
He wanted to know how many spies

88
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,996
His Majesty and I have planted

89
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,196
and how many secrets we have.

90
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,395
I passed out for a long time.

91
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
When I woke up,

92
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,515
King Ning treated me
well with food and wine.

93
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,596
He promised to release me

94
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,035
as long as I requested it.

95
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I knew

96
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,035
I had to recover well

97
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,675
to have a future

98
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,716
so I pretended to work with him.

99
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,675
I told him

100
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,478
I had a shadow guard unit that
could travel a great distance in a day.

101
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,996
I'm the only one

102
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,675
who knows about their hideout.

103
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,718
You did not lie to him.

104
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,538
Messenger pigeons can travel
a great distance in a day indeed.

105
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,970
The red-legged pigeons
were my summoning signal.

106
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:30,733
Messenger pigeons.

107
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,497
It didn't matter where the shadow
guards were located in the city,

108
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,236
they could see the signal
as long as they looked up.

109
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,196
If San Lang saw them,

110
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,836
he would also know

111
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,476
that I was still alive.

112
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,555
You fooled King Ning.

113
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,316
How could he endure that?

114
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,755
Did they punish you?

115
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,614
Ci.

116
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,389
They gave me a few punches.

117
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,918
I have a strong body so it's fine.

118
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:15,716
A few days later,

119
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,795
San Lang found an excuse to
summon King Ning into the palace.

120
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,595
Madam Yun and the rest sneaked in at night

121
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,236
and rescued me when the place was empty.

122
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,635
After I gathered my men,

123
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,996
I headed to Hedong immediately.

124
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,640
When I found out you
weren't at the Xiao residence

125
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,915
and went to find Aunt instead,

126
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,920
I rushed on

127
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,035
to meet you here.

128
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,316
Were you badly hurt?

129
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,033
Not at all.

130
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,076
Your chest was punctured

131
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,996
and you almost died.

132
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:02,395
Later, you were beaten up and interrogated.

133
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,915
If it wasn't bad,

134
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,836
you must be anxious after you escaped.

135
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Rushing to Hedong

136
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,675
would only take more than ten days.

137
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,275
However, you only come here at this time.

138
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,228
I can't hide anything

139
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,675
from Madam He.

140
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,956
Show me your wound.

141
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:30,400
We've not met for a long time

142
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,206
and the first thing you do
is to remove my clothes.

143
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,409
That's not right.

144
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,485
Listen to me. Show me

145
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,675
so I can be relieved.

146
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,229
It's all in the past

147
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
and no longer hurts.

148
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,975
Back then,

149
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,836
I was thinking about you.

150
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,076
When I figured that we
would one day meet again,

151
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,436
it was no longer tough for me.

152
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,404
On the other hand,

153
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,155
you watched me die.

154
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,356
I'm sure you were very sad

155
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,035
during that time.

156
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,836
The past is no longer important.

157
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,076
What's important is the future.

158
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:17,932
In the future,

159
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,476
let's not separate again.

160
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,438
Jiang Chang Yang,

161
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,596
don't worry.

162
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,635
I will protect you.

163
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:39,213
Now, I have

164
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,596
no money

165
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,236
and am leading a group of shadow guards.

166
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,042
In the future,

167
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,596
I have to rely on my wife.

168
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,035
The moon of the people is in the sky

169
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,956
but my moon

170
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,716
is by my side.

171
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,716
I'm so lucky.

172
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,716
King Ning sent his men
to capture us in secret.

173
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,156
In order not to let him
find out I'm in Hedong,

174
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,075
I asked my subordinates to split up.

175
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,987
There's an impostor of me in every unit

176
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:38,070
and they will each go to the land of
a governor who is close to King Ning.

177
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,515
Are you trying to confuse King Ning

178
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,943
and let him doubt his allies?

179
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,201
That's one of the reasons.

180
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,835
I've found many dark secrets

181
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,835
about various governors over the years.

182
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,345
They are all close to
King Ning and not you.

183
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,716
Father and I are not
afraid of being investigated.

184
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,082
The evidence is enough to let
Shuofang and Fanyang fight each other.

185
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,236
When there's discord between them,

186
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,035
they'll have no time to mobilize
their troops to help King Ning.

187
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,115
No wonder Father always praises you.

188
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,622
Sui Zhi, you are sly and have
many tricks up your sleeves indeed.

189
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,075
General, you should read other books

190
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,956
apart from military stratagems.

191
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,916
General, Shopowner Feng requests a meeting.

192
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,349
- Let him in.   - Yes.

193
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,856
General Yu.

194
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:29,915
The stocks have been counted
and stored in the warehouse.

195
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,040
The winter is getting colder.

196
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,405
If you need anything else,

197
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:33,729
please tell me as soon as possible.

198
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:34,920
I can still make another trip

199
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,355
before the river freezes.

200
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:38,683
When Sui Zhi escaped that day,

201
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
he sent someone to make records

202
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,315
of the inventory in King Ning's armory.

203
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,120
I drafted a list according to
King Ning's military strength.

204
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,956
There are some rare items on the list.

205
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,636
I'll have to trouble you.

206
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,476
Don't worry, General. I
will find everything for you.

207
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,481
Young Master, it's time to eat.

208
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,476
We've been reunited for a few days.

209
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,227
Why are you still looking at me like that?

210
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,636
When I competed with She Yan back then,

211
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,795
we were tied all the time.

212
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,996
In our last competition,

213
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,315
he fought for your life

214
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,476
but I failed to protect Madam He.

215
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,115
Please punish me.

216
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:56,636
Stand up.

217
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,876
Every life is equal.

218
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,839
I've never hoped for any one
of you to pay with your lives

219
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,716
if you fail to save someone.

220
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,996
Stand up.

221
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,320
You are my future brother-in-law

222
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,876
and Jiang Chang Yang's brother-in-law.

223
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,221
You must not act like a stranger.

224
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,583
Come. Sit down.

225
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,196
Mu Dan is right.

226
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,075
I heard you haven't married Da Fu

227
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,156
because of my death.

228
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,835
When everything is over,

229
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,515
I want you to rush back to Chang'an

230
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,693
and get Madam Sun's
approval for your proposal.

231
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,396
It's too cold. I'll warm
them up at night for you.

232
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:54,125
As for this,

233
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,925
break it and use it as firewood.

234
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,583
Let's go.

235
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:01,539
Don't try to talk your way out.

236
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,953
The name you gave me is so bad.

237
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Do you know?

238
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:12,396
You said the same thing to me

239
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,956
in my dream.

240
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,996
Do I appear in your dreams often?

241
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,156
What else did I say in your dreams?

242
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,840
You were also acting like a rascal

243
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,956
in my dreams.

244
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,560
You kept saying things
I didn't like to hear

245
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,716
and making me angry.

246
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,612
Where are they?

247
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:54,978
Madam.

248
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,723
Chuan Yu is making a
delivery at the warehouse.

249
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,075
I didn't see the shopowner.

250
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,479
When she came back,

251
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,795
Madam Feng cried.

252
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,486
Then, she went back to her
study and never came out.

253
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,822
Thank you.

254
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,115
She probably went to Hedong

255
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,716
and remembers something sad.

256
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:16,828
Let's go.

257
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,275
Every time I dream of you,

258
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,196
you'd tell me to forget about you.

259
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,956
I said

260
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,555
I could forget you

261
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,595
as long as you take my heart out

262
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,139
because

263
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:40,075
you are already in my heart.

264
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,156
I can only forget about you

265
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,676
if my heart is removed.

266
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,236
Every time I woke up,

267
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,035
I thought it was your soul
that went into my dreams.

268
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,275
Otherwise, you will never be

269
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,591
as stubborn inside the dream

270
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,671
as you are out here.

271
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,028
Mu Dan.

272
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,119
Didn't Da Fu and Xiao Chun

273
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,636
talk to you in the last few months?

274
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,600
Jiang Chang Yang, are
you saying that I talk a lot?

275
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,755
I dare not.

276
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,396
When I passed out,

277
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,396
I also got rid of my boredom

278
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,716
by speaking to you in my dream.

279
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,315
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang.

280
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,996
I still have questions to ask you.

281
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,115
Why did you lie to me about the jade comb?

282
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,996
Aunt told me everything.

283
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,396
She didn't give it to you.

284
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,075
I know everything.

285
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:48,941
Mu Dan.

286
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:55,852
Da Fu. Xiao Chun. Don't be afraid.

287
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,396
I can't explain this to you

288
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,960
in a short time.

289
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,236
Anyway,

290
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,355
Jiang Chang Yang isn't dead.

291
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:03,676
He's back.

292
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,513
I have a shadow. I'm alive.

293
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,436
You're not dead.

294
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,275
You're still alive!

295
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,850
That's great!

296
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,595
Does Chuan Yu know?

297
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,355
If Chuan Yu sees you,

298
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,679
he'll be so happy.

299
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,916
He knows. He has been
feeling happy all the way.

300
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,401
However, Lord Jiang doesn't look too well.

301
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,144
Are you not fully recovered yet?

302
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:29,279
Come.

303
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,742
There's no need. I'm
just tired from the journey.

304
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,152
That's right, Jiang Chang Yang.

305
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,075
You've been hiding your injuries from me.

306
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,679
Da Fu, catch him.

307
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,253
Xiao Chun, take his pulse.

308
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,822
Da... Da Fu.

309
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,509
- You, come here.   - I'll help you out.

310
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:43,895
Chuan Yu, you...

311
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,519
Hold your young master down.

312
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,515
- Chuan Yu.   - He's alive!

313
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,716
The Dongqing Festival is coming soon.

314
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,590
Everyone is busy with training in the army.

315
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,956
I've decided not to hold it for a year.

316
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,245
When the threat has been eliminated,

317
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,596
we'll hold the festival again.

318
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,716
The initial intention of
the Dongqing Festival

319
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,075
is to reward the Hedong Army
for fighting bravely in battles

320
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,555
and protecting the border.

321
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,315
Right now, it hasn't been a year
since the old general passed away.

322
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:17,035
We should organize a huge
festival to remember him.

323
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,555
My father never cared
about fame after his death.

324
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,555
He only wants prosperity and
peace for the people of Hedong.

325
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,853
The people don't know the
dangers of the imperial court.

326
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,059
The old general had the people's support.

327
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,413
If the Dongqing Festival
isn't carried out, I'm afraid

328
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
people might be doubtful.

329
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:39,730
Moreover,

330
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,396
when the Hedong army
is sent back to the fief,

331
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,636
King Ning sent his spies along.

332
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,956
They are still hidden in the city.

333
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:49,156
If Hedong has any strange movements,

334
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,476
King Ning will be suspicious.

335
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,676
You are right.

336
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,257
Organize the Dongqing Festival as usual.

337
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,156
Come inside. Are you doing well today?

338
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,515
Not bad.

339
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,315
Everyone,

340
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:46,493
I wish all of you

341
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,315
a blessing in the Dongqing Festival today.

342
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,835
Let's drink together.

343
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,115
All right!

344
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,772
- Put it here.   - Min, eat.

345
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,198
(Dongqing Festival)

346
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,280
Madam Yun sent a letter and said
everyone in Chang'an is doing well.

347
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,716
Li Xing has changed as well.

348
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,355
He knows his limits in the imperial court

349
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,505
and no longer takes the
people of King Ning head-on.

350
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,519
Thankfully, he was knocked out.

351
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,436
Otherwise, he would be killed as well.

352
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:35,978
Jiang Chang Yang.

353
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,956
Don't you think

354
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:42,462
there are more lanterns in
the city and they are brighter?

355
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:45,905
On the day of the Dongqing Festival,

356
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,755
the people will light all
the lanterns in their houses.

357
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,196
The lanterns will be lit until the morning.

358
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,755
This is how they remember

359
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,156
the Hedong soldiers who
sacrificed on the battlefield.

360
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,239
I wonder how long

361
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,156
this peaceful life will go on.

362
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,396
If a war cannot be avoided,

363
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,996
I hope the people won't get involved.

364
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,795
The Hedong army is strong

365
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,636
and the soldiers and people

366
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,999
work together.

367
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,636
We have the advantage
in terrain and teamwork.

368
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,115
King Ning's ambition won't be fulfilled.

369
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,275
We can worry about the future later.

370
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,572
Let's enjoy this wonderful
moment tonight. Let's go.

371
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,893
Don't be afraid. Come here.

372
00:29:51,102 --> 00:29:52,338
Buy a sugar drawing.

373
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,788
- Sugar drawing?   - Do you want one?

374
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,242
Give me one.

375
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,196
Please make
one with both of us.

376
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,540
It's fine.

377
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,956
The mask is so heavy.

378
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,693
Look. It's done.

379
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,052
- For you.   - Thank you.

380
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,260
Thank you.

381
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,013
- Take care.   - Let's go.

382
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,355
There's no one here. I can remove my mask.

383
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,355
Close your doors and windows!

384
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,156
Beware of fire and thieves!

385
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,996
Close your doors and windows!

386
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,876
Beware of fire and thieves!

387
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,555
I want to keep walking with you forever.

388
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,355
Unfortunately, there's a curfew.

389
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,799
With this,

390
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,314
we won't be affected.

391
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,444
However, you need to
return to Jizhou tomorrow.

392
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:13,965
Won't you feel too tired

393
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:15,636
if you don't sleep the whole night?

394
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,038
It's rare to have an opportunity like this.

395
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:21,662
Moreover, I can take a nap in the
carriage because of the long journey.

396
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,755
Walking together on a silent night.

397
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,075
Watching the moon and the lanterns.

398
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,436
How fun.

399
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,876
Jiang Chang Yang

400
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,636
still went to Hedong.

401
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,275
Shuofang

402
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,835
and Fanyang's discord

403
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,396
was caused by him as well.

404
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,436
It seems like he and Yu Zheng

405
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,959
are going against me

406
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,636
even if it takes their lives.

407
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,355
Hedong's military strength

408
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:23,766
must not be underestimated.

409
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,956
You must make a decision early, My Lord.

410
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,814
Fanyang

411
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,876
and Shuofang

412
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,035
might be close to Hedong

413
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,555
but its army isn't as great as Hexi's.

414
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,825
It's time to use the Xiao family.

415
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:47,820
I'm afraid we don't have
a high chance of winning

416
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,705
if Hexi is the only place
that mobilizes its troops.

417
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,636
Jiannan might be far

418
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,075
but its governor is
pledging his loyalty to you.

419
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,900
Why not give him a chance to contribute?

420
00:33:58,598 --> 00:33:59,656
All right.

421
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,716
Send a message to not wait any longer.

422
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,716
It's time

423
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,716
to make the final move.

424
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,126
Yes.

425
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,356
Emergency military report from Hedong!

426
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,280
The Hedong Army is starting a rebellion

427
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,476
and must be executed.

428
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,366
Your Majesty, please make a
decision as soon as possible.

429
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:34,879
Your Majesty,

430
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,436
I'm willing to lead the army to battle.

431
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,155
I will never return

432
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,595
before eliminating the traitors.

433
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,715
I am willing to follow His
Lordship to the battlefield.

434
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:47,666
Please approve my request, Your Majesty.

435
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,356
Brother, you are an
example to all the officials

436
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,916
by volunteering.

437
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,566
I will wait for your triumphant return

438
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,635
in Chang'an.

439
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,635
I will never let Your Majesty down.

440
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,705
These shields are fireproof.

441
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:22,959
There are more than 4,000 of them.

442
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,661
They are enough to defend against
King Ning's 50 barrels of flammable oil.

443
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:30,859
General, look.

444
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,320
This bow is made from mulberry wood.

445
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,276
The string is made from silk produced
by silkworms eating mulberry leaves.

446
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,356
Every string is made
from 20 threads of silk.

447
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,115
What else can't you find?

448
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,756
The Hedong army is fortunate

449
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
to receive your help.

450
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,077
You're too polite, general.

451
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,956
Hedong rains a lot in spring.

452
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,624
The bows don't store well in humid places.

453
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,062
When you store it, please
dry it with a charcoal fire.

454
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:56,853
All right.

455
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,047
King Ning has mobilized his troops.

456
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,555
You must be careful on the battlefield.

457
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,051
Don't worry. I will protect myself.

458
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:20,398
That's only for close-quarter combat.

459
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,075
You might be good at
fighting but don't push yourself.

460
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:28,284
Wait for me to come back.

461
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:30,796
We'll get married when I return.

462
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,756
If we don't return,

463
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,445
bring Aunt to Xinluo by boat immediately.

464
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,043
Knock on wood.

465
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,115
Don't say something so inauspicious.

466
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,235
Mu Dan gave me this armor. It's very tough.

467
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,115
Don't hurt your hand, Aunt.

468
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,489
Stop joking.

469
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,436
Don't you dare die again.

470
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:57,897
I understand.

471
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,595
You are greedy about all things

472
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:09,316
but you're not afraid of dying.

473
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:11,315
Now that you have me,

474
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,956
you should be acting like a coward.

475
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,973
Only Mu Dan knows me best.

476
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,024
I'm leaving.

477
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,316
Hedong's Governor, Yu Zheng!

478
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,715
Hedong's Governor, Yu Zheng!

479
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,515
You start a rebellion

480
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,595
and are unworthy of becoming an official!

481
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,479
You start a rebellion

482
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,316
and are unworthy of becoming an official!

483
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,496
According to

484
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,115
the imperial court's orders!

485
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,360
According to the imperial court's orders!

486
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,876
I'm leading the Zhongyang Army,

487
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,836
Hexi Army,

488
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,675
and Jiannan Army

489
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,396
to quell the rebellion!

490
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,715
Quell the rebellion!

491
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:39,137
Surrender immediately without resistance!

492
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:42,677
Surrender immediately without resistance!

493
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,595
Look who's talking, Traitor!

494
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,515
Look who's talking, Traitor!

495
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,115
The Hedong Army has defended
the border for many years!

496
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,675
The Hedong Army has defended
the border for many years!

497
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,836
We are loyal to the emperor and the empire!

498
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,715
We are loyal to the emperor and the empire!

499
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,436
We have never had any
intention to start a rebellion!

500
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,796
We have never had any
intention to start a rebellion!

501
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,836
Today, we will sacrifice
ourselves for the empire!

502
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,555
Today, we will sacrifice
ourselves for the empire!

503
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:13,131
Instead of bowing down to a traitor!

504
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,595
Instead of bowing down to a traitor!

505
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:20,861
Fine.

506
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,436
Attack!

507
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,035
Fire!

508
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,715
Defend!
