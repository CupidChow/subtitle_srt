1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,974
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:40,840
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:43,623
Minister Zhang has five mistresses.

4
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,153
He kept all of the accounts and dirty money

5
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,942
in the residence of the
mistress he liked the least.

6
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,197
What a complicated game this is.

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,120
To think that you're patient
enough to plan your moves.

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,240
When it comes to the privacy
and dirty deeds of corrupt officials,

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,383
there's nothing that
Sui Zhi cannot uncover.

10
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,680
All just cheap tricks and
petty schemes, really.

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,702
Though we've gathered all the
evidence of King Ning's crimes,

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,946
but with his allies being
removed one after another,

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,943
no matter how flawless our plans,

14
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,983
surely he has grown suspicious.

15
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,862
King Ning's power is waning.

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,862
His faction sees it too.

17
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,343
Their loyalty already wavers.

18
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,840
And now, with his failure to
sway the imperial exam results,

19
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,063
the aristocrats are no
longer easy to please.

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,623
He's spread too thin to manage it all.

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,063
King Ning can't afford to lose
the support of the noble families.

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,702
Even if he wishes to investigate us,

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,183
he'll first have to pacify his allies.

24
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,329
When he makes his move,

25
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,479
our opportunity will come.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,822
General Yu has sent word.

27
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,599
In seven days,

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
the Hedong army

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,063
will be at the city gates.

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,446
This Shaowei Banquet is meant for officials

31
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,383
to express gratitude
for His Majesty's favor.

32
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,783
Since you're hosting, holding
it at Fang Garden is only fitting.

33
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,913
When the plan is set in motion,

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
blades will be drawn.

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,072
King Ning may have lost
the Ministry of War's support,

36
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:39,696
but the Imperial Guards
still answer to Pei Zhong.

37
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,223
That's exactly why General Yu came here,

38
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,783
to keep Pei Zhong's men in check.

39
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,396
Fang Garden is our own estate,

40
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,543
and you know every inch of its layout.

41
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,269
If anything happens,

42
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,503
it'll be much easier
for you to act quickly.

43
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,743
Then everyone in Fang Garden
must be relocated beforehand.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't worry.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,902
I'll have Madam Tang and the others
leave three days before the banquet.

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,506
Xiao Chun and Da Fu
won't be so easy to fool,

47
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,866
but I'll arrange a delivery job for them.

48
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,919
I'll send them out of the
city, That'll keep them safe.

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Mu Dan.

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Jiang Chang Yang,

51
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,629
when the time comes
to bring down King Ning,

52
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,023
I have to be at your side.

53
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,520
I was never going to ask you to leave.

54
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,313
We promised each other, didn't we?

55
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
We'd

56
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,199
never be parted.

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,023
Your mother finally received
the lantern I offered her.

58
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,960
Mother already knew your name.

59
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,543
The flame burned so brightly just now.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,533
It must mean she's very pleased with you.

61
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Of course she is.

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,266
Where else could she find such
a brilliant and dashing son-in-law?

63
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,439
There you go again.

64
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,506
- Please forgive us.   - It's fine.

65
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,277
You've accidentally knocked
down these fortune sticks.

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,422
Perhaps it's fate.

67
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,862
Would you like your fortunes read?

68
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Sure.

69
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
(Best Luck)

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
(Worst Luck)

71
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,624
You can have my Best Luck stick.

72
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Here.

73
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,795
We're one as husband and wife.

74
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,742
We should share the same fortune.

75
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,073
Just interpret this one, please.

76
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,908
Should we tie one too?

77
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,303
Make our bond even tighter,

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,423
so tight it lasts through lifetimes.

79
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,903
I already made my wish
when I lit the lantern.

80
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,742
We're fated to be together life after life.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,822
No need to waste money on this.

82
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,502
There's no one in the
world stingier than you.

83
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,622
You won't even spend on this?

84
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Fine, have it your way.

85
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Look.

86
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,622
How strange that Madam
He, who does so much good,

87
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,783
has such poor judgment in men!

88
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,783
She wouldn't leave that
shameless scoundrel even now.

89
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,182
Maybe she can't escape.

90
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,236
She's a merchant, clearly
knows how to make money.

91
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,622
I'd wager it's him who won't let her go.

92
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Fair point.

93
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,023
You're both mistaken.

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,862
It's not that he won't let me go,

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,742
I'm the one clinging to him.

96
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,839
She...

97
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,313
My wife is wise and
discerning in all things,

98
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
perfect in every way.

99
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,743
Except her weakness for handsome men.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,103
She won't leave me

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,023
simply because she's
obsessed with my looks.

102
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,053
Indeed, my husband is
wonderful in every way.

103
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,463
His good looks are just the least of it.

104
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,742
May you both find a man
just as perfect someday.

105
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,960
Again? Just drink!

106
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,077
No way you can win everytime!

107
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,973
I don't believe it.

108
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,400
Another round!
Watch, everyone!

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,703
Ready! One, two, three, go!

110
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,223
Come on!

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,182
Come on!

112
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,320
- Guess!   - I want to play too.

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,502
You can join later.

114
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
This one.

115
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,400
I can't believe it! How did
you get it right everytime?

116
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,879
- You're good!   - Pour me a drink.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Ouch!

118
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,160
Well, well, Chuan Yu,
you were letting her win!

119
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,864
You shouldn't have done that!

120
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,424
This is your fault for meddling!

121
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,799
Just eat your flatbread!

122
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,117
You two look like real brothers.

123
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
If you dueled, who would win?

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,662
- Obviously me.   - Me.

125
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,382
- Bet on him!   - She Yan! She Yan!

126
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,809
We bet She Yin will win!

127
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,920
You don't know that!

128
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,559
Here comes the fruit.

129
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,360
Come on.

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Let's do it then.

131
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
It's starting! Come on, guys, let's watch!

132
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,759
It's starting.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,063
Get him!

134
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,676
She Yan! She Yan!

135
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,146
Oh no, we bet
on the wrong guy.

136
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:30,022
Come on, She Yan!

137
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,279
- She Yan!   - Chuan Yu, you can do it!

138
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Hold your ground, Chuan Yu!
Put your back into it, tackle him!

139
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,823
Watch out for a sneak attack!

140
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,596
Yes!

141
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,223
Well done, She Yan!

142
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,039
Come on.

143
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,553
You are going out of the
city tomorrow for the delivery,

144
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,986
so let me remind you of a few things.

145
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,589
Da Fu, remember,

146
00:10:19,472 --> 00:10:21,095
you must control your temper.

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,246
No more threatening people with
'a good old beating', understand?

148
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:25,733
I know.

149
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,879
And Xiao Chun,

150
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,223
you have to watch your sharp tongue.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,862
Anyway, just be extra
careful while you're out there.

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Keep yourselves safe.

153
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,133
Don't worry, Mu Dan.
We'll look out for each other.

154
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,063
Yes, it's not like it's our first time out.

155
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,900
You're acting like this
is some final farewell.

156
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,022
We'll be back in a couple of days.

157
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,463
Yes, yes, I know, I'm
just worried about you.

158
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,262
I'll make something nice
for you when you get back.

159
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,362
- Go on now.   - We're going then.

160
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,602
Stay safe!

161
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,279
Don't worry.

162
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,463
You'll see them again soon.

163
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,662
For years,

164
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,542
I had only Chuan Yu
and She Yan for company.

165
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,983
But after meeting you,

166
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,943
not only did my home grow warmer,

167
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,520
I gained more family and friends.

168
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,142
When I was trapped in the Liu Residence,

169
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,862
I never imagined

170
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,502
I'd find such happiness too.

171
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,142
You've done so much for me,

172
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,902
given me so much.

173
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,123
I won't lose them.

174
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,542
The annular boxes.

175
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,303
These are our hair locks.

176
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,902
Since it's our love token,

177
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,142
then something else must be added.

178
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,823
It's that copper coin.

179
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,423
You actually kept it.

180
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,757
You were the first person

181
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,622
who dared try negotiating
with Flower Bird Envoy

182
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:33,902
with just a copper coin.

183
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,183
That's when I knew,

184
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,022
anything you set your mind to,

185
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,142
you'd find a way to make it happen.

186
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,290
Don't tell me

187
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,343
you started falling for me since then?

188
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,120
Who can say exactly when it began?

189
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,279
But that night,

190
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:55,066
when you stood there, covered in wounds,

191
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,823
your eyes were burning
with defiance and strength.

192
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
I knew it then.

193
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,799
I'd never forget

194
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,823
those eyes for as long as I lived.

195
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
This is mine now.

196
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,633
A lifetime may last a hundred years,

197
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,983
but what we carry with us

198
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,022
are fleeting moments, one after another.

199
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:40,022
Every moment I've shared with you

200
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,679
is right here.

201
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,303
Whatever tomorrow brings,

202
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,703
I have no more regrets.

203
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,279
Mu Dan.

204
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Are you afraid?

205
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,639
No.

206
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,983
I'm just filled with so many regrets.

207
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,583
There are so many scenery

208
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,943
we haven't admired together.

209
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,382
So many delicacies

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,463
we haven't tasted together.

211
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,759
Jiang Chang Yang,

212
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,862
no matter what happens tomorrow,

213
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,022
please keep yourself safe.

214
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Remember,

215
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,463
I'll be waiting for you.

216
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
(Fang Garden)

217
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,022
After enduring endless
suspicion and persecution,

218
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,753
Cao Zhi composed the Nine Sorrows Rhapsody,

219
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,153
a masterpiece blending
elegance with grievance.

220
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,359
Cao Zhi's rhapsody,

221
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,839
so richly worded, so brilliantly crafted,

222
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,342
it holds an unshakable moral spine.

223
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,863
Banished for loyal counsel,

224
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,143
yet true to his sovereign.

225
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,223
The vulgar world knows no constancy,

226
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,383
how can slander and
praise hold equal weight?

227
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,623
Blinded by selfish pursuits,

228
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,663
they harm those who serve the public good.

229
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,863
Clustering in factions,
they envy the worthy,

230
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,782
cast me adrift down the great Yangtze.

231
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,996
Alas! How fortune's wheel has turned,

232
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,143
bitter this fate ordained for me.

233
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,742
Sorrow upon sorrow weighs my heart,

234
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,262
constant anguish grips my soul.

235
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,703
Years pass as I wait in vain,

236
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,263
as you, my sovereign,
grow ever more distant.

237
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,822
You ride the soaring dragon's winding path,

238
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,542
beneath fluttering banners
of emerald and rainbow.

239
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,022
You tread the upright
path of ancient emperors,

240
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,342
why would you stray into
crooked, corrupt paths?

241
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,639
Knowing my offense invites blame,

242
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,040
I scorn to fawn for favor.

243
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,022
You're just newly minted scholars.

244
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,022
Yet you recited such gloomy,
ominous verses at a celebratory banquet.

245
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,742
How utterly reckless and out of line!

246
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,983
It's merely an ancient poet's work.

247
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,359
How... How can this be?

248
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,663
Are you really frightened

249
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,062
by a classical poem, Commander Pei?

250
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Teacher?

251
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,877
Dean Xu.

252
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,519
You're still alive!

253
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Do you remember

254
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,680
which of Cao Zhi's poems was my favourite?

255
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,383
I cast aside concern for my life

256
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,502
as if throwing myself upon the blade.

257
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,903
If I can forsake even my parents,

258
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,822
how could I cling to wife or child?

259
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,223
My name is written among the brave,

260
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,780
there is no room for selfish thought.

261
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,742
To lay down my life for the nation's peril,

262
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,270
I face death as if returning home.

263
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Well recited!

264
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,599
Your Majesty.

265
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
King Ning,

266
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,623
it's been a long time.

267
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Your Highness,

268
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,342
Taoguang Courtyard has prepared
women's garments these past two days

269
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,143
They've even prepared wine

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,703
and bathing supplies for tonight.

271
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,262
They're for He Wei Fang?

272
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Yes.

273
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,223
Zi Shu must've lost his mind.

274
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,633
Even if Jiang Chang Yang lets her go,

275
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,542
He Wei Fang would never agree to it.

276
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,143
Jiang Chang Yang may still
hold the title of Flower Bird Envoy,

277
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,022
but his influence is no longer what it was.

278
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,062
What if He Wei Fang decides to
aim for higher power and status?

279
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,383
Don't let her words
fool you, Your Highness.

280
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,131
Prepare my carriage.

281
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:16,040
Yes, Your Highness.

282
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,782
I awaited General Yu's arrival,

283
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,022
only to be greeted by a
resurrected acquaintance.

284
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,542
Allow me to toast your
miraculous return from death.

285
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,519
Dean Xu,

286
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,839
my apologies.

287
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
I just poured

288
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,863
that wine out a moment ago.

289
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,383
Teacher, what is going on?

290
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,062
King Ning sent men to assassinate me.

291
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,223
I had no choice but to fake my death.

292
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,262
Sui Zhi saved my life.

293
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,223
That's why I could stand before you today.

294
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,863
Sui Zhi.

295
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,316
So you've been acting all along.

296
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,663
For today's performance,

297
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,183
we've been setting the stage
for years just for you, My Lord.

298
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,822
I hope it meets your expectations.

299
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Your Majesty!

300
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,822
Your Majesty, King Ning has seized
control of the Ministry of Revenue.

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,317
He has been smuggling
goods, embezzling state funds,

302
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,125
undermining our nation's
foundation! The evidence is here.

303
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,920
Please review it, Your Majesty!

304
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Your Majesty!

305
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,436
King Ning has formed
factions for personal gain,

306
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,357
colluded with noble
clans to sell official posts,

307
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,357
pocketed taxes, and seized
farmland from the people,

308
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,236
forcing countless
civilians from their homes,

309
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,742
leaving them destitute.

310
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Your Majesty!

311
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,357
King Ning has manufactured weapons,

312
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,516
set up secret arms factories,

313
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,557
raised assassins to
eliminate loyal officials.

314
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:07,740
He even annihilated
Minister Lu and his family!

315
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,703
For his insatiable greed,

316
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,093
King Ning turned a blind
eye to the suffering of millions.

317
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,582
To feed his lust for power,

318
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,943
he slaughtered colleagues
and defied all moral order.

319
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,502
He spied on His Majesty's private affairs,

320
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,623
manipulated the court,
and endangered the nation.

321
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,423
The great fire in Mengzhou years ago

322
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,613
was plotted by him to
assassinate His Majesty.

323
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,383
Every crime he committed violated
the laws, each act unforgivable!

324
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,423
Such a traitorous, unrighteous man

325
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,400
must be stripped of rank and titles,

326
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,863
imprisoned and executed.

327
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,022
Only then can justice be done

328
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,300
for His Majesty, and for all people!

329
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
So it seems

330
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:06,302
you're the one who orchestrated
this trap for me, Your Majesty.

331
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,703
Now that things have come to this,

332
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,022
isn't it time you said something?

333
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,262
Your crimes have reached heaven's limit.

334
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,903
Heaven itself decrees your punishment.

335
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,383
Brother, do you plead guilty?

336
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,637
You've held back all these years,

337
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,542
waiting for this moment, haven't you?

338
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,423
But these people

339
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,983
are either weak in standing

340
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,502
or still wet behind the ears.

341
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,943
Surely you don't believe

342
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,996
that their hollow accusations alone

343
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,022
can topple me?

344
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,102
By imperial order,

345
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
seize the traitor,

346
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
purge the disloyal!

347
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,196
You're not going anywhere!
You are part of his faction too.

348
00:26:08,312 --> 00:26:09,312
Sit down!

349
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
King Ning,

350
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,423
do you admit your guilt?

351
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,022
What if I do?

352
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,039
And what if

353
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,183
I don't?

354
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,742
General Yu's son, Yu Zheng,

355
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,758
is stationed with the Hedong army
just outside the walls of Chang'an,

356
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,102
awaiting the signal to move.

357
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,903
As for General Yu Chang himself,

358
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,359
by now, he should be at your residence,

359
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,422
to execute the confiscation edict.

360
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,383
My Lord, you have one incense stick's time.

361
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,703
If you kneel and confess now,

362
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,742
His Majesty may spare your family,
no punishment beyond this generation.

363
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,782
But if you remain obstinate,

364
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,863
by the time the incense burns out,

365
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,863
the Hedong army will march
in with ironclad evidence.

366
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
When that happens,

367
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:18,022
your loyalists will be
executed on the spot,

368
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,943
without clemency.

369
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,623
The ones whose time is running out,

370
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,302
the ones who remain obstinate,

371
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,143
are all of you, not me!

372
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,582
It's his private troop.

373
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,663
Chuan Yu, go and get Mu Dan away from here!

374
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,520
- Young Master!   - Keep her safe!

375
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Go!

376
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,542
Protect Dean Xu!

377
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Watch out!

378
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,463
Come on, Teacher! I'll get you out of here!

379
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Come on!

380
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,463
Those who know which way the
wind blows and pledge allegiance now,

381
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,903
I will grant you full pardon.

382
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:56,863
But for those who obstinately resist,

383
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
show no mercy

384
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
and kill them all!

385
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,077
Don't kill me!

386
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,317
I serve King Ning!

387
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,476
I swear allegiance to King Ning!

388
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,062
I swear allegiance to King Ning!

389
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,183
Despicable dog!

390
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,319
Zhang Qian, get Dean Xu out of here!

391
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Sui Zhi,

392
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,262
please be careful!

393
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,559
Teacher!

394
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,279
Young Master!

395
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,720
Jiang Chang Yang, you've lost.

396
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,102
That fire at the Examination Hall

397
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,903
burned away His
Lordship's last trust in you.

398
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,143
To pin down the exact
day you'd make your move,

399
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,342
we got to Zhang Qian.

400
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,542
When there's a shortcut to the top,

401
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,102
no one bothers with the long road.

402
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,863
Those so-called loyal and
righteous men around His Majesty,

403
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,863
you think they don't have weaknesses?

404
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,183
The more sentimental and devoted they are,

405
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,742
the more they have people
they can't bear to lose.

406
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,183
That's where you lost,
you're not ruthless enough.

407
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,062
For King Ning to manage
to scheme this in days,

408
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,542
his rift with the noble clans

409
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,196
was just an act to fool us.

410
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,906
You spent all that time setting the stage,

411
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,782
only to be tricked by
His Lordship in the end.

412
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,273
Consider it a fair exchange.

413
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,302
There are no family members

414
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,342
left in my residence,

415
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,463
only servants

416
00:33:49,233 --> 00:33:51,216
and enough gunpowder to burn it all down.

417
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,903
Look at those flames.

418
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:01,143
Yu Chang and his elite soldiers
won't be returning to Hedong now.

419
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,799
Your Majesty,

420
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,839
Sui Zhi,

421
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,542
do you hear that?

422
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,743
Is that the sound of their screams

423
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,716
as they burn alive in the fire?

424
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,757
Who sent you? Where are you taking me?

425
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,917
At least tell me who sent you!

426
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,520
Our master doesn't want you to die here.

427
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,823
Is your master Liu Chang? Is it Liu Chang?

428
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,840
Please stop struggling. Just come with us.

429
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,663
This is all a misunderstanding then.

430
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,943
If it's Liu Chang, that's fine then.

431
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,773
I don't want to die here either.

432
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,383
I can walk myself.

433
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,303
Let go! Just let me go.
I said I'll walk myself!

434
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,582
You should've just told
me it was Liu Chang.

435
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,142
Though you betrayed me, Your Majesty,

436
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:30,506
you're still my brother.

437
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,863
To vanquish cruelty, one must
act with ultimate benevolence.

438
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,743
As for Jiang Chang Yang,

439
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,622
he consorted with deviants,
colluded with traitors,

440
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,702
deceived the throne, plotted
rebellion, and murdered fellow officials.

441
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,983
Your Majesty, how should we

442
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,222
dispose of such vermin?

443
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,383
I owe the imperial family a life.

444
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,983
It's a debt long overdue.

445
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,039
Sui Zhi...

446
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
San Lang.

447
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,622
Do you remember...

448
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,222
Your promise to me?

449
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,863
Precisely because we're like brothers,

450
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,463
you must be willing to sacrifice me.

451
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,860
If we ever face danger like that again,

452
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:30,903
you have to abandon me.

453
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,222
Jiang Chang Yang!

454
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,102
Jiang Chang Yang!

455
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,823
Jiang Chang Yang!

456
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,159
Jiang...

457
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,823
Jiang Chang Yang!

458
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,542
I'll be right here with you

459
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,542
as you watch Jiang Chang
Yang die before your eyes.

460
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Sui Zhi,

461
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,582
I can't do it.

462
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,743
I can't do it.

463
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,582
Flower Bird Envoy is hard to kill.

464
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,823
Make sure he's dead.

465
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Yes, My Lord.

466
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
He's gone.

467
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,222
Young Master!
