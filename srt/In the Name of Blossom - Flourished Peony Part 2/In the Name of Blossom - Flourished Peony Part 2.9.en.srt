1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,008
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,920
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,920
This is your best song.

4
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,400
How could you play it wrongly?

5
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,126
Have you gotten rusty or are you

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,880
troubled by something?

7
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,480
With all that noise,

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,503
it's hard to focus.

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,182
Rest assured.

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,662
Today, merriment comes first.

11
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,263
If anything in this residence
is damaged, I'll repay it twofold.

12
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,783
The objects matter little.

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,803
I'm just worried

14
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,302
it might frighten my deer.

15
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,296
Zi Shu knows his boundary.

16
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,702
He knows what can and can't be touched.

17
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Your Majesty.

18
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,503
Surely

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,383
you haven't gifted Sui
Zhi some rare treasure

20
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,063
even I know nothing about?

21
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,702
You flatter me, My Lord.

22
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,120
When has His Majesty ever
withheld treasures from you?

23
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,583
The downside of having a large estate

24
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,783
is that it takes forever to fetch a drink.

25
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,326
Sui Zhi, when the wine arrives,

26
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,463
you will drink three cups as penalty.

27
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,799
My Lord, since you went to
such lengths to find this wine,

29
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,343
I'll gladly drink you

30
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,182
under the table.

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,823
You can certainly hold your liquor.

32
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,983
You'd better not pretend
to be drunk to fool me.

33
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,079
Looks like

34
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,023
they have

35
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:37,248
found the wine.

36
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
Brother, you were just looking for wine.

37
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,583
Why did you smash his wall?

38
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,783
If we hadn't,

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,502
how would we have found out

40
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,840
that even those closest to us hide secrets?

41
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,800
- Zi Shu. - Yes, My Lord.

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,262
All men have their desires.

43
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,023
I do have parts of myself
I'd rather keep private.

44
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,062
My Lord, might I beg this
personal favor from you?

45
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
Sui Zhi, your nervousness suggests

46
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,862
this hidden chamber holds quite the secret.

47
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,544
You are after all His
Majesty's closest aid.

48
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,382
For His Majesty's safety,

49
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,302
I cannot grant your request.

50
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,399
Besides,

51
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,959
Your Majesty,

52
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,103
are you really not concerned about
what might be hidden down there?

53
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,839
Sui Zhi and I

54
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,663
grew up together.

55
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,942
We've shared meals and
traveled every path together.

56
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,663
If I can't trust even him,
then who can I trust?

57
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,463
Everyone has their secrets.

58
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,742
Must you expose them?

59
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,320
Your Majesty, you're understanding,

60
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,463
but I must fulfill my duty to protect you,

61
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,840
guarding against the
smallest threat before it grows.

62
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,680
- Zi Shu. - Yes, My Lord.

63
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Your Majesty,

64
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
after you.

65
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,240
(Secret Spring Night Erotica)

66
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,783
Well well, Sui Zhi,

67
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,319
you've been hiding quite
the pleasure den here!

68
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
Even my imperial harem pales
in comparison to your collection.

69
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,080
A man's private pleasures
and bedchamber secrets

70
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,526
were never meant for public eyes.

71
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,213
But since you and His Lordship command it,

72
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,552
I've no choice but to comply.

73
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,519
Now that you've seen
it, I trust you're satisfied?

74
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
As the ancients said,

75
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,583
food and sex are fundamental human desires.

76
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,862
Sui Zhi, there's no need to feel ashamed.

77
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,159
Zi Shu,

78
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:03,893
what have you found?

79
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,199
These are rare treasures
I've collected from all over.

80
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,719
If you are interested, I can
give you a couple of volumes.

81
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,066
I forgot about your leg.

82
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,655
I suppose trying them might be a challenge.

83
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,583
I'm not interested in nasty things!

84
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,022
Why are you getting worked up?

85
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,281
Could it be this sheer curtain reminds you

86
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,225
of your scandal at the
Liu Residence in Luoyang?

87
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,240
- You... - Sui Zhi!

88
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,016
I don't mean to disrespect you by
dredging up old matters, My Lord.

89
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,920
However, Liu Chang has gone too far.

90
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,263
First, the County Princess burned
down my concubine's garden.

91
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,320
Now Vice Envoy Liu is tearing down my home.

92
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,240
I built this secret chamber
behind Mu Dan's back.

93
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
And now she's going to find out.

94
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,262
Are you trying to make us
fight so you could swoop in?

95
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,983
My Lord, I swear I had no such intentions.

96
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,080
You said that,

97
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,662
but look at what you've done.

98
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,200
My Lord, if you're going to defend him...

99
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,192
Please stand up for me, Your Majesty.

100
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,262
Liu Chang went too far this time.

101
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,742
One does not behave so rudely
as a guest in another's residence.

102
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,742
Brother, you mustn't let this slide.

103
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,303
You're right, Your Majesty.

104
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,782
It's all a misunderstanding.

105
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,744
My men went out of line
and deserve punishment.

106
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,983
Zi Shu, apologize to Sui Zhi at once.

107
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,460
My thoughtless actions were inexcusable.

108
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,599
I will punish myself
with three cups of wine.

109
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,463
Please forgive me, Flower Bird Envoy.

110
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,623
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

111
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,535
Even after married into King Ning's family,

112
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,343
you're still coveting my beloved.

113
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,663
Were it not for His Lordship's sake,

114
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,784
I'd have broken your other leg already.

115
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
My Lord...

116
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
You used to trust me and
treat me like one of your own.

117
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,703
But things have changed since
Liu Chang married into your family.

118
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,703
Is it that I've lost your faith,

119
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
or that he's been planting
doubts in your mind?

120
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,439
Now that you've searched my residence,

121
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,193
uncovered even my private chamber.

122
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,503
If there's anything
else you want to search,

123
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,022
go ahead and search it.

124
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,983
At least then I won't have
to keep living on edge,

125
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,663
not knowing where I stand.

126
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,223
Sui Zhi, get up.

127
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,823
Get up.

128
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,183
Don't say things like that.

129
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,733
What happened today was
all Zi Shu acting on his own.

130
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,022
You're like family to me.

131
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,103
How could I ever doubt you?

132
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,679
I believe that.

133
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,662
My brother would never
sanction such behavior.

134
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,193
Since we've talked it out,

135
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,742
why are we still here?

136
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,840
Brother, you will drink until you drop.

137
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Drink until I drop.

138
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,399
Come on, Sui Zhi.

139
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,215
Let's drink until we drop.

140
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,943
It was all thanks to Mu Dan today.

141
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,800
(A husband's companionship
is the best medicine.)

142
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
So,

143
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
you already knew who I am.

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,986
It was never my intention to deceive you,

145
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,120
but some matters can bring harm
instead of good if not kept secret.

146
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,576
Your Majesty, you carry
the weight of the nation,

147
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,360
and you have provided
secret aid many times.

148
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,782
I'm deeply grateful for it.

149
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,720
So I will guard your secret with my life.

150
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,782
King Ning has left.

151
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,742
You don't have to act anymore.

152
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,742
I should've been more vigilant

153
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,416
after Liu Chang nearly
searched the estate last time.

154
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,775
I've played the decadent man so long,

155
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,079
I thought the act was foolproof.

156
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,142
I never imagined they'd
dare break down my walls.

157
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,502
I underestimated King Ning's paranoia.

158
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,943
I should've been more prepared.

159
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,463
No one is perfect.

160
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,742
Even the best can't predict everything.

161
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,862
Just be more cautious going forward.

162
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,983
Too many lives depend on me.

163
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,823
One mistake,

164
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,303
years of planning could go up in smoke.

165
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,039
I wouldn't be able to atone for it

166
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,423
even with my life.

167
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,679
You've taken on the burden

168
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,262
of this nation for my sake.

169
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,400
You've served with absolute loyalty.

170
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,240
You shouldn't blame yourself.

171
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,519
If anyone

172
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,120
failed to think things through, it was me.

173
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,560
Yes, Your Majesty, you did
fail to think things through.

174
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,862
Didn't we agree?

175
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:13,056
If there was ever a risk of exposure,

176
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,999
you were to cut all ties
with me immediately.

177
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Outside that secret chamber,

178
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,762
you should've gone along
with King Ning's suspicion of me.

179
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:21,026
You shouldn't have defended me.

180
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,342
I know I promised you.

181
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,039
But when the moment came,
how could I bring myself to do it?

182
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,742
Precisely because we're like brothers,

183
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,223
you must be willing to sacrifice me.

184
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
If we ever face danger like that again,

185
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,502
you have to abandon me.

186
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
San Lang,

187
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,480
for the peaceful future
we are fighting for...

188
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Promise me.

189
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,919
Sui Zhi...

190
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:12,825
I promise.

191
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,703
An empire needs wise counsel,

192
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,096
and great deeds await
those with the courage to act.

193
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,760
Though I'm just a humble flower merchant,

194
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,223
my loyalty is sworn.

195
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,343
Should you ever have
need of me, Your Majesty,

196
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,622
I will give everything I have to help.

197
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Please rise.

198
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,583
You are brave and loyal.

199
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,520
Sui Zhi is fortunate to
have you by his side.

200
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,360
And I'm fortunate to have
crossed paths with you as well.

201
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,919
We are more than just ruler and subject.

202
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,840
When we must play our roles,

203
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,463
please call me San Lang again.

204
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Treat me like a friend.

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,862
My Lord, surely you're not believing
Jiang Chang Yang's slander?

206
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,262
My loyalty to you is absolute.

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,343
He brought up He Wei
Fang purely to sow discord.

208
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,142
Whether I believe you
or not doesn't matter.

209
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,262
What I want is results.

210
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,782
Forgive me for failing

211
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,183
to find any tangible
evidence to expose him.

212
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,063
But the way he panicked today,

213
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,476
he must be hiding
something in his residence.

214
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,504
You think I didn't sense that?

215
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,302
But I've tested him more than once,

216
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,169
and he's never slipped.

217
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,062
He's clearly on guard now.

218
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,742
From here on, we must tread carefully.

219
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,782
Unless you're certain the strike will land,

220
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,022
do not act recklessly.

221
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,519
Yes, I understand.

222
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,040
This is the whip I use for interrogations.

223
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,159
While restoring Fang Garden lately,

224
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,742
I've learned many charming
yet economical decoration tricks.

225
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,623
With me, an unscrupulous
profiteer, as your ally now,

226
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,623
I'll ensure you always turn a profit.

227
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Jiang Chang Yang,

228
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,223
you needn't wear masks with me anymore.

229
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,983
What I'm involved in is dangerous.

230
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,120
You could've stayed out of it and
run your little business in peace.

231
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,719
Why throw yourself into this mess?

232
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,735
The selfish think only of themselves.

233
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,206
The honorable think of the country.

234
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:13,183
Though I'm a woman, I too have patriotism.

235
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Besides,

236
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,039
with corrupt officials
strangling the people,

237
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,183
how could any merchant thrive?

238
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Everything I'm doing,

239
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,463
it's not just for your
cause, it's for mine too.

240
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,000
Now come on, stop looking so grim.

241
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,496
That sulking face doesn't go well

242
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,040
with this little pleasure
den I decorated for you.

243
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,782
Speaking of this,

244
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,870
how did you manage to arrange
all this in such a short time?

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Madam He?

246
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,040
You're also Jiang Chang Yang's man?

247
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,463
Perfect! Help me set the place up now!

248
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,720
Set up what? I've removed
anything suspicious.

249
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,584
How can Jiang Chang
Yang's men be this dense?

250
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,320
If King Ning searches
this place and finds nothing,

251
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,663
he'll get even more suspicious!

252
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,700
No one goes to the trouble
of hiding an empty room.

253
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Understood?

254
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,160
- Now hurry. - Yes, my lady.

255
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,312
Wait.

256
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
What is this?

257
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,502
Th-this was mistakenly
seized with the coded letters.

258
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,883
I hadn't disposed of it
yet. I'll take it away now.

259
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Leave it.

260
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,119
It'll come in handy.

261
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Young Master.

262
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,119
Where is She Yan?

263
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,720
He was afraid you'd scold
him, so he left already.

264
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,983
It all happened so suddenly.

265
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,959
It's perfectly normal
to be caught off guard.

266
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,502
It was all thanks to him just now.

267
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,143
His martial arts skills saved
me a ton of time and effort.

268
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,719
Without him,

269
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,744
I couldn't have staged all
that before Liu Chang arrived.

270
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,279
She Yan asked me to pass his thanks.

271
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:18,512
He also left this for you.

272
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:20,495
He shouldn't have.

273
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,022
This wind chime is adored
with wild goose feathers.

274
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,279
It symbolizes lifelong partnership.

275
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:29,996
He said your anniversary is approaching,

276
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,775
and that he might be
away when the day comes.

277
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,599
So he wanted to give
you his gift in advance.

278
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,896
You haven't forgotten
your anniversary, have you?

279
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,039
Of course not. How
could we possibly forget?

280
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,143
How quickly time slips by.

281
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,863
I wonder how many more
years I'll get to spend with you.

282
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,463
At the New Year's court assembly,

283
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,542
envoys from distant lands crossed
thousands of miles to pay tribute.

284
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,280
It's a great honor and
blessing for our empire.

285
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,959
Now, as we gather for this
Spring Commencement feast,

286
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,143
I have specially invited all
ministers and their families to join in

287
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
this joyous occasion and share in
the prosperity of our flourishing age.

288
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,703
We are deeply honored by
your generosity, Your Majesty.

289
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,236
Allow us to offer our wishes.

290
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,903
May the Tang Dynasty
flourish for all eternity!

291
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,944
May the Tang Dynasty
flourish for all eternity!

292
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,759
Not now.

293
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,943
This is tribute bamboo rice from Nanzhao.

294
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,420
His Majesty gifted it to all noble
households on New Year's Eve.

295
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,531
Though of course, Lord Jiang knew merchants

296
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,583
don't deserve delicacies
meant for nobility.

297
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,199
Did he not bother to send
you even a single portion to try?

298
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,720
The holidays are the busiest
season for Blooming Abode.

299
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
I had accounts piling up to check.

300
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,423
I had no time to fuss over meals.

301
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,502
You reek of money.

302
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,943
So dreadfully vulgar.

303
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,360
Well, the stench of money might be strong,

304
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,400
but it's everyone else
who has to endure it.

305
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,582
Behind closed doors,

306
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,156
all that matters is that
my life is comfortable.

307
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,319
Wouldn't you agree?

308
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,839
Lord Jiang.

309
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,623
My wife's hands are for
tending flowers and her passions.

310
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,542
Mundane matters like this

311
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,342
is my job.

312
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,399
My dear, you're earning a lot of money.

313
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,143
You can buy anything your heart desires,

314
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
but don't forget to spare
a little attention for me too.

315
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,302
After the festivities,

316
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,640
how about we spend a few
quiet days in Lishan Mountain?

317
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Your Majesty,

318
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,680
the warriors of your great empire
are unmatched in swordsmanship.

319
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,703
Ashi Na Dan, my youngest daughter,

320
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,759
has long desired to test
her skills against them.

321
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,126
Would you grant her
this honor, Your Majesty?

322
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,359
Granted.

323
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Well done!

324
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,703
Yes! Yes!

325
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
That's good!

326
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,143
Yes! Yes!

327
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Yes!

328
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,863
They say Princess Ashi Na Dan
is the Celestial Flower of the Plains.

329
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,559
Seeing her now, the tales don't lie.

330
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,583
Such brilliance and spirit,

331
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,983
she rivals any man.

332
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,637
Your Majesty,

333
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,863
don't you think this
Celestial Flower would make

334
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,077
a splendid match for
the ruler of an empire?

335
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Father!

336
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,302
The princess has
impressive skill, no doubt.

337
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,062
But for a mighty empire's
warrior to lose to a woman,

338
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,863
it's quite embarrassing, no?

339
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,822
Our nation is one of decorum and civility.

340
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,040
Guests are to be treated with courtesy.

341
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,903
In a friendly match, a
little restraint is only proper.

342
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,143
Envoy, your words are out of line.

343
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,183
Perhaps you'd do well to take a
few scrolls of the Nine Classics home,

344
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,863
and refresh your understanding
of proper decorum.

345
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,663
The princess is beautiful and vibrant.

346
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,943
How could our warriors strike
earnestly when faced with such radiance

347
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,983
Princess, would you honor
me with a friendly match?

348
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Gladly!

349
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,709
Yes! That's good!

350
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:06,936
Princess of Juebei, bullseye!

351
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,262
Consort Shu, bullseye!

352
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,502
They were evenly
matched in spear and sword,

353
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,943
now even their archery is neck and neck.

354
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,996
How long will it take
to determine a winner?

355
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,079
Yes.

356
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,863
Ever since Consort Shu
gave birth to the royal heir,

357
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,383
her health hasn't been the same.

358
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,639
She has been taking tonics.

359
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,476
If this goes on much longer,

360
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,663
she might not have the strength to keep up.

361
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,143
If she loses,

362
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,726
it'll be the imperial
family's pride on the line.

363
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,797
Consort Shu, bullseye!

364
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,542
Princess of Juebei, bullseye!

365
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,039
Again!

366
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Your Majesty.

367
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,199
Target shooting feels rather dull,

368
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,140
might we instead shoot plum blossoms?

369
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,735
The buds are small and sway with the wind,

370
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,040
making them difficult to hit.

371
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,119
It would be a true test of skill,

372
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,759
and far more graceful to watch.

373
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,580
Consort Shu, Princess,

374
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,279
what do you think?

375
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,983
Consort Shu wins!

376
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,262
Well done!

377
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,599
Marvelous!

378
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,623
Consort Shu displays peerless skill,

379
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,559
while the Princess
radiates celestial grace.

380
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,183
This contest has been a true delight.

381
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,599
That's right.

382
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,342
Consort Shu, your skill surpasses
mine. I yield with full respect.

383
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,342
It was a pleasure to
exchange skill in friendship.

384
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,500
In our tradition, we gift gathered
branches to honored guests.

385
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,342
Princess, please accept this plum
branch as a keepsake of your visit.

386
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,319
Thank you, Consort Shu.

387
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,302
Meager plum blossoms
for a gift? How modest.

388
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,743
I heard your great empire
is famed for its peonies,

389
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,216
unmatched in beauty, the
very symbol of national grace.

390
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,983
Yet today we see none.

391
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,904
Does your empire deem

392
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,703
our borderland delegation
unworthy of such splendor

393
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,319
and are deliberately withholding them?

394
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,822
Envoy, you're mistaken.

395
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,800
The nature follow its own rhythms.

396
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,302
The seasons turn neither
for sages nor tyrants.

397
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,663
The peony simply isn't in season.

398
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,903
How could that be called concealment?

399
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,822
So the grandeur of your empire

400
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,383
is nothing but surface shine.

401
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,262
Your famed prosperity withers with winter.

402
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,703
Not like our Nanzhao,

403
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,756
where it's spring all year round,
vibrant and ever-blossoming.

404
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,542
Spring all year round,

405
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,302
and yet you can't stop flowers
from blooming and withering.

406
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,542
Your land merely rides nature's coattails.

407
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,022
What's there to boast about?

408
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,463
Porcelain, tea leaves,

409
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,383
cotton and silk,

410
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,183
the day you no longer rely
on us to supply these things,

411
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,199
then you may speak of superiority.

412
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,599
They say

413
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,696
your emperor is like the Son of Heaven.

414
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
If that's so,

415
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,423
can he defy nature's timing

416
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:55,223
and make peonies bloom in snow?

417
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,055
His Majesty governs
within to unify the states,

418
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,559
and pacifies the outer tribes beyond.

419
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,880
Tending flowers would
be a waste of his greatness.

420
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,599
But my wife

421
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:22,890
happens to have this particular talent.

422
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,742
I was told noblewomen of your empire
live sheltered behind closed doors.

423
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,742
The servants did everything for them.

424
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,959
Are you saying your wife
grows flowers herself?

425
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,582
Not only does she grow them herself,

426
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,280
she's also the renowned owner of
Chang'an's famed Blooming Abode,

427
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,519
He Wei Fang.

428
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,742
The famed Fragrant Sleeves,

429
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,143
Jade Orchid and Moutan peony

430
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,143
are her creations.

431
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,199
Your Majesty,

432
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,516
in Juebei, winters are
long and summers are short.

433
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,256
The land lies under
snow for much of the year

434
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,062
We've never seen flowers bloom in the snow.

435
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,502
If your great empire can
make peonies bloom in snow,

436
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,743
then we would be honored
to witness such a marvel.

437
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,502
I will not fail this task.

438
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,343
In eight days' time, I shall
present a snow-blooming peony,

439
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,680
a tribute to the beauty
and grace of the empire.

440
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,956
To gather and admire such a flower together

441
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,055
will be a symbol of friendship
between our nations.

442
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,022
When the peony blooms in the snow,

443
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,423
you are all welcome to our
Imperial Garden for the viewing.

444
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,757
Have some water, Madam.

445
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,575
I'm fine, thank you. Give
them to Da Fu and the others.

446
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,599
Alright.

447
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,823
Hurry, close the door.

448
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,120
Don't let the warm air escape!

449
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,863
Why are you bringing the food today?

450
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,039
Where is Da Fu?

451
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,880
She's snowball fighting with Chuan Yu.

452
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,079
Come eat now. Your stomach
gets upset if you eat cold food.

453
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
It's good.

454
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
What is this?

455
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:00,554
Today's the Shunxing Festival.

456
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,958
I was supposed to

457
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,463
go to Kaiyuan Temple today
to light a lamp for my mother.

458
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,159
But I got so busy I forgot about it.

459
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,142
Your fake husband went for you.

460
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:16,903
I even gave a generous offering.

461
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,263
These lamps are from the temple.

462
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:24,022
Tradition says you
have to light nine of them.

463
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,783
So the gods can see them

464
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,182
and bless you with a smooth
and peaceful new year.

465
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Here.

466
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,542
We're grasshoppers tied on one string now.

467
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,702
If misfortune trips you,

468
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,464
I'll stumble too.

469
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:01,662
So I'm sharing half of
these prayer lamps with you.

470
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Jiang Chang Yang.

471
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,983
You brought me food,

472
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,823
visited my mother for me,

473
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,293
and even lit lamps for me.

474
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,222
You've done...

475
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,463
So much for me.

476
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,880
Like you said, we're allies.

477
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:49,906
You're here working hard for His Majesty.

478
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,903
I can't grow flowers,

479
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,702
the least I can do is taking
care of other things for you.

480
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,102
It's almost the deadline.

481
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,916
Will these peonies really bloom on time?

482
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,239
Of course.

483
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,079
They can't talk. How would you know?

484
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,062
I can tell by the firmness of the buds

485
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,022
roughly when they'll bloom.

486
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Really?

487
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,519
Look.

488
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,903
If the bud feels

489
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,542
as firm as the bones in your finger,

490
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,343
it still needs about a month.

491
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,081
If it's softened to about the
firmness of your fingertip,

492
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,622
then it's only about five days away.

493
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,439
And once it feels like
the base of your thumb...

494
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,079
Jiang Chang Yang.

495
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,502
Why are you blushing?

496
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,264
It's too warm in here.

497
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,319
I'm going out to get some air.

498
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Wait.

499
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
It's cold outside.

500
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Put this on.

501
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,304
Don't catch a chill.
