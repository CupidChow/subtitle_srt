1
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:37,931
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,960
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,070
When can we see the peonies?

4
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,575
Don't be impatient.

5
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:00,671
The paintings on the screens

6
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,591
were created by the palace artists.

7
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,676
You guys may admire them
before the peonies bloom.

8
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,943
These are the customs
and traditions of Tang.

9
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,422
They're interesting indeed.

10
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,103
These paintings are very vivid.

11
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,392
These paintings are very exquisite.

12
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,586
You guys are covering
things up with bluffs.

13
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,862
Could it be that there were no
peonies that could bloom in the snow?

14
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,862
He does have a point.

15
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,411
Envoy, you may not know this.

16
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,823
Tang, which is rich in spirit and
talent, pursues all things with style.

17
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,479
Warming wine beneath the moon,
brewing tea in wait for spring's breeze.

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,149
We're willing to wait for the best
timing to admire the best flowers.

19
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,395
It's a shame that Nanzhao
doesn't have such customs.

20
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:00,663
We've been waiting for eight days.

21
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,336
Isn't that long enough?

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,383
Time is almost up, yet
no flowers are to be seen.

23
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,422
Your Majesty, don't tell me
you were tricking us all along.

24
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,455
I believe that Lord Jiang
won't break his promise.

25
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,319
Please wait patiently.

26
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,103
The time has arrived.

27
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,558
Look! The flowers have bloomed!

28
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,742
- Father, look! - Excellent.

29
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,102
These peonies actually bloomed in the snow.

30
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,783
This is only a magnificent
scene that can be seen in Tang.

31
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,942
Indeed. His Majesty kept his promise.

32
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,919
The lady gardener is
well-versed in her craft.

33
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,957
This is my first time seeing
peonies. It's actually in winter as well.

34
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,079
Look at the pink one.

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,023
Not bad at all.

36
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,268
Excellent.

37
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,703
Look. There are flying birds.

38
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,903
A hundred flowers bloom

39
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,436
as a hundred birds pay homage.

40
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,196
May Tang be graced by blessings,

41
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,262
and may peace grace
our state and its people.

42
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,717
May Tang be graced by blessings,

43
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,783
and may peace grace
our state and its people.

44
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,822
Everyone, please rise.

45
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,502
Thank you, Your Majesty.

46
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,020
Why did you make us wait when
the peonies had already bloomed?

47
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,422
Did you guys delay the moment on
purpose in order to show your authority?

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,556
- The envoy has a point. - Indeed.

49
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,822
I suppose that's possible.

50
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,703
Why did we have to wait so long?

51
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,336
To urge blossoms in winter, one must
first gather enough warmth and light.

52
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,903
It's the hottest at the hour of Wu.

53
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,538
Only then will they be able to bloom.

54
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,346
The way of Dongyu was
not paved by a single stone,

55
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,502
nor were the lands of Heluo and
Tianzhong nourished by one spring alone.

56
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,016
The flourishing of Tang is
neither the work of a single day,

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,343
nor the gift of a single region.

58
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,727
It's the result of all regions coming
together, united in will and effort.

59
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,556
Initially, I thought women in upper
states were like birds in a cage.

60
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,622
I thought they lost their
freedom upon marriage.

61
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,119
Yet here you are now,
displaying your skills before all.

62
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,663
This is impressive indeed.

63
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,223
I remember that your name is

64
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,543
He Wei Fang.

65
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,622
What does your name imply?

66
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,422
My mother loved peonies.

67
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,543
She hoped that I could live like the peony,

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,382
radiant in virtue, and
graceful in character.

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,676
The world praises the peony

70
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,862
for its graceful grandeur and
unmatched beauty among all blossoms.

71
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,143
I'm sure your mother gave you that name

72
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,103
because she cherished you.

73
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,942
What Mother wishes for me is
not unmatched wealth and splendor.

74
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,776
Your Highness, do you know this?

75
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,223
Grown on craggy slopes and amidst the wild,

76
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,862
peonies brave wind and storm,

77
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,543
yet blossoms still.

78
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,343
I think Mother gave me that name

79
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,903
so that I could have the
perseverance of the peonies.

80
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,759
This way, no matter what
kind of difficulties I face,

81
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,001
I'm able to overcome
them with my resilience.

82
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,543
I see.

83
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,233
Wei Fang.

84
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:19,565
The peonies.

85
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,903
I remember you now.

86
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,343
Today, the flowers have
bloomed in the snow.

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,103
It's a sight like no other.

88
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,502
I'm very pleased.

89
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,721
Bring me a brush.

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,032
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,023
He Wei Fang has a trade that
runs deep through Chang'an.

92
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,422
She has eased my burden
and brought honor to the state.

93
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,543
In praise of her wisdom, she
is deemed worthy of reward.

94
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,182
I hereby bestow her the title of
Chief Flower Merchant of the State.

95
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,640
She shall receive my personal writing,

96
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,343
"The Nation's Blooming Grace."

97
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,543
Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,103
King Ning has set up a family banquet.

99
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,223
He has invited all of the officials there.

100
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,943
I'm afraid he's trying to win them over.

101
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,795
He...

102
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,943
Strange.

103
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,063
What happened between you two?

104
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,943
There are no outsiders
here. There's no need to act.

105
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,782
She was rewarded today.

106
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,622
She should enjoy her
glorious moment herself.

107
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,999
There's no need for me to bother her.

108
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,423
What's wrong with you and Sui Zhi?

109
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,423
There's nothing between us.

110
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,703
Consort Shu, what about you?

111
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,480
You've been traveling together
with His Majesty all this while.

112
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
Why does it still feel
like you're depressed?

113
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,343
Princess Ashi Na Dan was
accompanying us as well.

114
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,622
His Majesty treated her dearly.

115
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,862
I think he's going to say
yes to the marriage alliance.

116
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,862
Consort Shu, have you told His
Majesty that you were upset about that?

117
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,823
Consorts and concubines are the same
as subjects. We have to obey orders.

118
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,120
It's all for the sake
of the state's stability.

119
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,662
But why do I feel like

120
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,960
His Majesty would've issued a
decree long ago had he agreed to it?

121
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,255
You kept everything and didn't
tell him what was on your mind.

122
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,502
What if he was thinking
of the same thing as you?

123
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,582
It's already a privilege to
stay beside His Majesty.

124
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:01,240
I dare not hope for a meeting of hearts.

125
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:07,154
Mu Dan, sometimes,
I'm truly envious of you.

126
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,759
Instead of guessing each other's
thoughts and understanding them in secret,

127
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,058
why don't you be direct with him?

128
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,096
That which is most unspeakable lies
deepest. What lies deep remains unseen.

129
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,622
By hiding your broken heart,

130
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,480
you're hiding your true self as well.

131
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,303
The true feelings of His Majesty

132
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,650
were neither spoken nor tested.

133
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,559
How would you be able to see them clearly?

134
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,662
Come, Sui Zhi.

135
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,943
In liquor, truth is revealed.

136
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:45,697
Just follow my advice.

137
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,948
Pretend to be drunk or asleep
during suitable moments,

138
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,597
and you might be able to see
His Majesty's true feelings for you.

139
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,146
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

140
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,880
The palace gate has already been shut.

141
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
As for Flower Bird Envoy and his spouse...

142
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,056
Sui Zhi and his spouse have
worked hard for the past few days.

143
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,542
They'll spend the night in the palace.

144
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,154
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,799
Ashi Na Dan is radiant in
looks and unbound in nature.

146
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
She's just like the past version of you.

147
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,622
Would you be the same as her

148
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,622
had you not entered the palace?

149
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,603
The northern lords have
proposed a marriage alliance.

150
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,135
Ling Ge.

151
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,366
Are you not asleep?

152
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,622
I couldn't hold my liquor well.

153
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,320
I shall take my leave first.

154
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,039
The northern wind chills the bone.

155
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,279
There's no need to
return at this late hour.

156
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,142
Chat with me.

157
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,021
Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,902
What do you think about
the marriage alliance?

159
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,181
Establishing a marriage
alliance with the northern lords

160
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,063
secures the peace of the state.

161
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,983
This isn't the imperial court.

162
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,902
I'm asking you, Huangfu Ling Ge.

163
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,382
I've been your consort for many years.

164
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,022
Now, I'm only known as Consort Shu.

165
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,622
I'm sure you resent me.

166
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,943
You resent me for accepting
Brother's betrothal back then.

167
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,303
That's why you were trapped in the palace.

168
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,004
All these years,

169
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
it's either you moved to the side palace

170
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,162
or feigned illness to live in seclusion.

171
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
I'm sure you did so out of resentment.

172
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,703
You may resent me if you want.

173
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,823
I won't blame you for it.

174
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,823
I just hope that you won't
forget about King Lang.

175
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,742
Please take care of yourself for his sake.

176
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,043
I'm experiencing a hint
of depression after birth.

177
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,838
It's all due to my nature.

178
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:35,152
Your Majesty, I dare not blame you for it.

179
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,742
Do you think I have no idea
about the person you were before?

180
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,520
You were more carefree
and lively than Ashi Na Dan.

181
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,622
You only became like this

182
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,703
after you became my consort.

183
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,759
Your Majesty, you're overthinking it.

184
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,703
I've never resented you.

185
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,079
To balance the imperial court,

186
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,039
expand the imperial harem, and
ensure the continuation of the bloodline,

187
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,640
those are all of your responsibilities.

188
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I must also uphold the virtue of
declining your favor for the greater good.

189
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,128
Your Majesty, if you fancy
the princess of the north,

190
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,563
I shall prepare a grand
wedding for you all.

191
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,332
All right.

192
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,320
I shall issue a decree immediately.

193
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,520
Consort Shu, grind my ink for me.

194
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,782
The days of youth

195
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,102
now feel like a lifetime ago.

196
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,399
Back then,

197
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,183
you gave Brother a bow
and arrows that you made.

198
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,302
However, you gave me

199
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,143
a Xuan brush that you made
from the leftover materials.

200
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,822
I knew that you had no feelings for me.

201
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,302
Even so, I still cherished it a lot.

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,342
I didn't expect myself

203
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,400
to be this reluctant to part with it.

204
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,719
Not only does it hurt other people,

205
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,782
but it also hurts myself.

206
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,183
Why don't we end this today?

207
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
Both of them were made
of the same golden nanmu.

208
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,531
How would you know which of the
two were made from leftover materials?

209
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,903
Could it be that this brush

210
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,240
was the true representation
of your feelings?

211
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,760
Your Majesty, you're
the ruler of the world.

212
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,383
You only married me out of duty.

213
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,159
There's no need to care
about my true feelings.

214
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,822
The ink is ready.

215
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,200
Your Majesty, please issue the decree.

216
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:54,735
Stop saying that you're
a subject and I'm a ruler.

217
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,160
Don't try to brush me off.

218
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,719
If you merely saw me
as the ruler of the state,

219
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,223
if so, you're guilty
of deceiving the ruler.

220
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,172
Ling Ge made this brush

221
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,983
and gave it to San Lang.

222
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,423
Right now, the person in front of you

223
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,033
is still San Lang.

224
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,204
Ling Ge,

225
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,302
I just want you to give
me an honest answer.

226
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,223
My thoughts are fixed on you,

227
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,502
unshifting as fate.

228
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,582
Yet, you remain unaware.

229
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,423
What can I do?

230
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,279
I was very lucky that I was married
to you instead of your brother.

231
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,582
But I dare not expect

232
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,839
the ruler of the state to fall for me.

233
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,822
We were too shy to speak of love.

234
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,760
That's why we ended up like this.

235
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:22,741
Ling Ge,

236
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,502
in the future,

237
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,863
let's pledge our hearts to one another.

238
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,719
We mustn't miss out on each other again.

239
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,623
Are you still awake?

240
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,116
I can't sleep.

241
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,041
What about you? Why are you awake as well?

242
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,559
His Majesty was afraid that
it might be too cold for us.

243
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,119
But now, the furnace is too hot.

244
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
How can I sleep when it's this hot?

245
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,800
Why are you covering
yourself with the blanket

246
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,440
when it's this hot?

247
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,822
If both of us can't sleep,

248
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,863
why don't we sit up

249
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,822
and have a chat?

250
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:04,550
Sure.

251
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,623
Let's talk about

252
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,262
when you decided to be the loathful
and detestable Flower Bird Envoy.

253
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,542
It's all in the past.

254
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:28,991
There's no point bringing it up.

255
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,431
Fine, then.

256
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,703
Let's talk about

257
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,022
what you plan to do after this.

258
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,078
Maybe I can help you out.

259
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:42,481
You've already done a lot for me.

260
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,080
What will happen after this

261
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,359
won't be something that you can endure.

262
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,822
You shouldn't endure it either.

263
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,143
During times of danger,

264
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,262
I'll escort you out of Chang'an.

265
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:05,031
It's not that I cannot endure the trial.

266
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,639
It's that you don't believe I can
share the same burden with you.

267
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,091
Isn't that so?

268
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,094
I faked the marriage to
rescue you in the first place.

269
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,924
If I drag you down now, it'll be the
opposite of what I intend to achieve.

270
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,518
You have your own life to lead.

271
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,775
Your friends and family, and your
business, you have to consider them all.

272
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,735
You shouldn't get yourself
involved in political struggles.

273
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,223
How would you know about
the kind of life I want to lead?

274
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,456
It's cold and full of snow here.
I want to check out the flowers.

275
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,320
The security in the palace is tight.
We cannot move without permission.

276
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,009
The peonies from the Imperial Garden

277
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:15,669
have all been moved to the
side palace's warm chamber.

278
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,008
It's right next to our room.

279
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,383
We can sneak over there.

280
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,782
One may hasten the blossoms

281
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,943
against the season,

282
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,742
yet such beauty lasts but a moment.

283
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,821
Seems like all things in the world

284
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,582
cannot be forced.

285
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,439
Instead of being melancholic,
we should cherish the moment.

286
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,582
I shall keep you company.

287
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,772
Every moment we spend
admiring the blooming flowers

288
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,542
brings us joy.

289
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,822
I'm not drunk.

290
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,320
It must've been tough on you lately.

291
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,863
Sleep well.

292
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
I'm only going to sleep for two hours.

293
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,383
You have to wake me up later.

294
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,903
I want to admire the flowers.

295
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,124
All right.

296
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,649
And...

297
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,542
The writing that His
Majesty has granted to me,

298
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,342
we need to pick an auspicious date

299
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,863
and move it to Fang Garden.

300
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,342
Okay.

301
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,183
Jiang Chang Yang.

302
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,663
I fancy you.

303
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,903
Even if joining you means

304
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,183
that I might be risking my life,

305
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,383
I have no fear

306
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,143
and no regrets.

307
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,383
I think that's Xue Xi.

308
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,720
Xue Xi.

309
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,187
Mu Dan?

310
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,240
Xue Xi, you're back.

311
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,542
When did you come back?

312
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,519
I've already been home for two days.

313
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,425
I was keeping Princess Royal
company in her residence.

314
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,636
She always preferred peace and quiet.

315
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,072
That's why she didn't attend the banquet.

316
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:31,056
Are you heading to the
palace to see His Majesty?

317
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:33,654
Princess Royal said she missed you.

318
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,711
She instructed me to
invite you to her residence.

319
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:38,416
You guys can take your time to catch up.

320
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,480
You see, I have things to
attend to at Fang Garden.

321
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,703
Flower Bird Envoy, I'll head
back using your carriage first.

322
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,507
Sure.

323
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,535
Let's catch up again next time.

324
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,605
All right.

325
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,255
Once you're done sending Madam He home,

326
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,896
pick me up at Princess Royal's Residence.

327
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,542
- Yes, sir. - Go now.

328
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,720
I've already left for quite some time.

329
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,302
Have you not confessed to Mu Dan yet?

330
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,493
I shall confess to her
on the Lantern Festival.

331
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,502
That's more like it.

332
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,423
What's your plan? I'll help you out.

333
00:31:49,968 --> 00:31:51,038
Mu Dan.

334
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,342
Da Fu, what's going on?

335
00:31:57,998 --> 00:31:59,043
Yeah.

336
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,211
Yeah.

337
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,526
Guys, what are you all...

338
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:02,821
Madam He, you've returned.

339
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,597
- Madam He. - Madam He.

340
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,143
You're holding the writing
of His Majesty himself.

341
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,495
It's the first time the Flower
Association has received such an honor.

342
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,502
We owe this good
fortune to your kind favor.

343
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:13,772
Indeed.

344
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,698
Scholars, farmers, artisans, and
merchants form the four classes.

345
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:18,106
People always looked
down on merchants like us.

346
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,262
Thanks to you, Madam He,

347
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,329
flower merchants like us are
finally able to show off for once.

348
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,276
This isn't my credit alone.

349
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,663
The palace gardeners and everyone in
Fang Garden have contributed as well.

350
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,342
You guys truly flatter me.

351
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,797
Da Fu, you can resume your work.

352
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,079
Keep this well.

353
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,578
Madam He.

354
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,434
Leader Lv?

355
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,232
Leader Lv.

356
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,633
What are you...

357
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,102
Madam He, you managed
to nurture the snow peony.

358
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,423
Your glorious deeds have been
spread throughout Chang'an.

359
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,410
No matter if it's gardening skills

360
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,376
or fulfilling the duties
of a flower merchant,

361
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,983
you've bested me at both.

362
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:02,216
It's time for me to give up my position.

363
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,463
Leader Lv, I have no
intention of replacing you.

364
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,183
Moreover, you've managed the association
for many years. I cannot do that.

365
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,302
The association thrived for decades
because we elected capable individuals.

366
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,502
Madam He, now, you're the
Chief Flower Merchant of the State.

367
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,119
I'm sure you can bring our
association to even greater heights.

368
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:20,976
The others and I have already
come up with this decision.

369
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,143
Please do not refuse the offer.

370
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:33,223
These are the trade rules
of the Flower Association.

371
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,440
All those who have held this
position have left their names upon it.

372
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,302
I'll entrust the Flower
Association to you now.

373
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,102
Do I have the right to change
the trade rules if I'm the leader?

374
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,076
Naturally, as you're the
leader of the association.

375
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,822
All right. I'll accept your offer, then.

376
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,702
From today onward,

377
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,090
those who join the Flower
Association shall be seen as equal,

378
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:16,317
regardless of their gender.

379
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,320
They will be appointed
based on their abilities.

380
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,735
Leader.

381
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,863
It's difficult for women to manage shops.

382
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,879
Perhaps we can consider easing
their share of the association dues.

383
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,823
I didn't set up this rule for
women to have special rights.

384
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,743
What I seek is fairness.

385
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,263
Everyone makes a living
with their own hands.

386
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,279
Why should we classify
them based on gender?

387
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,192
If we provide them with
preferential treatment,

388
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:39,518
that'll only make people look
down on women even more.

389
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,843
Leader,

390
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,383
what do you think about the new rule?

391
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:46,888
It's excellent.

392
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:49,368
Before this, we were arrogant and aloof.

393
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,702
It's time to redress the
errors and mend our ways.

394
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,463
I'll definitely promote it.

395
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,102
Madam He, you've already
agreed to be the leader.

396
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,520
What do you mean by this?

397
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,102
I did agree to it.

398
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,347
But I didn't state how long
I would hold the position.

399
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,762
I was the leader for ten minutes.

400
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,383
I've amended the age-old
custom as well. That'll suffice.

401
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,320
This is not where my ambition lies.

402
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,463
Leader Lv is gentle and upright,

403
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,736
well-acquainted with the
members of the association,

404
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,022
and holds the association
most dear to his heart.

405
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,343
It's most suitable for you

406
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:25,128
to be the leader of the association.

407
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,212
But...

408
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,021
Leader Lv, there's no need to be courteous.

409
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,270
Just accept it.

410
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,943
All right now. Now, it's
over. Do not bring it up again.

411
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,936
It's rare for you all to
gather at Fang Garden.

412
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,400
Why don't you guys stay here
and try out our seasonal dishes?

413
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,197
Sure.

414
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,549
Lord Pei.

415
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,159
Miss Xiao and our lord
have entered the palace.

416
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,823
Lord Pei, please come again next time.

417
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,516
It's the Lantern Festival.

418
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,317
Why is Sui Zhi traveling with Xue Xi

419
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,215
instead of spending time
with his spouse at home?

420
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,423
Princess Royal wants our lord to
celebrate the festival with Miss Xiao.

421
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,863
Naturally, he cannot refuse her.

422
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,695
Sui Zhi is very close to
her, who's an outsider.

423
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,783
Won't your mistress mind that?

424
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,222
Our mistress is generous and magnanimous.

425
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,263
She has already gone on a trip by herself.

426
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,199
Lord Pei, you need not worry.

427
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,343
If that's the case, I shall
visit you guys next time.

428
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,736
Madam, come and check out our hairpins.

429
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,197
Come. Over here.

430
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,354
I like them.

431
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,743
Look. They're beautiful.

432
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,885
Give them a try.

433
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,197
- Here, put it on. - No way.

434
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,359
I'm not doing it.

435
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,680
A pugilist like me would
never wear something like that.

436
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,343
It's pretty, you know?

437
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,542
You're getting older and older.

438
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,360
You have to doll yourself up more often.

439
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,062
Get yourself a husband this year.

440
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,142
If so, I can finally rest at ease.

441
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,936
Mother, you look great
when you doll yourself up.

442
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
Why don't you get yourself a husband?

443
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,542
I don't mind that.

444
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,530
Don't spout such nonsense.

445
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,239
How could you say something like that?

446
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,863
People might hear us.

447
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,371
Mu Dan, what's the matter?

448
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,519
Are you thinking about Lord Jiang's
visit to the palace with Miss Xiao?

449
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,920
The Lantern Festival is a festive
occasion throughout the state.

450
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,640
It's reasonable for families
to gather and be reunited.

451
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,702
I miss my family too.

452
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,983
If so, why don't you head
back to Luoyang to visit them?

453
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,823
- Okay. - All right.

454
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,071
You have no idea.

455
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,679
Mu Dan once wrote to her family
after her status was restored.

456
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,463
But her father wrote back, telling her

457
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,432
to stop showing herself in public
and do business when she's a slave.

458
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,936
He told her to get an official as husband

459
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,423
and lead a luxurious life.

460
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,636
If Mu Dan heads back,

461
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:50,102
they might force her to get married.

462
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,943
They won't do that.

463
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,800
It's not that Father doesn't love me.

464
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,943
He's just the same as Xiao Chun's father.

465
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,943
They think that getting married
is the best outcome for women.

466
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,343
Since there's no way to convince him,

467
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,080
we should lead our own lives.

468
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,336
It's good enough to write to
them during festive occasions.

469
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,135
Moreover, now,

470
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,102
I have you guys.

471
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,655
I'm already content.

472
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,582
- Here you go. - Okay. Thank you.

473
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,903
Madam, let's check out
the lanterns at Qu River.

474
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,679
Check out the lanterns? Sure.

475
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:20,967
Let's go.

476
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,502
Madam He.

477
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:42,077
Make it tighter.

478
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,596
You're just expressing your feelings.

479
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:49,863
You were never this nervous
even when you had to kill people.

480
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,542
Do not spill the tea
when you see Da Fu later.

481
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,743
It's best if Mu Dan is
willing to return immediately.

482
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,357
But if she's enjoying herself

483
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,200
and not willing to
return, do not force her.

484
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,423
I'm willing to wait for her.

485
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:03,511
Yes, My Lord.

486
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,657
I think my trip will take about one hour.

487
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,865
My Lord, you should use the
opportunity to test the switch

488
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:09,769
so that nothing will go
wrong when she arrives.

489
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,177
You're so long-winded.

490
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,322
Go now.

491
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,594
Yes, My Lord.

492
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,023
Jiang Chang Yang.

493
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,502
I heard from them that you
have something to show me.

494
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,710
In the past,

495
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,279
I only dared to express my
true feelings to the moon.

496
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,662
That's why you misunderstood
me, got upset over me,

497
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,343
and cried in your dreams.

498
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:41,936
From now on,

499
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,062
you don't need to stare
at the moon anymore.

500
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,743
I'm willing to join the moon

501
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,463
as we keep you company together.

502
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,144
We shall admire the flowers and the moon

503
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,269
until old age.

504
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,439
Though the moon may wax and wane,

505
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,430
we shall never par

506
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,430
Mu Dan,

507
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,142
are you willing

508
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,799
to spend the rest of your life with me?

509
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,171
Be careful.

510
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:43,659
My Lord!
