1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,912
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:40,880
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,543
Your Majesty.

4
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,063
The traitor is dead!

5
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,103
King Ning was loyal and brave!

6
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,742
He protected the emperor

7
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,823
and was an example of every official!

8
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,022
The government is facing this trouble.

9
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,462
My heart is raging with fire

10
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,862
and my sadness cannot be hidden.

11
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,582
I'll leave the mess

12
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,543
to you to settle.

13
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,383
Officials, listen to his orders

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,902
and not make any mistakes.

15
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,503
He is a traitor.

16
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,622
If you take another step forward,

17
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,920
you will also commit the crime of treason.

18
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,983
You'd better think twice.

19
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,195
(Jiang's Residence)

20
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:14,290
Hurry!

21
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:17,319
Over here!

22
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,319
- Why did Wuyong Clinic get seized? - You're right.

23
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,822
What happened to Madam He?

24
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,760
(Peerless Youthful Beauty)

25
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
You're awake?

26
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,742
I already have a husband.

27
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,622
Please behave yourself, Lord Liu.

28
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,463
Jiang Chang Yang is already dead.

29
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,062
A traitor's wife and concubine

30
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,062
will become slaves for officials.

31
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:49,894
He Wei Fang,

32
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
I'm the only one who can help you.

33
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,543
How you live in the future

34
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,703
depends on my mood.

35
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,663
Listen well.

36
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,983
From today onward,

37
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,560
you'll eat and live

38
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,463
on this mat.

39
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,463
I will come and visit you every day.

40
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,622
We are the only ones

41
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,583
who can accompany each other forever.

42
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,436
You still have such a temper

43
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,223
when you're already a trapped beast.

44
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,903
Don't hurt yourself.

45
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,207
Return it to me!

46
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,583
Return it to me!

47
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,839
Young Master!

48
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,023
- What is it? - The King is asking for you.

49
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
There's still a lot of time for us to be together.

50
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,393
Those who bring soldiers into the city unauthorized should be punished.

51
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,433
Enter the city!

52
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,382
His Majesty's decree is here!

53
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,502
All of you, heed the decree!

54
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,902
Here's His Majesty's decree.

55
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,703
All soldiers of the Hedong Army, pay attention!

56
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,375
The Flower Bird Envoy, Jiang Chang Yang,

57
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,360
colluded with the Master Commandant, Pei Zhong,

58
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,782
and started a rebellion at the Shaowei Banquet.

59
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,262
They killed the new
scholars and trusted aides.

60
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,343
Hedong's governor, Yu Chang,

61
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,463
protected his master and
sacrificed for his empire.

62
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,343
I am touched

63
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,520
and will grant his son, Yu Zheng,

64
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,542
the position of governor. He will be given the talisman

65
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,542
to carry out military executions at will.

66
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,583
The decree is written as such.

67
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,303
The talisman is given and the order must be executed.

68
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,183
That's impossible.

69
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,142
It's sudden.

70
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,983
His Majesty is in disbelief just like you are, General.

71
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,742
The new scholar, Zhang Qian, survived

72
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,799
and gave his testimony just now.

73
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,862
General, if you have any doubts,

74
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,262
you can ask him yourself.

75
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,639
I accept the decree.

76
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,781
General Yu,

77
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,079
the scene of the fire was a mess.

78
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,662
We only found the late General Yu's sword

79
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,103
and a few pieces of bone.

80
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,262
Please accept my condolences.

81
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Thank you.

82
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,063
The army cannot be without a general.

83
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,103
You are now the backbone of the Hedong Army.

84
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,862
- I wonder if you... - My father is dead.

85
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,440
I have no intention of working in governance.

86
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,063
I only want to return to Hedong

87
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,862
and mourn my father.

88
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,142
You should do your duties as a son first

89
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
before doing your duties as an official.

90
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,183
General, you can organize the army and rest tonight.

91
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,720
Tomorrow morning,

92
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,436
His Majesty will send
people to escort all of you

93
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,823
back to Hedong.

94
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,840
In a few days,

95
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,397
you've helped His Lordship turn over a crisis

96
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,542
and achieve victory.

97
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,742
I am impressed.

98
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,823
You are sensible.

99
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,000
Otherwise, you won't be sitting here

100
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,343
and drinking tea with me.

101
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,653
Yes.

102
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,823
You persuaded me back then

103
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,317
because we were affected by our background

104
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:28,471
and weren't appreciated.

105
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,400
I changed my mind in the end,

106
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,022
not because I was a coward,

107
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,583
but because I've seen

108
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,439
that only by following His Lordship

109
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,022
could I achieve my ambition.

110
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:43,535
His Majesty already has people he trusts.

111
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,551
He will never appreciate you.

112
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,280
You took the exam for nine years

113
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,920
before you became the imperial scholar.

114
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,382
If you are going to start from a local official,

115
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,303
you'll be wasting many more years of your life.

116
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,400
Young Master Liu, you understand me well.

117
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,918
I, Zhang Qian, will never

118
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,080
disappoint you and His Lordship's appreciation.

119
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,848
I've amended the way
to change the empire

120
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,400
after your guidance, Young Master Liu.

121
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,583
Please help me submit it to His Lordship.

122
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Why?

123
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,662
Those who are disloyal once

124
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,303
can no longer be used.

125
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,983
You are like me

126
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,303
but that is the version of myself

127
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,823
that I hate the most in my life.

128
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,463
Order everyone

129
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,262
to tighten the security of the new residence.

130
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,416
We must never allow the remnants of the traitors

131
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,000
to take advantage of any opportunities.

132
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:17,230
Yes.

133
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,183
My Lord, you are supposed to celebrate

134
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,862
for your victory.

135
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,183
Why are you behaving defensively?

136
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,240
Victory?

137
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,022
Look at what these people have done.

138
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,703
I've been patient for more than a decade.

139
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,525
I planted my men
in important positions

140
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,960
in the Ministries of Justice, Agriculture, Revenue and War.

141
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:52,631
Today,

142
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,477
if I hadn't made emergency plans because I scouted beforehand,

143
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,943
I would be the one

144
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,902
who died at Fang Garden.

145
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,943
You can only improve

146
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
if you face an enemy on your standard.

147
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,463
My Lord, you are
insightful and decisive.

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,542
Even if they spent so much effort,

149
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,463
they still ended up in a death trap.

150
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,343
Now, it's time for you
to play the next move.

151
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,782
The power in the
capital is in my palms.

152
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,399
However, there are still a few governors

153
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,622
who are stubborn.

154
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,183
I'm waiting for them to submit.

155
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,703
The change that happened today

156
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,423
will soon spread across the empire.

157
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,742
So, this matter
should not be forced

158
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,183
but another party should be used instead.

159
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:39,494
Yes.

160
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,382
Yu Zheng is...

161
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,400
He is dejected and only
wants to mourn his father.

162
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,823
He doesn't see things clearly.

163
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,862
He is not to be feared
if he's the only one.

164
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,142
However,

165
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,902
The Yu family still has old generals to support them.

166
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,292
The Hedong Army is brave in battle and loyal to their master.

167
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,640
We must be wary of them.

168
00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:07,140
Remember.

169
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,142
What I want

170
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,063
is to accept Heaven's mandate

171
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
and become someone who is accepted by all.

172
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,943
I understand.

173
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,917
I've planted spies in the convoy

174
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,303
to escort the Hedong Army.

175
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:24,000
If this blade cannot be used by you,

176
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,662
it should be broken instead.

177
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,195
When we've achieved our ambition,

178
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,382
you will become the only torch

179
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,583
in Chang'an

180
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,262
that shines all over the land

181
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,542
and ensure its prosperity.

182
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:53,997
It's not a festival.

183
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,542
Why are there so many palace guards?

184
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:56,966
I don't know.

185
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:01,480
- Xiao Chun. - Ye.

186
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,520
Faster!

187
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
Those at the back, faster!

188
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,782
It was fine when we left.

189
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,880
How...

190
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,183
When we rushed there,

191
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,542
We saw Lord Jiang and She Yan get carried out of Fang Garden.

192
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
The bodies on the ground were burned beyond recognition.

193
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,223
We couldn't find Mu Dan and Chuan Yu.

194
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,360
Impossible.

195
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,240
Chuan Yu is good at martial arts.

196
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:32,968
He will not die.

197
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,117
Mu Dan also promised to wait for us.

198
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,039
- She won't go back on her promise! - Yes.

199
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,022
Perhaps

200
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,223
they are hiding somewhere.

201
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,640
I'll go and find them.

202
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,400
Da Fu, come back!

203
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:47,191
We've searched everywhere we could.

204
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,105
Fang Garden and the Jiang Residence have been seized

205
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:50,496
and they are full of guarding soldiers.

206
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,917
- You'll die if you go now. - I don't care!

207
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,983
I'll find them even if I die!

208
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,981
- No! You can't go! - Let me go!

209
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,360
You can't go!

210
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,716
Mu Dan sent all of you away

211
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,903
to protect all of your lives.

212
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,463
You'll die if you go now.

213
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,542
You'll be wasting Mu Dan's hard work.

214
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,280
- But... - When you left to make the deliveries that day,

215
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,423
Madam He asked me to keep this box.

216
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,994
She told me to hand it to all of you when the time is right.

217
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,143
I didn't know what she meant

218
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
and asked her if something had happened

219
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,240
but she didn't say anything.

220
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,905
She only told me that I would know when the time comes.

221
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,423
Da Fu. Xiao Chun.

222
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,943
(When you read this letter, )

223
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,759
(I'm afraid I'm already in trouble.)

224
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,663
I've changed the
names on the deeds

225
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,079
of Blooming Abode, Qingshu Pavilion and Sheng County's Wuyong Clinic

226
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,183
to your names.

227
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,703
They won't be affected or seized.

228
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,983
These three shops
are my hopes for you

229
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,582
and my apology gifts.

230
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,423
I hope Leader Lv

231
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,397
and all of you can help
and continue to hire

232
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,623
our former employees.

233
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,502
Even as starlight scatters and glimmers,

234
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,742
the great Kunpeng may soar alone.

235
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,302
I've become the stars.

236
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,423
I hope you take care.

237
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,223
It seems like Madam He

238
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,262
has planned everyone's future beforehand.

239
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,903
I hope all of you can stand on your own

240
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,983
and don't let her hopes down.

241
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,822
I'm afraid what the letter said is...

242
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,240
As long as we don't see her body,

243
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
no one can know whether Mu Dan is really dead or not. Right?

244
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Yes.

245
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,262
Mu Dan is smart.

246
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,542
I'm sure she can think of a way to escape.

247
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,863
Then, we'll manage the shop well

248
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,623
and wait

249
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,360
until Mu Dan returns safely one day.

250
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,342
You are trapped in a cage

251
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,703
so you want everyone else to be trapped beside you.

252
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,983
How pathetic.

253
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,240
Why do you let yourself get hurt to this extent?

254
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,102
Chop off the limbs of the person who guards her.

255
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,479
Yes.

256
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Liu Chang!

257
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,703
You don't love yourself

258
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,943
so I have to ask my men to pay attention.

259
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,822
If you can't bear to see that,

260
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,640
just be obedient.

261
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,727
Eat.

262
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,143
Even if my Mu Dan has become a prisoner,

263
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,703
she will still look at me in this way.

264
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
There's still a long time to go.

265
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,262
I will make you come to
my side willingly one day.

266
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,582
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

267
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,560
I'll come and visit you again tomorrow.

268
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,640
Mu Dan!

269
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
Mu Dan.

270
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,703
You are the shop owner

271
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,903
of Blooming Abode and Wuyong Clinic.

272
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,302
Understanding all things

273
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,383
and changing the world is your dream.

274
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,623
You won't be trapped here forever.

275
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,943
You've become the moon now

276
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,822
as we watch each other from far away.

277
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,542
I can't touch you anymore.

278
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,822
Mu Dan.

279
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,143
No matter where the moon is,

280
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,502
the moonlight still exists everywhere.

281
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:05,086
You wanted to get rid of your boredom by making fragrances.

282
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,863
I asked my men to buy all the ingredients

283
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,383
yet you still won't talk to me.

284
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,423
This fragrance smells nice

285
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:30,903
and calms people down.

286
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,822
Does it have a name?

287
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
This fragrance...

288
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,062
You just won't let him go.

289
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,760
You too.

290
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,943
Your Highness, did you
come here to send me off?

291
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,560
I advise you

292
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,463
not to do anything recklessly.

293
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,183
You watched the person you love die before you.

294
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,663
You'll live in an endless hell forever.

295
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,022
He Wei Fang.

296
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,223
You finally experienced my pain.

297
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,143
I feel extremely sad for losing the person I love

298
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,463
but I won't give up.

299
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,582
Love is not the only thing in my life.

300
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,782
The purpose of my life

301
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,302
is not built on anyone.

302
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,102
Why must you trap
yourself in pain forever?

303
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,262
The Liu Chang you loved back then is already dead.

304
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,663
You should be concerned about yourself.

305
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,463
Instead of exchanging one life for another,

306
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,022
why not leave here alive?

307
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,423
No one is guarding this place now.

308
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,062
Why are you helping me?

309
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,782
Chang'an reeks of blood.

310
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,080
I don't like it.

311
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,236
Moreover, I've experienced

312
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,943
too many false affections in my life.

313
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,423
Even Father, who loves
me also sees me as a pawn.

314
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,582
I live as the princess

315
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,822
and die as the princess.

316
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,742
I will never escape from this cage.

317
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,143
Zi Shu was the only person

318
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,463
who gave me a pure heart.

319
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
I'm destined to be with him in my life.

320
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,839
I won't leave him until he dies.

321
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:03,880
Go.

322
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:25,952
Li You Zhen.

323
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,542
I've never believed in fate

324
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,822
so I will

325
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,623
always fight for myself at any time.

326
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,062
You can do the same as well.

327
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,782
Nothing is too late

328
00:32:39,464 --> 00:32:40,920
no matter when you begin.

329
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,943
Since you've let me go today,

330
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,223
I hope you will one day

331
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,742
let go of yourself as well.

332
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,223
Jiang Chang Yang has
been acting for so long.

333
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,639
The traitors he worked with will surely be more than

334
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,983
the ones found during the Shaowei Banquet.

335
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,703
Your Majesty,

336
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,463
if you can reveal a few of them,

337
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,262
the people on this
list can be spared.

338
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,423
They will only be banished.

339
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,903
I was not the only person

340
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,062
whom Sui Zhi protected with his life

341
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,782
but all the people who served the empire with their lives.

342
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,223
You won't kill all the loyal officials

343
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,502
and you failed

344
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,320
to force me to abdicate the throne.

345
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,880
What are you talking about, Your Majesty?

346
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,463
I'm just trying to share your burden.

347
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,663
You are still being patient

348
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,983
because you haven't made all the governors submit to you yet.

349
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,383
Let me guess.

350
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:05,582
Shuo Fang is close to you and he is near Hedong.

351
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,223
I'm sure he has submitted to you.

352
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,863
You allowed Xiao Xue Xi to leave the capital.

353
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,943
Does it mean you've struck a deal with Hexi?

354
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,423
Your Majesty, you're testing me

355
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,223
to see

356
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,222
which pawns I hold in my hands.

357
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,343
Actually,

358
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,263
the best pawn I have

359
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,903
is you, Your Majesty.

360
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,622
If you are in my hand,

361
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,757
The hero and traitor

362
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,622
will be determined by the decree issued in Chang'an.

363
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,542
So, please think twice

364
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,263
before you make a move,

365
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,983
Your Majesty.

366
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,680
Where is she?

367
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,943
Did you kill her?

368
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:27,423
You must dress your wound carefully.

369
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,983
Don't let it leave a scar.

370
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,903
I'm asking you if you killed her!

371
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:36,799
You told me

372
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,062
you would hate me forever

373
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,983
if I kill her.

374
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,542
I won't do something that foolish.

375
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,383
I only released her.

376
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,622
She will no longer come back.

377
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,599
It's time for you to let go as well.

378
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,863
I promised to treat you well.

379
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,423
Haven't I done that?

380
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:08,391
Li You Zhen,

381
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,182
why must you reveal everything?

382
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,502
Why can't you treat He Wei Fang as someone who is dead?

383
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,263
We can only be free

384
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,622
if she leaves.

385
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,343
Father is only a step away from becoming the emperor!

386
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,463
What you should do now is to aid him

387
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,863
and achieve your ambition.

388
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,062
There's no point

389
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,759
holding on to the person who won't stay.

390
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,199
Let's just live our lives well, all right?

391
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,823
You've made me stay forcefully

392
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,559
so how do you know that I can't make her stay?

393
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,159
Who are you? Stop!

394
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,542
Search carefully.

395
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,463
The hour of Hai!

396
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,239
Open the door!

397
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,800
Open the door! Hurry!

398
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:45,212
Open the door! Have you seen this person?

399
00:37:45,316 --> 00:37:47,600
- Search! - Those at the back, go there!

400
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:52,054
Come here.

401
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,542
Have you seen this woman?

402
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,702
My Lord, you are...

403
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,519
Check over there! Quickly!

404
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,919
Stop!

405
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:24,158
Who are you?

406
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Stop!

407
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,303
Search carefully!

408
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:42,800
- How is it? - She's not here.

409
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,320
She's not here.

410
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:46,720
She's not here.

411
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,783
I saw her run inside here.

412
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,222
Search thoroughly!

413
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,102
Sir, there's a piece of broken cloth here!

414
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,360
I'm sure she climbed out from here.

415
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,879
After her!

416
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,142
Huanyun Pavilion has long been seized.

417
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,142
There has been no one guarding the place.

418
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,662
My Mu Dan is really smart.

419
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,159
You made me look for you for so long.

420
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,463
Unfortunately, you still can't escape my grasp

421
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,743
no matter how smart you are.

422
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
Be obedient

423
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,720
and stop causing trouble.

424
00:40:56,222 --> 00:40:57,238
Come back with me.

425
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,102
How do you know
that I'm hiding here

426
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,263
instead of making you step into a trap?

427
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,463
If the Princess hadn't stopped me,

428
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,423
I would've taken your life.

429
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,343
Since you don't cherish your chance,

430
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,182
I'll kill you today to
accompany Sui Zhi.

431
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:23,600
It's the same.

432
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,823
How can you

433
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,783
kill me on your own?

434
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,799
Sui Zhi's shadow guards are located all around the city.

435
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,582
I've met with them earlier.

436
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,102
A few crossbows

437
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,823
are aiming at this place
outside the windows.

438
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,983
If I smash this jar of wine,

439
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,359
tens of thousands of arrows will shoot in

440
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
from the windows.
