00:01:30,784 --> 00:01:38,000
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,760
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,240
(Fang Garden)

4
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,240
Madam He.

5
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,103
I've been irresponsible.

6
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,272
Yet all of you stayed loyal and stood by me despite my faults.

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,160
I'm very grateful.

8
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,962
I will never let you down again.

9
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,660
The contracts for Blooming Abode and Qingshu Pavilion,

10
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,395
along with the pawnshop pledges, are here, untouched.

11
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,183
Xiao Chun, Da Fu, and I have talked about it.

12
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,543
Mu Dan, you're still our shop owner.

13
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,542
I've returned from my journey a changed person.

14
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,343
I promise I will lead us all to greater success in this business.

15
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,902
Yes! Yes!

16
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,435
I've been through hard times, just like you.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,184
I can only stand here today

18
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,159
because of the kindness from others.

19
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,481
Now that things are finally looking up for us,

20
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:22,304
I, He Wei Fang, don't want to live a life that's aimless.

21
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,464
I want to live up to the honor granted by His Majesty.

22
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,143
Whether you're a woman,

23
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,064
a craftsman, or a merchant,

24
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,663
by helping the people in need and serving your country,

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,024
you honor your years and embody the nation's splendor.

26
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:40,423
I see you as my family.

27
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,344
I'd like to tell you

28
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,583
that my aspirations have changed.

29
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,081
I ask your support to walk this path together.

30
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,504
But we're humble people with nothing to our names.

31
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:54,057
How can we serve the nation?

32
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,244
Our flowers can be used as medicine.

33
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:58,344
The money we earn can help the poor.

34
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,200
No act of kindness is ever too small.

35
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,583
Every act of kindness adds up.

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,186
And that's how we serve our nation.

37
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,943
Mu Dan, you're our employer.

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,744
You don't owe us an explanation for anything.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,344
Yet you treat us like family by sharing your mind.

40
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,560
Of course we'll follow you.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,921
All our businesses will continue operating as usual.

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,998
All charitable expenses will come from my personal accounts.

43
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:23,383
Your monthly pay will not be reduced.

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,823
When our new ventures begin,

45
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,184
you will be fairly compensated for your work.

46
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:33,104
I trust you won't shortchange us.

47
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,678
You've been through a lot to get to where you are today.

48
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,624
Are you really going to spend your hard-earned wealth helping others?

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,343
I hate seeing you sacrifice your comfort for noble ideals.

50
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,104
It's not practical.

51
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:46,823
I'm no saint.

52
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,783
I'm not doing all this just for others.

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,544
Madam, your family used to own farmlands,

54
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,309
until corrupt officials took it from you.

55
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,918
You and your son ended up as servants

56
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,143
for wealthy merchants and officials.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,903
When he accidentally broke the county magistrate's porcelain,

58
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,223
they falsely accused him of theft

59
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,864
because he couldn't pay for it.

60
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,903
You have been separated ever since,

61
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,944
all because corrupt officials rule unchecked.

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Everyone,

63
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:21,397
only when the society becomes a better place

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,583
can our lives improve.

65
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,279
Only then will people finally have the leisurely mood

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,485
to enjoy something as simple and beautiful

67
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,023
as peonies here in our garden.

68
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,081
I understand now.

69
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,223
I will join your cause.

70
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,583
When the world changes for the better,

71
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,544
my son will come home.

72
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,104
I will join your cause too.

73
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,561
- Me too.   - Me as well.

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Thank you.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,500
How is the search for the new shop location going?

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,463
We've chosen a spot in the West Market.

77
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:01,903
Are you certain about this?

78
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:05,343
Chang'an has no shortage of clinics and apothecaries.

79
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,823
How will yours compete?

80
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,617
Medical treatment is too costly for common people these days.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,744
They can afford the consultation but not the medicines.

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,383
After researching ancient formulas,

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,664
Xiao Chun and I have found affordable herbs

84
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:23,240
with equal efficacy and created new prescriptions.

85
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,326
We'll also provide free consultation every ten days.

86
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,424
Medicines will be sold at cost price.

87
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:32,823
And those who still can't afford them may buy on credit.

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,223
Herb cultivation, transport,

89
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,424
storage and sale

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,343
differ greatly from flower trade.

91
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,823
Your expenses in Sheng County aren't trivial either.

92
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,433
Are you sure you have enough capital?

93
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,624
Are you offering to invest?

94
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:52,064
Such public welfare deserves my contribution.

95
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,463
How could I use others' money for charity?

96
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:00,918
Don't worry, my business is bringing in plenty now,

97
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,113
more than enough to support this.

98
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,944
Besides, commerce is my expertise.

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,903
You should save your resources for the court.

100
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,383
San Lang will need funds for his cause.

101
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:12,321
Alright.

102
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:24,783
About Sheng County,

103
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,544
relying solely on herbs gathered from the mountains isn't sustainable.

104
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,583
Do you have other plans?

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,038
When I left Sheng County,

106
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,944
I brought several competent villagers with me

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,823
and taught them herb cultivation.

108
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Beyond medicinal plants,

109
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
we're also growing sesame and rapeseed,

110
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,864
which are useful in medicine and can also be used in food.

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,624
People in Chang'an love sesame flatbreads.

112
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,913
Sprinkling sesame seeds will enhance the flavor.

113
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,546
We'll have no trouble finding buyers.

114
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,263
You're just craving those flatbreads yourself.

115
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,783
That's self-serving.

116
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,304
Don't pretend you don't love them.

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,397
You drown your lamb soup with multiple flatbreads every time!

118
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,544
So you're not much better.

119
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:07,583
Young, able-bodied men can do more than just farm or grow herbs,

120
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,023
they can transport goods too.

121
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,023
I've repurposed several vacant buildings

122
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,343
into workshops for women.

123
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:17,424
Xiao Chun, Madam Sun, Man, and I

124
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,583
have been teaching them the craft ourselves.

125
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,624
See, we have to scrape it into something like this.

126
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,184
Rotate it like this.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,064
Put a little force into it.

128
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,143
This part here is too tight.

129
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,503
You can loosen it a little here.

130
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:37,064
Are you planning to open a clinic in Sheng County too?

131
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:38,776
Of course.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,000
It's hard enough for the poor to see a physician.

133
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,583
Without local doctors,

134
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,264
they'd have to travel to Chang'an.

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,757
The journey alone is exhausting.

136
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,184
Even if they manage to make it here,

137
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,999
the food and lodging costs become another heavy burden.

138
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,921
But skilled physicians rarely want to work in remote areas.

139
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,863
Who would staff this clinic?

140
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,520
I'll recruit two apprentice physicians,

141
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,863
like Xiao Chun, who devote themselves to healing people.

142
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,983
It'll give them a chance to hone their skills and,

143
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,983
at the same time, help those in need.

144
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,743
Of course, this arrangement is only suitable for minor illnesses.

145
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,664
For complex cases,

146
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,037
my merchant convoy keeps fast horses ready

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,703
to bring Xiao Chun there for consultations.

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,184
You've thought of everything.

149
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,037
The clinic in Sheng County will offer free consultations.

150
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,446
We'll only charge for the medicine.

151
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,823
And if someone can't afford that,

152
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,343
their family or the patient themselves, once they recover,

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,144
can repay through labor.

154
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,144
But how can you tell

155
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,983
if someone is really poor or just trying to take advantage?

156
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,280
I've asked Magistrate Yu to draft

157
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,277
a list of verified impoverished households.

158
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,863
It'll be easy to tell who's being honest.

159
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,703
Since the consultation is free,

160
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:58,544
haven't you considered waiving the medicine fees too?

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,426
A little help earns you gratitude. Give too much, it breeds resentment.

162
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:08,103
If kindness turns into blind generosity,

163
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,223
all it does is feed greed.

164
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:14,024
Besides, sustainable benevolence requires careful stewardship.

165
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,944
Complete free service would bankrupt us, and it won't last.

166
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,740
More importantly, if I give away everything for free,

167
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,757
I'll be breaking the rules of the trade.

168
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,160
That'll just stir up trouble in the long run.

169
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:30,304
Your wisdom puts my worries to rest.

170
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,264
It's a pity San Lang isn't here.

171
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,784
He'd be so proud if he could hear you.

172
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,583
He'd probably eat two extra bowls of rice from joy.

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Don't worry.

174
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,463
As long as it's within my power, I'll do everything I can.

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,103
As for the court, that's your and His Majesty's domain.

176
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,064
May you purge the corrupt

177
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,503
and reform cruel policies soon.

178
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:19,921
This way, please.

179
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,784
Here's your prescription.

180
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:24,223
Let your child take the medicine on time, and he'll recover.

181
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,401
Thank you, physician.

182
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,040
- Please get up.   -  Madam He.

183
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
The village chief from Sheng County is waiting outside.

184
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,863
- Alright. Please take over.   - Thank you, physician.

185
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Careful.

186
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:37,961
Next.

187
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:40,321
Easy.

188
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:45,703
- Mu Dan!   - Zhao!

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Madam.

190
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Chief.

191
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,561
Come on.

192
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Zhao.

193
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:56,184
Mu Dan, the sachets Mother made sold for a lot of money!

194
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:59,904
She said I could buy two packs of maltose candy in the city today.

195
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,439
Of course you can.

196
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,078
I'll even give you extra packs.

197
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,161
Take them back to the village and share them with your friends.

198
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:07,304
Thank you, Mu Dan.

199
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Thank you for your hard work.

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,863
Mu Dan, what is the name of your shop?

201
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:16,743
Look, Zhao, it's called

202
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,384
Wuyong Clinic.

203
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:21,757
Wuyong Clinic?

204
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,184
What does it mean?

205
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,041
It means

206
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,664
understanding the way of all things, spreading kindness,

207
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,503
and embracing the wisdom of balance.

208
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:32,463
What's "balance"?

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,144
And why do we need to understand it?

210
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,304
Pay close attention when village school begins.

211
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,437
When the rapeseed flowers bloom,

212
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,304
the teacher will begin that lesson.

213
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,304
Then you'll understand

214
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,743
what it means.

215
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,041
General Xiao.

216
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:57,441
Please come in.

217
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,281
Father.

218
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,983
I shall not intrude upon your family conversation.

219
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,201
Please excuse me.

220
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,544
If I hadn't come in person,

221
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,331
you'd still be enjoying yourself here,

222
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,933
forgetting all about your home in Hexi.

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,863
That's not true.

224
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,623
I've missed you all terribly.

225
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,223
I do want to come home,

226
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:55,921
it's just

227
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,983
that arranged marriage...

228
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,103
I've talked to King Ning about it.

229
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,983
The engagement is canceled.

230
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,463
You may choose

231
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,184
whom you wish to marry now.

232
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,144
But King Ning won't let me go so easily.

233
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,944
What did you promise him in return?

234
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,304
Court matters are not your concern.

235
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,944
I will protect you

236
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,904
and our family.

237
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:35,801
I won!

238
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:37,463
Hand over Solitary Orchid now.

239
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,664
I thought you'd give her something different.

240
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,144
Peonies again? Really?

241
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,720
You lost, just admit it. Don't drag me into it.

242
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,343
She's leaving soon,

243
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,840
and you won't even give her a music score? Stingy!

244
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:54,264
Xue Xi, my parting gift

245
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,681
is more than just flowers.

246
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:58,561
What do you mean?

247
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,544
The first time we met,

248
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,703
you showed up like a deity sent from heaven and saved my life.

249
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,184
I will never forget

250
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,223
that moment.

251
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,863
This is the most thoughtful gift.

252
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,041
I love it.

253
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm glad.

254
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,863
Well then, maybe I didn't really lose after all.

255
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,277
When you find your true match,

256
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
on your wedding day,

257
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:42,664
I'll present Solitary Orchid as your wedding gift.

258
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:49,424
Meeting you both has been my greatest fortune.

259
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,304
Thank you for your companionship and your help.

260
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,983
Though we part today, I believe we shall meet again.

261
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,823
We will meet again.

262
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,503
Confucius said,

263
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,503
"A noble person seeks not satiety in eating,

264
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,944
nor comfort in dwelling.

265
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,503
Quick in action yet cautious in speech,

266
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,863
He rectifies himself by aligning with the virtuous.

267
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,904
Such may truly be called devoted to learning."

268
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:39,201
Madam He.

269
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:43,281
- Madam He.   - Don't mind me.

270
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Alright.

271
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:55,880
So? What do you think?

272
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,904
The place is thriving. Full of life and energy.

273
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,086
It's hard to believe this is the same Sheng County I visited last time.

274
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:06,144
You've always wanted to contribute to Wuyong Clinic, haven't you?

275
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,023
Well, there's a rather challenging task at hand.

276
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,104
After careful consideration,

277
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,346
I can think of no one better suited than you.

278
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:19,543
- What is it?   - Medicine testing. Do you dare to try it?

279
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,424
Any remedy you and Xiao Chun develop,

280
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:23,681
I'd trust implicitly.

281
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,503
- Give it to me.   - That's just perfect!

282
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:31,601
Get up.

283
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,263
Take off your clothes.

284
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,641
What do you mean?

285
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,881
What do I mean?

286
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,424
To test wound ointment, we need to apply it to actual wounds.

287
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:44,983
With all your old injuries,

288
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:47,824
you're perfect for comparing which formula works best.

289
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:51,826
Just give me the medicine. I'll try it at home

290
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,584
and report back in a few days.

291
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,023
Wuyong Clinic has this rule.

292
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,384
Medicine trials must be supervised by either Xiao Chun or myself.

293
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:02,664
If something goes wrong, we can treat it immediately.

294
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:08,210
Come on, I saw everything

295
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,273
when you were unconscious from injuries.

296
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,841
What's wrong?

297
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:14,783
Don't tell me you're shy.

298
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:17,997
I'm the great Flower Bird Envoy, who's surrounded by beauties.

299
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,144
I never get shy.

300
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:20,921
Perfect!

301
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:23,104
As healers, we see beyond gender anyway.

302
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,433
I'll gratefully trust you with this task then.

303
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Fine.

304
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,303
This ointment can fade scars.

305
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,144
Even old ones will lighten significantly.

306
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,361
Alright.

307
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,201
Jiang Chang Yang.

308
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,703
I can keep myself safe.

309
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:13,601
You don't have to

310
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:15,944
risk your life for me anymore.

311
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,783
Your cheeks are red.

312
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,664
The ointment on my chest feels a little warm.

313
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:45,783
That's just the turmeric in the formula.

314
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:47,881
You'll be fine.

315
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,783
When you gave me that jade comb,

316
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,733
you said it was to ease my weariness.

317
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,104
You said brushing my hair would help me relax.

318
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:01,944
But haven't you been just as exhausted?

319
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,824
As Flower Bird Envoy,

320
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,824
you always have to wear a mask out in the world.

321
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,760
But when you're home, you can take it off.

322
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Jiang Chang Yang.

323
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,344
When you're with me,

324
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,023
you don't need to pretend.

325
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
I'm not pretending.

326
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,904
I've always been at ease

327
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,184
when I'm with you.

328
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,184
That night you lay unconscious from your wounds,

329
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,503
you dreamed of a woman.

330
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:43,983
Do you remember?

331
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:50,161
Did I?

332
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,904
Did I say anything ridiculous?

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Not really.

334
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,703
You just held onto her tightly

335
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:01,601
and asked her not to go.

336
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,144
I just remembered.

337
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,303
San Lang and I are meeting up later.

338
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,223
I should get back to Chang'an now.

339
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:28,303
I'm so happy today. Let's drink more.

340
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
It's empty.

341
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
There's more here.

342
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:42,503
"Whoever marries first is a dog."

343
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,121
Mu Dan.

344
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,303
Before I go,

345
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,184
I have a gift for you too.

346
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,624
On Lantern Festival night,

347
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,793
Sui Zhi was going to confess his feelings to the one he loved

348
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:08,144
under the full moon.

349
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,144
But

350
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,144
when she was wounded protecting him,

351
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,503
his guilt silenced what should have been spoken.

352
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,944
When I wanted to restore the Lishan Palace,

353
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,146
the Ministry of Revenue said we had no money for it.

354
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,630
Turns out all the money had gone into Zheng Shou De's pockets!

355
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,424
Investigation revealed he pocketed 500,000 taels.

356
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,664
Who knows

357
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:55,983
how much more is hidden?

358
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,104
Apparently, the imperial treasury doesn't belong me,

359
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:04,584
it belongs to him!

360
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,223
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

361
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
Your Majesty,

362
00:23:14,513 --> 00:23:16,006
having served long in Ministry of Revenue,

363
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,980
I know every layer of taxation inside and out.

364
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,080
From local governors all the way up

365
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,318
to the clerks, vice ministers, and ministers in Chang'an,

366
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,743
every level takes a cut,

367
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,624
until only 30 percent of the tax actually reaches the treasury.

368
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:30,881
I managed to obtain the real ledger books,

369
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,677
but even after searching Zheng Residence,

370
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,344
500,000 taels are still missing.

371
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,278
Your Majesty, corruption in the Ministry of Revenue is a festering wound.

372
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:44,703
I urge you to investigate every official in the department.

373
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:47,358
Zheng Shou De dared to make fake ledgers

374
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,303
soon after he took office as the minister.

375
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,323
It's obvious that he had powerful backing.

376
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,118
There are rumors he was recommended by King Ning,

377
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,677
and they are known to be quite close.

378
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,783
Like you said,

379
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,866
Zheng Shou De was only recently transferred back to Chang'an.

380
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:02,944
Occasional visits with His Highness mean nothing!

381
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:07,104
Censor-in-Chief, how dare you slander His Lordship without proof!

382
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Your Majesty,

383
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,717
I've always sought out talented men from across the land,

384
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,424
recommending them regardless of background,

385
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,184
only ever with the hope of serving the nation and people.

386
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,543
I never imagined

387
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:32,263
Zheng Shou De would betray my trust and deceive you.

388
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,063
I'm devastated.

389
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,983
I fully accept responsibility for failing to see through him.

390
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:41,240
Please punish me as you see fit, Your Majesty.

391
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Brother,

392
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:45,624
I have never

393
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:47,743
doubted your loyalty.

394
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:49,401
Your Majesty,

395
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:51,104
family ties are important,

396
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:54,104
but you are the ruler of all the people!

397
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:56,384
Your overleniency

398
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,584
would harm the entire nation!

399
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,223
Your Majesty!

400
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:04,681
Your Majesty!

401
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:11,904
Vice Minister Lu may be too focused on blame rather than results.

402
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,717
While factionalism must be investigated,

403
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,104
recovering the money is paramount.

404
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,001
Natural disasters have devastated many regions;

405
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,624
the situation is dire.

406
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,864
The country comes first.

407
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:24,783
Your Majesty, if you trust me,

408
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,664
I vow to uncover the missing money

409
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,144
and resolve this case in three days.

410
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,543
If I fail,

411
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,384
I shall reimburse

412
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,944
the imperial treasury myself,

413
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,864
even if it may cost me everything.

414
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,121
My Lord!

415
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,184
I drank too much last night.

416
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,641
I arrived too late

417
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:03,384
and missed my chance to chastise those insolent officials for you.

418
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,303
I heard what happened.

419
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:09,303
500,000 taels is no trifling sum.

420
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,121
It'd be a shame to hand it to the treasury just like that.

421
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
If I may suggest,

422
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,600
you could toss a few low-ranking officials under the cart,

423
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,543
let them scrape the money together instead.

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,783
At Zheng Shou De's birthday banquet, the night those ledgers went missing,

425
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,864
I heard you were also quite drunk,

426
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:30,104
and left the gathering early.

427
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,184
My Lord, you know me.

428
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:35,104
I've always lacked restraint with wine.

429
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,983
Lu Chu used to be meek and cautious, always the quiet one.

430
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,344
Why does he grow bold coincidentally with Zheng Shou De's arrival?

431
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,520
He is the Commissioner of Transport now, yet he isn't satisfied.

432
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,944
He even challenged His Lordship in court.

433
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,144
I wonder who empowered him.

434
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,824
And you, usually indulging yourself in leisure stuff,

435
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,983
if you too were to change suddenly...

436
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,344
I was concerned for His Lordship.

437
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,824
I rushed here to offer help and advice.

438
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,120
You, on the other hand, hold no official post right now.

439
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,864
You can't be of real use to His Lordship,

440
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,624
so you've got nothing better to do than sow discord.

441
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,693
Or is this about your lingering obsession

442
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,543
for Mu Dan?

443
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:14,809
Sui Zhi.

444
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,743
All else aside,

445
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,033
I clearly remember

446
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:23,144
your tolerance for alcohol is impressive.

447
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,023
Yet you seemed to

448
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,593
get drunk a little too quickly that night.

449
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,184
Lapdog.

450
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,040
(Fang Garden)

451
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:05,961
Mu Dan.

452
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,063
Xiao Chun and I have been working on a new formula.

453
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,321
It boosts yang energy, dispels chill, and even aids sleep.

454
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,864
It's been selling well this month. Would you like to try it?

455
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,344
Really?

456
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,637
Do you think I've worn myself out with all my late-night drinking

457
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
and pleasure-seeking,

458
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:30,144
and now you want to replenish my strength?

459
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:32,921
Precisely.

460
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,878
Your vigor

461
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,201
benefits me both.

462
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,841
Come with me.

463
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,023
Jiang Chang Yang, why do you have that rouge stain on your collar?

464
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
I probably brushed up against someone's rouge by accident.

465
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,318
You're overreacting.

466
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,401
Let me see it.

467
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:56,904
Don't lie to me!

468
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,963
You said you were out drinking with Tang Si Lang last night.

469
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,233
So where did this rouge come from?

470
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:03,790
- Where?   - He brought a courtesan along.

471
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,080
She got drunk and stumbled into me.

472
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,161
Stand still!

473
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:08,904
When you married me, you made me promise!

474
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,197
And now you're squandering my earnings

475
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,743
to wine and dine other women,

476
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,543
leaving me alone at home!

477
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,944
- Jiang Chang Yang!   - My dear, you're being dramatic now.

478
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:18,703
I'll apologize, alright?

479
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,063
Tonight, I'm all yours.

480
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,520
Please don't be mad.

481
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:25,401
Not that one.

482
00:29:34,121 --> 00:29:35,944
He's gone, Young Master.

483
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,303
They even climbed up there.

484
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,223
Wow, they're good.

485
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,526
You really are worthy of the title Flower Bird Envoy.

486
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,864
Of all the things to pick,

487
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,783
you just picked the most expensive one to smash.

488
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,503
With your business thriving these days,

489
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:56,293
surely you can afford to buy more items like that.

490
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:01,080
Show me our contract. How were the profits divided again?

491
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,824
They are even watching me now.

492
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
What happened?

493
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,201
We exposed the Ministry of Revenue's corruption.

494
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:22,263
After stirring up so much trouble,

495
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:23,940
King Ning has grown more suspicious of me.

496
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,813
There were two copies of this contract.

497
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,063
I burned mine before I came.

498
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,063
You're worried if King Ning moves against you,

499
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:38,543
I'll be implicated.

500
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:42,864
Your businesses thrived

501
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,423
without my help.

502
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:46,558
After collecting profits off them for so long,

503
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:47,904
I've made back everything I put in.

504
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,023
Now you've got Wuyong Clinic to manage too,

505
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,263
and that'll need a lot of money.

506
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:56,144
You'll have more room to thrive

507
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,624
without a debt collector like me.

508
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
This is good for you too.

509
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,783
Business is good, after all.

510
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:06,184
If something

511
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:08,104
ever happens to you,

512
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,046
at least I'll still have the funds to pull some strings for you.

513
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,063
As for the shop where you invested,

514
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:18,503
I'll save up every coin of your share.

515
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:22,023
Contracts never bound us anyway.

516
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:30,824
I know you're loyal,

517
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:33,424
- still...   - I'm not doing this just for you.

518
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,983
I want San Lang to win.

519
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:48,881
Alright.

520
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Jiang Chang Yang,

521
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:02,223
please be careful.

522
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:07,384
Hearing what you just say,

523
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:09,703
I feel more at ease now.

524
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,624
If things go badly,

525
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:16,344
best case, I have you to support me for life.

526
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,344
Worst case, I have you to hold me a funeral.

527
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:21,361
Thank you.

528
00:32:41,813 --> 00:32:43,917
Vice Minister, this list of yours

529
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,223
has left me a little confused.

530
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,758
My Lord, these are all officials who bribed Zheng Shou De.

531
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:55,384
We have solid evidence they're accomplices.

532
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,503
Sacrificing these minor pawns

533
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,063
won't hinder your control of the court.

534
00:33:08,201 --> 00:33:10,944
Vice Minister, you and I rarely cross paths.

535
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:13,983
Yet today, you come offering advice,

536
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,384
what should I give you in return?

537
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,463
Zheng Shou De is gone.

538
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,824
Surely you won't let let that ungrateful Lu Chu

539
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,983
claim the Minister's seat, would you?

540
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:31,358
My Lord, I've long admired you.

541
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:34,944
Now is the perfect moment for me to prove my loyalty

542
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,263
to you and the court.

543
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,503
Please grant me your favor, My Lord.

544
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,703
Zhangchou, your eagerness to earn merit

545
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,624
has clouded your judgment.

546
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
If His Lordship sacrifices

547
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,983
so many loyal men just for the money,

548
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
wouldn't his other men

549
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:03,121
feel disheartened?

550
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,344
I really don't know

551
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,623
how else I could scrape together the money.

552
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,904
Zi Shu, with your clever mind,

553
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:18,264
do you have any suggestion for me?

554
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,623
I do, actually.

555
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:29,103
The only question is, will you dare to carry it out?

556
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:39,864
I'd do anything for His Lordship!

557
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:44,824
My Lord, are you certain about this plan?

558
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,384
Zhangchou Feng has left King Ning's residence.

559
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,424
We have no other choice now.

560
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,864
I'm leaving it to you and Miss Yun.

561
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,801
Yes, sir.

562
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,264
Make sure Mu Dan's shop is busier than ever tomorrow.

563
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,704
She mustn't get involved.

564
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Yes, sir.

565
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,944
- Please come in.   - First come, first served!

566
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Please take care.

567
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,801
The medicine, please. Pass the prescription to Madam.

568
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:12,881
Why are all the follow-up patients crowding in today?

569
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,718
Madam, there's nothing seriously wrong.

570
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:17,744
Just finish these remedies, and you'll get better. Here.

571
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,361
- Goodbye.   - Thank you, Madam He.

572
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,841
Miss, are you alright?

573
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
Next.

574
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Lian Zhou?

575
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,784
Pei Zhong may look gentle and refined,

576
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,904
but behind closed doors, he's cruel and violent.

577
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,904
In bedchamber...

578
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,344
He likes to use a whip.

579
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,623
You've got old wounds layered over fresh ones.

580
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:53,824
If those cuts fester and become infected, you could die.

581
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,304
Can you tell him to let you rest and recuperate for a month?

582
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,904
I'm just a gift.

583
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,543
And a gift has no right

584
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,264
to say no.

585
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Mu Dan,

586
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,344
I made the wrong choice.

587
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,783
I should've taken your advice

588
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,623
and left Chang'an.

589
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Lian Zhou,

590
00:36:31,961 --> 00:36:33,183
if you want,

591
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
it's not too late.

592
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,503
I can help you escape the Pei family.

593
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
Mu Dan...

594
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,623
Mix poinsettia and daffodil sap together,

595
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,103
it'll cause a rash that looks like a skin infection.

596
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:52,103
When the sores appear, I'll have Xiao Chun come treat you.

597
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:53,784
We'll say you've come down with smallpox.

598
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,784
Knowing Pei Zhong's nature,

599
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,663
he won't care if you live or die.

600
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,663
But to avoid contagion,

601
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,864
he will throw you out.

602
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:03,441
And then,

603
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,224
you'll be free.

604
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,321
I'll never forget your kindness for as long as I live!

605
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:11,480
Lian Zhou, please get up.

606
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,921
Easy there.

607
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:14,361
Careful.

608
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,784
Starting over won't be easy.

609
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:24,944
But remember this,

610
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:27,463
no matter what happens,

611
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,583
you must cherish yourself.

612
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,304
No one is worth lowering yourself for.

613
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,103
When I was little, I had my parents to protect me.

614
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,503
After they were gone,

615
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,063
I kept looking for shelter

616
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,904
from one man to the next.

617
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:49,623
Somewhere along the way...

618
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:54,103
I think I forgot what freedom feels like.

619
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Can I...

620
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,864
Can I really do it?

621
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,120
Of course you can.

622
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:06,084
You're clever, capable, and you understand people well.

623
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,183
You're skilled in embroidery,

624
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,526
and you know a great deal about women's fashions.

625
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:14,983
One day, you could open your own dress shop.

626
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:16,543
I'm sure it would thrive.

627
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,944
Do you know Wuyong Clinic opened a branch in Sheng County?

628
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,238
The women there may not know how to read,

629
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:26,224
but they manage to make a living with their hands.

630
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,744
If they can do it, so can you.

631
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:30,543
You don't need a man to live a good life.

632
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,424
Xiao Chun is right.

633
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:35,401
Lian Zhou,

634
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,543
we'll prepare the toxic sap immediately.

635
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:41,466
We'll send it to the Pei Residence three days later.

636
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Alright.

637
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:50,881
Mu Dan,

638
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
you should leave

639
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,143
Jiang Chang Yang while you still can.

640
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,904
King Ning is going after him.

641
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:58,944
Don't let yourself get dragged down with him.

642
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,183
What is King Ning going to do to Jiang Chang Yang?

643
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:04,504
According to Pei Zhong,

644
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,704
King Ning intends to pin the corruption

645
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:08,944
on Jiang Chang Yang.

646
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,784
He is going to seize his assets to cover the Ministry's missing funds.

647
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:15,361
He might

648
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,784
execute him as well...

649
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,304
To calm public outrage.

650
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Zhangchou...

651
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,063
I have to carry out my duty.

652
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,143
- Traitor to the nation!   - Look at that gold brick!

653
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:53,920
- Seize him.   - A corrupt official!

654
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,253
That's the people's money!

655
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,640
- Keep searching!   - Yes, sir!

656
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Search the place!

657
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:08,801
Move!

658
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,561
Get out of the way!

659
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,878
Officer, you can't enter!

660
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:13,440
Move! Search the place!

661
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,638
Officer!

662
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:15,721
Move!

663
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,600
- He stole people's money.   - A corrupt man!

664
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,841
- That's a lot!   - He's unbelievably greedy!

665
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,957
How much do you think that is?

666
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,864
He's rotten to the core!

667
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,080
Excuse me, please let me through.

668
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:35,281
- Please let me through.   - Stop.

669
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:36,503
A shameless, thieving official!

670
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
A thieving official.

671
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,463
He's coming out! The thief is out!

672
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:57,198
Heaven's justice at last!

673
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,384
How much of the people's blood and sweat have you stolen?

674
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,143
Get him!

675
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,040
Get him!

676
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
What are you doing here?

677
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:11,401
I didn't want you to see me like this.

678
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,023
Jiang Chang Yang, listen to me,

679
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:15,344
from the moment we signed that first contract,

680
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,264
I've been in this with you, all the way.

681
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,744
No matter what happens,

682
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,304
we're facing it together.
