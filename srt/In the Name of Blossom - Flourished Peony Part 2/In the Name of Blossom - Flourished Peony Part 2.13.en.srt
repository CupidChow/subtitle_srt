00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:38,120
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,082
(Episode 13)

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,062
Mu Dan, what's wrong?
Did you cut your hand?

4
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:08,762
Let me take a look.

5
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,558
I'm okay. It'll be fine after a while.

6
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,737
Are you carving the
auspicious cloud design?

7
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,404
It's very exquisite.

8
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,043
It still needs a little more work.

9
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,103
Once it's done,

10
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,383
we can imprint it on the scented
pouch we sell during festive occasions

11
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,026
as a sign of good luck.

12
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,543
I never knew that you could carve seals.

13
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,343
Mother taught me how to do it.

14
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,380
Mu Dan,

15
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,223
thanks to you, Fang
Garden's business is booming.

16
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,759
I'm sure Madam He will be proud of you

17
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,462
if she can see you from above.

18
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,063
How can I meet my mother's expectation

19
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,783
without killing her murderer myself?

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,430
Jiang Chang Yang came to
Fang Garden to look for you today.

21
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,503
Liu Lang said you were in a bad
mood and that you didn't want to see him.

22
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,871
He chased him away.

23
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,783
Initially,

24
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:21,042
I thought I knew him well enough
after spending some time with him.

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,862
I knew about his ties with Mr. Wu.

26
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,045
But I didn't expect him
to defend a murderer

27
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,164
when the truth was clearly obvious.

28
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,233
I couldn't understand why.

29
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,503
I was surprised by what he did as well.

30
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,702
I suppose he's someone who
covers up for someone's faults.

31
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,223
He was nice to us before this.

32
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:53,462
After some time had passed, we
forgot that he was the Flower Bird Envoy.

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,983
He was a notorious official
who was known for his corruption.

34
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,552
I did forget about something.

35
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,182
Staging an act is his expertise.

36
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,689
Just let bygones be bygones.

37
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,022
Mr. Wu is pitiful too.

38
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:13,417
Mu Dan,

39
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,283
you should let it go.

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,583
All these years, Mr. Wu
had led an impoverished life.

41
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,536
He has always been atoning for his sin.

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,560
- Madam He...   - Mr. Wu.

43
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,360
Say no more.

44
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,503
It wasn't just Jiang Chang Yang.

45
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,983
Why was Mr. Wu calm and
composed when he met me?

46
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,502
It was as if he predicted
that I would look for him.

47
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,813
And Mother,

48
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,460
why has she never mentioned
this matter to me before?

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,863
The symptoms of poison and
contracting a disease are vastly different.

50
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,633
A physician can only cure the patient
if they're honest with the diagnosis.

51
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,275
Back then, during the diagnosis,

52
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,822
Mother kept sending me away.

53
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,711
This won't do.

54
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,062
I must find out the truth.

55
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,500
Mu Dan!

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,680
I've investigated the things
you wanted me to investigate.

57
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,732
Mr. Wu has been in the orphans' sick house

58
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,349
after returning to Chang'an from Luoyang.

59
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,302
He only spends time with the orphans.

60
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,703
Now, he has no family or relatives left.

61
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,081
What is this?

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,942
These are the names and ages
of all the children in the house.

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,062
For a couple of them, I
only know their nicknames.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,103
I need to ask the surrounding
villagers about their true names.

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,583
Why did you investigate their background?

66
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,094
I wish to know

67
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,232
if any of them came from Luoyang.

68
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,693
Kang!

69
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,079
Kang?

70
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,997
Kang loves to play around here usually.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,422
Why isn't he here today?

72
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,996
- Stop right there!   - Is that Kang?

73
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,667
Stop right there?

74
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,942
Where did it hit
you? Does it hurt?

75
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,728
- I'm fine.   - Let me go!

76
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,885
Come here!

77
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,357
- Let me go!   - It's Kang indeed.

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,477
Let me go!

79
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,717
That was a sneak attack!
That was not chivalrous at all!

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,981
- Let me go!   - Don't move!

81
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,788
Stand here!

82
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,679
- Give it back!   - No, I won't.

83
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,106
Give it back!

84
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,150
Kang, let me ask you something.

85
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,023
Usually, you were the
most obedient boy around.

86
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,439
Why did you hurt me today?

87
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,663
It was quite painful too.

88
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,543
To think that Mu Dan always
delivered clothing and food to you all.

89
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,103
You're such an ingrate.

90
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,571
You're a crook!

91
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,278
I don't want your stuff!

92
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,957
Let go!

93
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,143
Why are you saying that?

94
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,402
You were going to harm Mr. Wu!

95
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,992
I saw it myself.

96
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,663
You're just a villain!

97
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,262
How would you know
that Mr. Wu wasn't a villain?

98
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,382
Mr. Wu is the kindest person I've ever met!

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,663
He's my savior!

100
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,582
Calm down.

101
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:17,054
You have tuberculosis. Slow down.

102
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,632
Have some water. Here.

103
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,663
What are you doing?
I don't want your stuff.

104
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,502
I would've been dead during
the flood without Mr. Wu!

105
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,103
If you try to harm him, that
means you're my enemy!

106
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,081
Kang, let me ask you this.

107
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:37,247
Were you referring to the flood that
occurred in Luoyang four years ago?

108
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,742
Are you truly from Luoyang?

109
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,463
I am.

110
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,382
Back then, most of us had
contracted diseases from the flood.

111
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,143
Only a few people in the village survived.

112
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,422
Mother and Sister didn't make it.

113
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,098
I was the only one.

114
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,881
Back then, Mr. Wu's family was wiped out.

115
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,663
He was fortunate enough to obtain the cure.

116
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,188
But it was already too late.

117
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,182
He met me by accident
and gave me the medicine.

118
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,622
That's how I was able to survive.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,622
That many people died
during the plague, huh?

120
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,647
Kang, let me ask you something.

121
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,103
Where did Mr. Wu get the medicine?

122
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,943
Mr. Wu said he found it
at a merchant's residence.

123
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,703
Is their surname He?

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,343
Mr. Wu didn't say anything
about that, but I'm sure it's not He.

125
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,382
How could you be sure of that?

126
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,583
It wasn't like the disease was incurable.

127
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,840
It's just that the herb required
for the medicine is expensive.

128
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,670
It required the bark of a rare peony plant.

129
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,281
They said He Apothecary, the
largest apothecary in the city,

130
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:52,893
sold such peony bark.

131
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,857
But the owner used the
opportunity to raise its price

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,520
and sell all of them to
the rich and powerful!

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,022
Could you be mistaken?

134
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,262
No way! I remember everything clearly!

135
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,439
Back then, Mother
brought me and the villagers

136
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,742
to kneel outside the apothecary.

137
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,063
They told us that they
ran out of peony bark.

138
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,823
But I saw them getting in the
carriage with packs of medicine in hand!

139
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,862
The packaging was very exquisite.

140
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,002
Let me ask you this.

141
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,662
What kind of design was on the packaging?

142
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,366
It was a cloud.

143
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,782
A red cloud.

144
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,103
I was also hoping that Mother
could receive a pack of medicine.

145
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,703
But no one cared about them
no matter how long they knelt!

146
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,730
The villagers started to die one by one.

147
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,777
Even the vacant land behind the hill
had no space to bury all the corpses!

148
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:57,707
Too many people died during the plague.

149
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:00,071
The number of casualties was too high.

150
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,703
Mr. Wu said that the peony
cultivator left all of us in the lurch.

151
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,063
The peony bark she cultivated
was the same as poison!

152
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,463
Everyone didn't die because of the flood.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,076
They died because of He Apothecary!

154
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,357
They're our enemy!

155
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,750
Stop spouting nonsense.

156
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,343
You're a kid. Don't spout such nonsense.

157
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:18,581
I'm not spouting nonsense!

158
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:20,432
Stop it.

159
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:42,324
Kang,

160
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,063
so, why did you guys come to Chang'an

161
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,742
after Mr. Wu had rescued you all?

162
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,902
Mr. Yang brought us here.

163
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:53,291
Was it Jiang Chang Yang?

164
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,254
Mr. Wu fed me the medicine.

165
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,247
I woke up in a daze in
the middle of the night.

166
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,778
I actually saw him trying to hang himself.

167
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,693
Mr. Wu!

168
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:14,142
He was only rescued because
Mr. Yang made it in time.

169
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,415
Mr. Wu!

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,223
That night, Mr. Wu sobbed for a long time.

171
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,640
Mr. Yang spent a lot of
time to persuade him too.

172
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,463
Mr. Yang told me that I would
be Mr. Wu's son in the future.

173
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,190
Mr. Wu would only have the will to live on

174
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,303
if everyone in the orphanage
was safe and sound.

175
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,721
The root bark of this
flower can relieve heatiness,

176
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:50,662
cool the blood, and
dispel various types of pain.

177
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,223
When combined with Zhimu,
Huangbai, and Shengdihuang,

178
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,262
it can relieve damp-heat in the lungs.

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,423
This is the herb we need
the most for the plague.

180
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,063
The Ice Crystal Peony we grow
is extremely rare and precious.

181
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,943
During times like these, our
herb is even more precious.

182
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,142
I grew up under Mother's care.

183
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,183
I know her character the best.

184
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,349
She would never be this heartless.

185
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,802
Could there be a misunderstanding?

186
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,983
My mother knows medicine pretty well.

187
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,956
If someone tries to poison
her, she'll surely find out.

188
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,943
But she didn't bring it
up even before her death.

189
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,183
Why would Madam know about it?

190
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,006
I need to return to Luoyang.

191
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,332
Coming.

192
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,382
What's wrong? Can't I
return to my home now?

193
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,303
Mu Dan, what do you mean by this?

194
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,754
You...

195
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,494
I thought we already
had a deal in Chang'an.

196
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:06,715
Are you trying to break your promise?

197
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,823
I came to Luoyang to find
Father, not you. Get out of my way.

198
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,001
But since you've severed
your ties with the He family,

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,596
you should stick to your duties

200
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,103
and not look for the head of the family.

201
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,399
Okay?

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,651
Mu Dan.

203
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,621
It's really you.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,902
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming back?

205
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,037
- Precisely...   - Come inside.

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,246
Come.

207
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,508
It happened so long ago.

208
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,551
Why are you bringing it up out of the blue?

209
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Back then, you guys only told me

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,463
that Mother was bedridden
because of an illness.

211
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,662
No one told me that she was poisoned.

212
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,878
Mu Dan, why would you
think of it like that? That's not...

213
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,423
Father, there's no need to hide the truth.

214
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,162
I've already found out.

215
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,943
Wu Hong was the one who poisoned her.

216
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,499
How did you...

217
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,862
You said you were returning to
your hometown a few days back.

218
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,262
But in reality, you went to
Chang'an to meet Mu Dan, huh?

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,343
Are you blaming me for it?

220
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,583
You should look at the state our
family is in. It's almost empty now.

221
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,902
Mu Dan is a daughter of the He family.

222
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,415
What's wrong with her
helping her family out?

223
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,578
Who told you to act on your own initiative?

224
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,246
Mu Dan.

225
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,416
I didn't know that it was your money.

226
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,983
Two years. I'll definitely return
the money to you in two years.

227
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,615
Return the money to her?

228
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,411
- But why?   - Shut up.

229
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,303
Mu Dan is a daughter of the He family.

230
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,343
It's her duty to support her parents.

231
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,423
Moreover, she's wealthy now.

232
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,423
You didn't see it for yourself.

233
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,071
Her business is booming right now.

234
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,502
We only asked her for a tiny bit
of money. I'm sure she won't mind.

235
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,181
- Shut up!   - I...

236
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,273
Father, I didn't come here
to demand my money back.

237
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,262
I'm afraid I would have no way to find out

238
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,622
what happened back then without Madam.

239
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,022
How much did you find out?

240
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,784
A lot.

241
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,583
Back then, Luoyang was
ravaged by the plague.

242
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,343
The Ice Crystal Peony, grown
by Mother, could save lives.

243
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,325
Father,

244
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,542
did you guys sell its bark to the
nobles and powerful back then?

245
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,190
On my way here, I kept thinking about it.

246
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,142
My parents, whom I'd admired
and respected since young,

247
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,823
could never be greedy people
who disregarded other people's lives.

248
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,543
No.

249
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,303
You mustn't say that about your mother.

250
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,262
She had no idea that this happened.

251
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,567
What do you mean?

252
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,223
I was the one who sold the bark
to the wealthy for a high price.

253
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,063
Your mother had no
idea where the herbs went.

254
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,862
I was the one who told her that
I'd distributed them to the people.

255
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,119
But why?

256
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,983
Did you do it to make more
money during the plague?

257
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,382
Back then, Luoyang was
ravaged by the plague.

258
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,183
The powerful and influential
lived in fear for their lives.

259
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,502
They forced me to sell
all of the herbs to them.

260
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,247
But after the flood,

261
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,238
the food and water sources of
the people were contaminated.

262
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,848
That's how the plague started.

263
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,343
The powerful and influential
merely remained in their residences.

264
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,502
The food they consumed
was precious and clean.

265
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,943
They wouldn't fall sick that easily.

266
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,823
They didn't care about that.

267
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,343
They were scared out
of their wits even though

268
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,760
only one or two of their servants fell
sick after making purchases outside.

269
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,863
They could only rest at ease when
they had stocked up hundreds of packs.

270
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,223
They were clearly fine and healthy.

271
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,903
Even so, they would rather stockpile
the herbs than save the others.

272
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,582
Father, how could you agree to such a deal?

273
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,223
I was just a merchant.

274
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,605
If I offended the rich and powerful,

275
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,872
they would seize all of our shops.

276
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,062
By then, you and your
mother would be implicated.

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,342
Mu Dan, I dared not take the risk.

278
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,844
So, that's why

279
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,346
you hid the truth from us back then.

280
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,837
Your mother was kind and soft-hearted.
Gardening was her only interest.

281
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,205
You were very young too.

282
00:17:54,332 --> 00:17:55,740
If I told you guys about it,

283
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,943
you guys would be worried without
being able to do anything about it.

284
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,463
I couldn't afford to make
you two suffer with me.

285
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,062
I couldn't bear to do it.

286
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,903
So, Mother...

287
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,547
Did Mother find out about it in the end?

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,302
Wu Hong told her about it.

289
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,983
After the disaster was over,

290
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,983
someone snuck into our residence
under the guise of a vegetable seller.

291
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,062
Your mother took pity on him.

292
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,943
She gave him some food,
clothing, and some money.

293
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,502
That person was Hong Wu.

294
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,223
How could this be?

295
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,903
If they took their medicine on time,

296
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,236
they should've recovered in a few days.

297
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,726
Only the rich and powerful can
afford such precious medicine.

298
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,324
There's no way wretched
people like us could afford it.

299
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,943
The root barks of He Apothecary
were distributed to the people for free.

300
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,782
One's status doesn't make a difference.

301
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,280
For free?

302
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,423
Madam, do you truly have no idea

303
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,542
about how much these herbs are selling for?

304
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,302
Could it be that the root barks I've grown

305
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,157
were sold to the sick for a high price?

306
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,022
It would've been fine if we could
purchase them for a high price.

307
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,742
But they were never sold to commoners.

308
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,742
They were delivered to the
residences of the rich and powerful.

309
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,623
How could that be?

310
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,943
The herb was a lifesaver,
and it was hard to find.

311
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,022
It was a great chance to make a fortune.

312
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:37,102
Seems like Mr. He
didn't tell you the truth.

313
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,414
So, outside...

314
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,342
Corpses have
littered the streets.

315
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,903
Half a month ago, many people
knelt outside the He Apothecary.

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,223
They knelt from day to night
just for a pack of medicine.

317
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,983
But all of them are in the underworld now.

318
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,822
My family was

319
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,542
among the innocent souls that were lost.

320
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,597
For the past 15 days,
I've been trying to get

321
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,423
the rich and powerful's
attention outside their residence.

322
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,742
But everyone ignored me.

323
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,943
If Mr. He was home,

324
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,703
I assume he would chase me away as well.

325
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,703
By a twist of fate,

326
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,302
I happened to meet you.

327
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
I've already laced your drink with poison.

328
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,223
Madam, please report me to the authorities.

329
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,582
You may do whatever you want to me.

330
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,062
Fate does play cruel jokes on us.

331
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,502
Initially, I wanted to avenge my family.

332
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,663
But no one expected you,
the one who grew the herb,

333
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,225
to have no idea about what happened.

334
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,463
You don't need to seek help to capture me.

335
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,822
I won't run away.

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,582
Now, I'm all alone in this world.

337
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,983
I don't intend to live any longer.

338
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,623
This is the last pack of Ice
Crystal Peony's root bark.

339
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,183
I wonder if anyone still needs it now.

340
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,262
Madam, what do you mean by this?

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,212
Just leave.

342
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,898
Don't you intend to report
me to the authorities?

343
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,983
So, the fire wasn't an accident at all.

344
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,742
Mother did it herself...

345
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,502
Your mother instructed
me to hide it from you.

346
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,542
But I knew that you would find out one day.

347
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,101
(The Memorial Tablet of Yang Yun Zhen)

348
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,302
Father, I have something
to discuss with you.

349
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,062
I intend to find the orphans and
relatives of the disaster victims.

350
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,623
If they need help, I'll do
everything I can to help them out.

351
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,183
I'll also list the names of the deceased

352
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,903
and erect tombs for them.

353
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,342
Let me do it.

354
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,582
You had no idea what happened back then.

355
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,262
I feel ashamed.

356
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,599
You did it to prevent me
and Mother from suffering.

357
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,863
You don't need to apologize to me.

358
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,062
Moreover, I'm a member
of the He family too.

359
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,943
I have the responsibility to
make it up to the victims back then.

360
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,423
I think Mother would want
me to do the same as well.

361
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,502
Mu Dan, I know you're
intelligent and capable.

362
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,143
But as a woman, you shouldn't
worry about such things.

363
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,903
The world is filled with
all kinds of suffering.

364
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,782
It's difficult for women to endure them.

365
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,183
You traveled to Chang'an
by yourself and suffered a lot.

366
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,943
Luckily, you married into the Jiang
family and got yourself a good husband.

367
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,983
Although Jiang Chang
Yang has a terrible reputation,

368
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,903
he's a noble after all.

369
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,302
He can ensure that you
won't suffer or be bullied.

370
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,502
Now, you need to look forward.

371
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,223
Manage the household well,

372
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,903
serve your husband
well, deliver his offspring,

373
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,062
and win his favor.

374
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,742
This way, you can be
safe and happy forever.

375
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,501
Father,

376
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
we were talking about how to
make it up to the disaster victims.

377
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,102
But now, you're trying to fight for
his favor for the sake of happiness?

378
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,797
You're a woman. This is your destiny.

379
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,920
Father.

380
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,744
Did you know why I left for
Chang'an instead of coming back

381
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,062
when I ran away from the Liu
family and tried to come home?

382
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,863
It was because I was
nearby when the Liu family

383
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,623
sent their men here to capture me.

384
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,782
I heard the conversation between you guys.

385
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,542
You said this yourself.

386
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,671
"For a woman, marriage
is her only destiny."

387
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,943
You said that you would send
me back to them if you found me.

388
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,183
To you,

389
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,742
I should feel honored that I
was marrying into the Liu family.

390
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,943
Leaving my husband
means humiliating myself.

391
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:14,546
I...

392
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,276
Back then, I had no idea
that they were after your life.

393
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,414
I...

394
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,930
Mu Dan.

395
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,542
Now, you've become completely different.

396
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,828
How am I different?

397
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,223
Now, you're one of Jiang
Chang Yang's concubines.

398
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,623
I was wrong back then.

399
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,302
Now, I hear that Lord
Jiang favors you a lot.

400
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,342
And, he doesn't have an official wife.

401
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,703
You should work hard

402
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,663
and not repeat the same
mistake you did with the Liu family.

403
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,850
Father.

404
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,353
Do you know something?

405
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,582
You dote on me and watch over me.

406
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,582
But at the same time, you look down on me.

407
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,983
Do you know something?

408
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,703
Back then, I escaped the Liu family,
resorted to using a fake identity,

409
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,397
and worked hard at my
business so that I wouldn't need

410
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,223
to be trapped behind courtyard walls,
breathing under another's shadow.

411
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,183
Mu Dan, things are not
as simple as you think.

412
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,082
You have no idea how difficult it is

413
00:27:29,438 --> 00:27:32,401
to manage a business and sustain a family.

414
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,863
Moreover, you're a woman.

415
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,756
You need to know that you're
able to speak with such backbone

416
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:41,516
all thanks to Jiang Chang Yang's support...

417
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,383
Father, do you truly think so?

418
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,542
In your eyes, women can only depend on men.

419
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,582
At least he can make your life easier.

420
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,191
Don't you agree?

421
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,262
Father, to you,

422
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,302
Mother might only be

423
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,502
an ordinary woman who loves gardening.

424
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,943
But to me,

425
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,383
she's the most gutsy and
amazing woman I've met.

426
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,463
Even during our lowest moments,

427
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,143
she cared about the disaster victims.

428
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,703
She created medicinal
packs with peony bark.

429
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,582
In her darkest hour,

430
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,342
she burned her favorite
peony patch to the ground.

431
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,423
She wasn't willing to join the
ranks of the rich and powerful.

432
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,262
Mother was the one who taught me
that women could lead a different life.

433
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,220
Father,

434
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,408
I understand.

435
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,344
You forsook your dignity and
conducted a deal with them

436
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:52,022
for the sake of our family.

437
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,903
I understand that you prioritized Man

438
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:59,238
to continue the family's bloodline
and please our ancestors.

439
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,262
You had no choice but to neglect me.

440
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,302
But even now,

441
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,742
you've never truly understood the
kind of woman me and Mother are.

442
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,542
What I desire

443
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,223
is something that you can never understand.

444
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,183
Therefore, Father, I cannot achieve

445
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,502
what you expect of me.

446
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,423
Mu Dan, why are you this willful?

447
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,383
I'm doing this for your own good.

448
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,863
As to how to survive in
this world as a woman,

449
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,863
I already have my own answer.
There's no point discussing it any further.

450
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:46,238
It's getting late.

451
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,582
I should head back

452
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,463
so that Madam won't be upset about my stay.

453
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,663
Didn't you say that you were
going to stay here for a few days?

454
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:57,234
No.

455
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,542
I have plenty of things to do in Chang'an.

456
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,037
Father.

457
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,782
You're getting old.

458
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,423
You don't need to worry too
much about the apothecary.

459
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,782
I've already instructed my
men to bring some money here.

460
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,582
It'll arrive in two days.

461
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,022
That sum should be enough for
the He family to make a comeback.

462
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,794
From now on,

463
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,062
you, Madam, and Man can lead a secure life

464
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,543
in Luoyang.

465
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,262
Father, you raised me.

466
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,102
I'll never forget about your kindness.

467
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,183
As for my affairs, I'll handle them myself.

468
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,542
Please don't worry.

469
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,559
Mu Dan,

470
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:27,983
why don't you have a meal
with us before heading back?

471
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,342
Father, I want some flatbread.

472
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,513
Okay.

473
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,921
I'll make them for you.

474
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,007
No thanks.

475
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,502
Father, take care.

476
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,143
My Lord, Madam He has returned.

477
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,411
Already?

478
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,663
I thought she would stay
in Luoyang for some days.

479
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,040
Da Fu said she sent her customers away

480
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,430
and close the shop early after her return.

481
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:43,502
She looked distracted.

482
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,804
She found out, huh?

483
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,463
(I was also hoping that Mother
could receive a pack of medicine.)

484
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,822
But no one cared about them
no matter how long they knelt!

485
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,822
The villagers started to die one by one.

486
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,022
Even the vacant land behind the hill
had no space to bury all the corpses!

487
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,903
Too many people died during the plague.

488
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,040
The number of casualties was too high.

489
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,943
Mr. Wu said that the peony
cultivator left all of us in the lurch.

490
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,302
The peony bark she cultivated
was the same as poison!

491
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,782
Everyone didn't die because of the flood.

492
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,302
They died because of He Apothecary!

493
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,742
(They're our enemy!)

494
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,449
Mu Dan.

495
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,702
When did you find out?

496
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,903
Before you sought out Mr. Wu.

497
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,423
He only told me about
the incident before that.

498
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,943
He never saw you

499
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,582
during the flood four years ago.

500
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,343
He had no idea that you
were Mr. He's daughter.

501
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,502
He made acquaintances with you
before this due to his admiration for you.

502
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,783
But he did harm your mother.

503
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,343
It's rightful for you to hate him.

504
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,876
Does it still hurt?

505
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,026
I know.

506
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,142
You stopped me from killing Mr. Wu

507
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:31,900
for my sake.

508
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,263
You were afraid that I might find out
about the cruel truth four years ago.

509
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,142
You were afraid that I might find
out what happened during the plague.

510
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:50,395
You thought that I might
regret what I did out of impulse.

511
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,120
I'm sorry.

512
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,823
There's no need to apologize between us.

513
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,332
But Mother and those
who died four years ago

514
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:12,009
could never receive an apology anymore.

515
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,463
As a herb seller,

516
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,540
if Father didn't yield to authority,

517
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,566
he couldn't protect me and Mother.

518
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,011
As one of the beneficiaries,

519
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:32,287
I have no right to criticize him.

520
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,022
But what did all those who
died innocent deaths do wrong?

521
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:46,178
I was bent on revealing the
truth and avenging my mother.

522
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,983
But in the end, I realize

523
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,343
that I have no one to hate.

524
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,943
I have no vengeance to seek.

525
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,485
I always thought that I could provide
wonderful moments and fragrances

526
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,491
to other people by doing what I did.

527
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,314
I had no idea

528
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,702
that plenty of people out there

529
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,303
were facing difficulties just to survive,

530
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,271
let alone having the
privilege to admire flowers.

531
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,983
The world is unfair,

532
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,142
and it is a cold and ruthless place.

533
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,123
Suddenly, I don't know

534
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,853
what it means to be a
good merchant anymore.

535
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,611
So what if I'm the Chief
Flower Merchant of the State?

536
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,767
What's the point?

537
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:56,125
Mu Dan,

538
00:37:57,848 --> 00:37:59,139
you've never made any ill-gotten gains

539
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,622
ever since you started your business.

540
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,702
You never went against your conscience.

541
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,130
You reopen Fang Garden

542
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,263
and gave all those
pitiful people a shelter.

543
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,405
That's not pointless.

544
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:21,922
I trapped myself in this square garden.

545
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,622
That's why I couldn't
see the truth of the world.

546
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,755
What exactly is the way of business, then?

547
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,662
I cannot figure it out.

548
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,102
I have no idea.

549
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,436
That's all, right?

550
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,662
We've cleared this month's account.

551
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,983
All of the payments have been cleared.

552
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,702
We have one last delivery left.

553
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,494
Da Fu, Xiao Chun, you
guys should join me by then.

554
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,423
I've summarized what each person is good at

555
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,943
and all of your work history.

556
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:54,592
Madam Tang,

557
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,263
when I'm gone, please assign everyone

558
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,903
to their positions
respectively on my behalf.

559
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,303
Make sure all of them
are in suitable positions.

560
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,502
After that, you may
transfer them to the shop.

561
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,679
It's fine if you guys wish to
stay in Fang Garden after this.

562
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,943
Mu Dan, what are you...

563
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,912
After the last delivery,

564
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:18,662
Fang Garden will be
closed for the time being.

565
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,877
The contracts, title deeds, and receipts of

566
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,983
Blooming Abode and Qingshu
Pavilion are inside this box.

567
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,102
Madam Sun, I'll entrust it to you.

568
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,634
I can rest at ease when I know that
you guys are managing the shops.

569
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,102
Blooming Abode and Fang Garden are
well-known throughout the capital now.

570
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,463
Are you really going to throw away
everything that you've achieved?

571
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,575
Yeah, Mu Dan.

572
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,022
Are you sure about this?

573
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:52,719
I've deeply reflected upon
my actions after this incident.

574
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,502
My past obsession and
dream have become a blur.

575
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,743
It's pointless if I force myself
to continue on this journey.

576
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,863
I need to straighten out my thoughts.

577
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,896
I need to understand the true
meaning of being a merchant.

578
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,438
My Lord, it's already the hour of Wei.

579
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,823
We have important things to do later.

580
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,170
Let's go.
