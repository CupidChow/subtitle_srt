00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:38,104
(In The Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:41,040
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,304
I knew Madam He was framed by a crook.

4
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,117
- Yeah.   - Madam He is a great person.

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,317
I knew she wasn't that type of person.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,280
Xiao Chun, Mu Dan.

7
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,942
It's all because of greed.

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,823
Why are you wounded?

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,823
We're fine.

10
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,623
We came out alive, didn't we?

11
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,153
Don't cry.

12
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,803
Young Master requested this medicine from Physician Fu personally.

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,422
He wants you two to use it as soon as possible.

14
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,983
I've made some tonics.

15
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,823
Mu Dan, both you and Xiao Chun need to rest and recuperate.

16
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,663
Thank you, Liu Lang. We'll have it later.

17
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,242
Go now.

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,297
Chun.

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,448
Father.

20
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,503
I've wronged you.

21
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,823
When you were in trouble,

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,422
I didn't even trust you.

23
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,063
Let me apologize.

24
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,663
After this incident,

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,702
I've found out that you do possess excellent medical skills.

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,543
Madam He is also sincere to you.

27
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,983
You've truly grown up.

28
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,644
You're a better judge of character than me now.

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,383
It was my fault.

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,917
I didn't like needlework in the first place.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,983
But I pretended to be a noble lady.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,182
I never allowed you to know the real me.

33
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,023
Now that your name has been cleared,

34
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,582
it calls for a celebration.

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,215
Let's drop the topic.

36
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,702
I don't know what to buy you as a gift.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,302
I only remember that you once said

38
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,902
that you liked this.

39
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,117
In the future,

40
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,742
you may be a physician if you want.

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,862
Everything's fine as long as you're safe and sound.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,647
Father.

43
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:03,741
The wind got into my eyes.

44
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:06,733
Don't let the wind get to it.

45
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:25,527
Madam He was the one who was released from prison, not you.

46
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,822
Why are you in a rush to take a bath and get changed?

47
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,704
One has to take a bath and light incense

48
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,622
to get rid of bad luck after being imprisoned.

49
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,957
Mu Dan's room is filled with incense.

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,223
I'm sure it's filled with fragrance.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,903
It's best for me to clean myself first before seeing her.

52
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:55,123
Lord Jiang.

53
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,173
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,583
Don't tell me you picked these flowers from Mu Dan's courtyard.

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,583
Lord Jiang, don't worry.

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,663
I bought them with my own money.

57
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,268
Now, I dare not provoke Mu Dan.

58
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,311
I'm glad to hear that.

59
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,182
First come, first served.

60
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,422
You may use the bath first. I'll take my leave.

61
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,463
Lord Jiang, I belong to you.

62
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,502
There's no need to draw a line between us.

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,000
Lord Jiang, you never spent a night in my room

64
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,143
after we got married.

65
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,463
It's been so long since we met.

66
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,622
The heavens must've been on my side today for me to encounter you.

67
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,721
Please allow me to serve you.

68
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,502
Lian Zhou, I'll be honest with you.

69
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,957
Ever since I married Mu Dan,

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,422
I had no interest in other girls at all.

71
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,903
I know. You must've suffered all this while.

72
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,983
Later, you can go to the treasury.

73
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,502
You can take whatever you like.

74
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:01,897
Okay?

75
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,436
You're His Lordship's foster daughter indeed.

76
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,543
You're truly understanding.

77
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,494
I'll be leaving now.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,343
Why did you bring a brazier here?

79
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,663
Have you conquered your fear of fire?

80
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,942
Chuan Yu brought it here.

81
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,742
He said it could dispel evil and repel filth.

82
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,422
It could even help you dry your hair.

83
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,966
It's fine. I can do it myself.

84
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,822
Just keep being stubborn, won't you?

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,463
Do you feel more comfortable now?

86
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,914
Usually, you're the shopkeeper of several branches.

87
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,640
You're the big sister who shoulders everything by herself.

88
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,223
You only have a brief moment of respite

89
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,422
at home, in the stillness of night.

90
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,175
That's enough.

91
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,742
This was supposed to be an act.

92
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,783
Why is the act becoming more and more genuine?

93
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,143
If Yue Lao were to see this, he might misunderstand us.

94
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,622
He might just cut all your red threads of romance.

95
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,160
Don't blame me for that when that happens.

96
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,783
I didn't intend to fall in love in the first place.

97
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,467
I don't need Yue Lao's service.

98
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,622
If he does tie my red thread of romance to a random person,

99
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,502
I'll sever it myself.

100
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,256
Stop that.

101
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,262
It's impossible to untangle it now.

102
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,813
Just cut it.

103
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,827
Good boy.

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,866
Say "Mu Dan."

105
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,215
Open your beak.

106
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,281
Say "Mu Dan."

107
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,395
Useless fool.

108
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,703
No matter how similar it resembles He Wei Fang's pet, it's not hers.

109
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,502
Young Master, you've done a lot for her.

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,622
The human heart is made of flesh. How could it not waver?

111
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,183
But she already belonged to the Flower Bird Envoy.

112
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,622
Young Master, you don't need to torture yourself like this.

113
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,983
Flower Bird Envoy?

114
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,622
You're right.

115
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,382
Flower Bird Envoy.

116
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,662
Toppling Jiang Chang Yang is the only way.

117
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,075
When He Wei Fang has no one to depend on,

118
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,343
only then will she believe

119
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,223
that I'm the only person in the world

120
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,709
who can help her realize her dream.

121
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,862
That's not what I mean.

122
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,943
Her Highness has feelings for you.

123
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,519
- Aren't you going...   - Young Master.

124
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,639
Young Master, we're in trouble.

125
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,223
A stranger had appeared at the dock thrice.

126
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,622
I've instructed my men to tail him. We haven't located him yet.

127
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,747
Keep a close eye on him.

128
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,463
Find out who's the mastermind behind him.

129
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,183
Do not let him foil our plans.

130
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,265
Yes, Young Master.

131
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,196
Madam He, your arm is still injured.

132
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,157
- Why don't I do it?   - It's okay. I can do it myself.

133
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,782
I can do it. You can resume your work.

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,502
Where is Zhao Cai carrying the pot of flowers?

135
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,662
Madam He, he's going to deliver it to Madam Lian Zhou's room.

136
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,223
Is Lian Zhou interested in flowers now?

137
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,223
Madam Mu Dan? What are you doing here?

138
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,022
I'm here to deliver some insect repellent to Lian Zhou.

139
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,209
Greetings, Madam He.

140
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,303
You mustn't just transplant the flowers like that.

141
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,616
Here.

142
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,782
You cannot transplant the peonies when they're blooming.

143
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,142
Zhao Cai, I suppose you never tended to flowers before this.

144
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,262
If you dig it out by force,

145
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,676
even if it can last until this year's spring,

146
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,343
it won't bloom again next year.

147
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,862
Mu Dan, may I know why you're here?

148
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,063
I saw that you had a pot of Ningyan Purple Peony.

149
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,703
This flower attracts bugs and pests easily.

150
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,303
I've brought you a bottle of insect repellent.

151
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:44,316
Thank you.

152
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,943
Lian Zhou, since you like flowers,

153
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,423
there's no need to instruct your servants to tend to them.

154
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,423
Zhao Cai doesn't know much about gardening.

155
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,183
Why didn't you look for me?

156
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,720
Initially, I was keeping them just for fun.

157
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:06,080
I didn't know that there was this much knowledge behind it.

158
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,463
I should return to painting and playing music in the future.

159
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,303
Mu Dan, there's no need to trouble you.

160
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,823
Madams, please go ahead and catch up. I shall take my leave.

161
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,350
Go now.

162
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,103
If you dwell in your room every day,

163
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,183
you'll let your years go to waste.

164
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,364
Regarding what I told you before, have you thought it through?

165
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,465
Do you want to step outside and try a different life?

166
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,502
Not everyone is lucky enough

167
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,223
to lead your so-called "different life."

168
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,703
I saw the sack on the table.

169
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,463
Lian Zhou, are you heading out?

170
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,223
I was intending to stay at Kaiyuan Temple for a few days.

171
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,823
I'll chant sutras and pray for blessings.

172
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,259
Kaiyuan Temple?

173
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,486
Meditation is quite tough.

174
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,435
What's with the sudden idea?

175
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,217
I wish to request the deities

176
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:18,103
to bless my relationship with Lord Jiang so that it may bloom.

177
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,091
Mu Dan, you're a generous person.

178
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,622
You won't stop me, will you?

179
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,325
Of course I won't.

180
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,240
(The flowers and soil were obviously dug out)

181
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,382
(after Cai Wei's loud announcement.)

182
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,183
(What was Lian Zhou and Zhao Cai talking about)

183
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,142
(for them to leave a guard outside?)

184
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,423
(Zhao Cai serves the Jiang Residence.)

185
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,742
(Can Lian Zhou bribe him that easily?)

186
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,914
Zhao Cai!

187
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,901
Young Master, please spare me!

188
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,288
You don't pick on your servants usually.

189
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,415
What's wrong with you today?

190
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,703
Do you have a grudge against him?

191
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,661
Why don't you take a guess?

192
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,262
(I suppose Jiang Chang Yang kept up his act)

193
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,183
(not just because he wanted people to know that he's evil.)

194
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,902
(I'm afraid some people had been keeping an eye on him for some time.)

195
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,343
(Jiang Chang Yang isn't in Chang'an.)

196
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,703
(If Zhao Cai is one of King Ning's men,)

197
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,983
(now that Lian Zhou is leaving the residence,)

198
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,662
(is she trying to harm Jiang Chang Yang in some way?)

199
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,196
I'm heading to Kaiyuan Temple to request blessings for my mother.

200
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,120
What a coincidence. We can make the trip together.

201
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,716
Mu Dan and I are best friends.

202
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,899
That's why I'm joining her.

203
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,262
Madam, Madam He has extinguished the lamps in her room.

204
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,302
A commoner using tributes meant for the imperial family will be executed.

205
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,062
Madam, must you buy this?

206
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,863
Madam, you're great at embroidering.

207
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,022
Although this Hualian Nichang Dress is old, its beauty still remains.

208
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,542
The lotus design on it resembles the real deal.

209
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,782
Back then, the embroidery house my father ran was the largest in Jiangnan.

210
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,159
I've embroidered countless dresses.

211
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,223
But now, the only dress I could find

212
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:03,803
and buy

213
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,542
is this dress.

214
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,062
I had a dream since young.

215
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,582
It was

216
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,703
to wear such a beautiful dress one day,

217
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,863
even if it's in the stillness of night,

218
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,782
and that I could only wear it for myself to see.

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,582
But my parents warned me.

220
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,542
They said merchants don't deserve to wear the outfits of the noble.

221
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,983
Until the day my father was harmed by a corrupt official,

222
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,062
and my family shattered,

223
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:56,881
I was never able to wear such a fancy dress.

224
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,863
Madam, I'm sure it's been tough.

225
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,502
Merchants are lowly.

226
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,903
No matter how huge their business is,

227
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:13,364
they live and die by the whims of officials.

228
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,102
Only by clinging to royals and nobles

229
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,936
can one hope to live amid luxury,

230
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,623
adorned with pearls and jewelry,

231
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,983
and be safe forever.

232
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,262
So, Lian Zhou came from a merchant background too.

233
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,223
Both you and her have experienced countless difficulties.

234
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,903
However, you two lead completely different lives.

235
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,646
We were protected by our family since young.

236
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:01,143
But her? Her family was shattered.

237
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,062
We might not be able to understand how tough her life was.

238
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,196
I assume no one gave Lian Chou a chance

239
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,903
to make a living with her embroidery skills

240
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,623
when she was desperate and hopeless.

241
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,158
The noble gave her a fancy cage,

242
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,302
one where she's well-fed, well-clothed, and free from worry.

243
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,022
Naturally, she thinks

244
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,062
that she can only lead a secure life by clinging to nobles.

245
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,782
If so,

246
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,062
I suppose even detestable people are pitiful in their own ways.

247
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,062
It's a sin for commoners even to buy

248
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,703
the used clothes of nobles.

249
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,087
I assume Lian Zhou has grown weary of

250
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,879
living each day cautiously with care.

251
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,183
She's just like Sheng Yi.

252
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,542
It's not that easy for them to start anew.

253
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,542
Once she lives here longer and becomes closer to us,

254
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,703
maybe she'll change little by little.

255
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,742
I hope so.

256
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,423
Let's take it as if this encounter never happened.

257
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,062
We mustn't let anyone else know about this.

258
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:12,503
Understood.

259
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,972
General.

260
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,703
Sui Zhi, spare the formalities.

261
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,836
I performed the bow on His Majesty's behalf.

262
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,223
We're paying our respects to your loyalty

263
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,582
and the years you spent defending Hedong.

264
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,463
I do not deserve this.

265
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,102
Please tell His Majesty not to worry.

266
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,077
No matter how close the governor of Fanyang is to King Ning,

267
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,357
they have to get through the Hedong Army before crossing the Yangtze River.

268
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,342
Naturally, His Majesty doesn't need to worry when you're here.

269
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:11,135
How has His Majesty been lately?

270
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,863
As long as the state is safe,

271
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,983
His Majesty will be at ease.

272
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,694
General, please rise.

273
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,408
Once the time is ripe, His Majesty will relay his order to Hedong.

274
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,407
By then, please come forward with his decree

275
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,389
and aid His Majesty in securing his legacy.

276
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,463
Sui Zhi,

277
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,703
please tell me the detailed plan.

278
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,463
Was Madam He suspicious of what you did a few days ago?

279
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,542
I've already dealt with her.

280
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,742
She never asked me about it again.

281
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,840
The Minister of Revenue had just passed away from sickness.

282
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,342
His position is vacant.

283
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,302
We need your help

284
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,054
to request Flower Bird Envoy to help King Ning's men acquire the position.

285
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,022
Jiang Chang Yang loves Madam He deeply.

286
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,223
He's not giving me any chances.

287
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,542
What can I do about it?

288
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,623
If Madam He is dead,

289
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,542
you'll have all the chances in the world.

290
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,326
What's wrong?

291
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,168
Are you treating her like a family member

292
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:24,062
just because you've lived with her for some time?

293
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,102
King Ning doesn't keep fools around.

294
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,342
He won't allow anyone to betray him either.

295
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,684
I'm only able to get to where I am today all thanks to King Ning.

296
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,463
I dare not forget his kindness.

297
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,463
Jiang Chang Yang cares about Madam He a lot.

298
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,822
If she dies suddenly, he'll surely conduct an investigation.

299
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,751
If they find out about you, you might still be able to protect yourself.

300
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,623
But what if they find out about me?

301
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,863
How can I face King Ning, then?

302
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,903
Once He Wei Fang loses his favor,

303
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,742
she'll no longer obstruct us from our goals.

304
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,526
You wouldn't be in this situation if you were able to defeat her.

305
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,755
Before this, I didn't understand

306
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,483
what Jiang Chang Yang liked about her.

307
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,102
Now, I finally understand.

308
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,383
Madam He has a silver tongue.

309
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,463
She could make him happy with her words alone.

310
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,183
And, when she does business,

311
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:35,351
she'll be able to procure profits for her husband.

312
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,623
Do you intend to make her a mute

313
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,022
and ruin her way of making a living?

314
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,062
When Lord Jiang returns, he'll only find out

315
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,542
that Madam He has turned into a mute due to an illness.

316
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,183
He'll surely be depressed about it. I have to console him.

317
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,863
I won't let King Ning down.

318
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,022
Mu Dan, I understood what you said to me.

319
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,079
I wish to learn

320
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,703
how to do business from you.

321
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,703
Are you sure about it?

322
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,703
On my visit to Kaiyuan Temple, I drew a lot.

323
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,742
It stated that Lord Jiang and I were not meant to be.

324
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,070
Now, I've given up on him.

325
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,682
Mu Dan, please guide me in the future.

326
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,183
Please teach me how to make money

327
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,663
so that I won't be poor and lonely when I'm old.

328
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,703
Lian Zhou, hurry and get up.

329
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,423
If you're truly able to let go of the past,

330
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,542
you won't need to fear again in the future.

331
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,502
You'll also lead a better life.

332
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,623
Now that you're in Fang Garden,

333
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,342
the people here and I

334
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,542
are your family now.

335
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,060
Mu Dan, take this pair of flower cups as my gift of apprenticehood.

336
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,990
Please teach me.

337
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:17,326
All right.

338
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,623
Coincidentally, I intend to try out a new liquor.

339
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,863
Lian Zhou, you're perceptive and knowledgeable.

340
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,143
Let's try it together.

341
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,460
Sure.

342
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,623
Fine liquor and fine cups go hand in hand.

343
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,703
Why don't you try it with this cup?

344
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,943
This peony cup is truly exquisite.

345
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,437
Here.

346
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,080
Lian Zhou?

347
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,664
What are you doing here?

348
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,463
I'm here to seek Mu Dan's teaching in the way of business.

349
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,654
Here.

350
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,516
The design of the cup is truly exquisite.

351
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,102
Since when did Fang Garden have something like this?

352
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,236
It's my gift to Mu Dan.

353
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,262
Da Fu, you should use it to try out the new liquor too.

354
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,716
Come. All of us should try it.

355
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,463
This is a new liquor brewed by Jin Niang. Have a taste.

356
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,367
Here, Lian Zhou.

357
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,742
It's pretty good.

358
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,010
What do you think?

359
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,269
(Jiang Residence)

360
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,591
All of you may leave.

361
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,204
Yes, Madam.

362
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,102
Madam, the gate of Fang Garden is open. They have relit their lamps.

363
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,956
Lv Geng Chun is rushing there.

364
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,102
I assume the poison has already taken effect.

365
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,742
Don't worry about it.

366
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,463
Mu Dan?

367
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,143
She was fine yesterday.

368
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,433
Why is she...

369
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,322
Last night, Mu Dan had a sudden sore throat. She couldn't breathe either.

370
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,582
She couldn't speak since the hour of Zi.

371
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,062
Physician Chun, what kind of illness has Mu Dan contracted?

372
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,276
I've tried acupuncture and given her medicine. Nothing worked.

373
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,782
I couldn't identify the cause.

374
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,094
Once Lord Jiang returns,

375
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,535
he'll surely request Physician Fu to treat her.

376
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,024
She'll definitely recover from this.

377
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,463
In this condition, she needs something that can relieve body heatiness.

378
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,453
Mu Dan.

379
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,663
My hand slipped because I was worried sick about Mu Dan.

380
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,036
Hurry and dispose of them.

381
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,423
If not, Mu Dan might be annoyed.

382
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,712
Yes, Madam.

383
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,983
I've destroyed all the evidence.

384
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,580
You may go.

385
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,703
It's dawn!

386
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,983
It's dawn!

387
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,868
Lord Jiang.

388
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,703
Mu Dan has fallen ill. She's at Fang Garden now.

389
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,262
Are you going to visit her?

390
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:13,716
Is that so?

391
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,863
Lian Zhou.

392
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,102
Mu Dan, why didn't you tell me that you were coming home?

393
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,542
How's your condition?

394
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,903
Don't act tough if you're sick, okay?

395
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,211
My condition?

396
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,262
I've always been great.

397
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,742
I never fell sick.

398
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,463
Lian Zhou, you rushed here this early in the morning.

399
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,903
Do you intend to have tea with me?

400
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:01,327
Are you trying to ask me

401
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,183
why I'm able to stand in front of you perfectly fine

402
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,302
and why the broken peony cup

403
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,383
has reappeared without any damage?

404
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,716
Lian Zhou?

405
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,463
What are you doing here?

406
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,022
I'm here to seek Mu Dan's teaching in the way of business.

407
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,742
I've never let down my guard

408
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,863
ever since I saw you and Zhao Cai plotting something together.

409
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,062
I sent my men to spy on you.

410
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,742
I never expected you guys

411
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,804
to try to poison me to death.

412
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,863
You applied poison to the inner wall of the cup.

413
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,582
That's very meticulous of you.

414
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,262
However, it's a shame

415
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,582
that I've already bought a pair of replicas before you.

416
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,022
The cup you smashed wasn't laced with poison.

417
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,742
As for the cup with the poison,

418
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,143
I'm holding it right now.

419
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,117
I've never committed such deeds!

420
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,996
Lord Jiang, Madam He was the one who persuaded me to learn from her.

421
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,223
That's why I bought her the pair of cups as a gift!

422
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,436
The cups aren't rare at all.

423
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,196
You can get them anywhere as long as you have the money.

424
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,863
How could that serve as evidence?

425
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,837
As for Zhao Cai,

426
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,077
I merely requested him to deliver my flower pots to me.

427
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,877
I didn't try to poison her at all!

428
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,108
Is that so?

429
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,983
Why don't you check this out?

430
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,502
This is the testimony of Master Zhang and Zhao Cai.

431
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,423
They confessed to their crimes at the local yamen long ago.

432
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:57,342
The problem has been dealt with. Our master is pleased.

433
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,502
This is the remaining payment.

434
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,891
Don't try anything funny!

435
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,463
Stay put!

436
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:19,975
Don't move!

437
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:32,303
We found the poison and the contract at your house.

438
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,463
Master Zhang, you used to be a charlatan.

439
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,943
Why are you producing poison and trying to harm people now?

440
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,022
Madam He, please spare me.

441
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,370
Magistrate, please spare me.

442
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,956
I know my fault now!

443
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,064
And you.

444
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:48,137
You've served the Jiang Residence for many years,

445
00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:50,360
yet no one knew you knew martial arts.

446
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:51,880
You hid your abilities for so long.

447
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,198
What?

448
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,263
Were you trying to assassinate your master in private?

449
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:58,960
Maybe you wouldn't be executed for failing to poison me to death.

450
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,903
But Magistrate,

451
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,517
what if a servant tried to kill his master, who's an imperial official?

452
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,713
How will he be convicted?

453
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,423
Servants who attempt to kill their masters will be executed.

454
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,357
Although I know martial arts, I bear no ill will toward my master.

455
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,797
Lian Zhou was the one who sent me here.

456
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,062
Lian Zhou was trying to kill you.

457
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,463
I wasn't willing to commit such unpardonable sins either.

458
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,142
Lian Zhou forced me to do so.

459
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,678
Madam He, please spare me.

460
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,084
Magistrate,

461
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,516
Lian Zhou is a gift from King Ning to Lord Jiang.

462
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:31,065
If I let you deal with her, you'll be caught in a difficult spot too.

463
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,917
Since this is one of Jiang Residence's private affairs,

464
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,062
I'll tell Sui Zhi about it once he has returned.

465
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,863
You won't need to go through all the trouble.

466
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,743
Madam Mu Dan, thank you for bearing no grudge and showing compassion to me.

467
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,917
Madam, you're virtuous and wise.

468
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,222
Flower Bird Envoy is lucky to have a wife like you.

469
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,728
You flatter me.

470
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,542
As for these two, they've been caught red-handed with evidence.

471
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,863
Please deal with them according to the law.

472
00:36:02,152 --> 00:36:03,294
Lian Zhou.

473
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,622
I was nice to you.

474
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,943
Why did you do this to me?

475
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,463
You've truly let me down.

476
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,383
Sui Zhi, you have to uphold justice for me.

477
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,892
Now,

478
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,903
you try to poison Mu Dan just because she's my favorite wife.

479
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,863
What if you hate me in the future?

480
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,702
What will you do to me, then?

481
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,383
Sui Zhi, you mustn't.

482
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,662
Lian Zhou is a gift from King Ning.

483
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,466
On account of His Highness, you mustn't hurt her.

484
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,241
All of you may leave.

485
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,383
I've inspected the poison purchased by Zhao Cai.

486
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,182
The dose was high enough to take one's life.

487
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:20,783
However, the dosage of the poison in the cup was carefully calculated.

488
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,383
It would only turn someone into a mute without taking their lives.

489
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,582
Therefore, I know you didn't try to take my life.

490
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,182
Sui Zhi, all in all, it's about the residence's private affairs.

491
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,783
I have something to tell Lian Zhou.

492
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,142
Please allow me to deal with her in private.

493
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,956
All right.

494
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:44,728
Suit yourself.

495
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,169
You may rise.

496
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,510
After you entered our residence,

497
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,554
Sui Zhi didn't care about you at all.

498
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:17,654
You hated me because you thought your years were wasted due to me.

499
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,702
I don't blame you for that.

500
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,353
I'm not blaming you

501
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,352
because you still have a conscience.

502
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,296
However, you still did something wrong.

503
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,022
Therefore, I cannot allow you to remain in Jiang Residence.

504
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,564
I understand.

505
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,111
No matter what you do to me,

506
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,182
I have no complaints.

507
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:45,132
What I told you before were my heartfelt words.

508
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,594
I never intended to compete with you

509
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,502
or fight with you.

510
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,914
Just like what I've said before,

511
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,943
maybe you didn't have the choice to lead a carefree life in the past.

512
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,005
But today,

513
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,142
I wish to give you a choice.

514
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,255
Mu Dan, what do you mean?

515
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:09,059
It's either Sui Zhi sends you back to King Ning's Residence tomorrow.

516
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:12,385
Maybe King Ning might give you to another noble figure.

517
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,343
Although you'll be well-clothed and well-fed,

518
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,423
it's likely that you'll be involved

519
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,463
in some sort of internal strife.

520
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,846
Or,

521
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,054
Lian Zhou dies today.

522
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,359
From now on,

523
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:35,014
you'll have a change of identity, and you'll be sent elsewhere.

524
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,383
I'll send you to a beautiful place.

525
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:42,267
Over there, you can make a living with your craft alone.

526
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,271
You will no longer be owned by anyone else.

527
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:54,024
You might even find a husband who treats you sincerely there.

528
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,572
If so, you can lead a secure and happy life.

529
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,993
Relationships cannot be forced.

530
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:04,958
I don't wish to ruin your future either.

531
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,600
Since Mu Dan is giving you a choice,

532
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:10,094
go ahead and make your choice.

533
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:35,378
Mu Dan, I shall never forget your kindness.

534
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:38,279
However, I'm hugely indebted to King Ning.

535
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,793
I have to blame myself for not being able to win over Lord Jiang's heart.

536
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,413
I cannot blame anyone else for that.

537
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,223
Lord Jiang,

538
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,359
please send me back to King Ning's Residence.

539
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,360
(Jingsheng Palace)

540
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:12,268
Mu Dan has already sent my servant to the local authorities.

541
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,743
But Lian Zhou, she's your foster daughter.

542
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:18,240
I dare not act on my own initiative.

543
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:22,038
After some consideration, it's better for me to send her back.
