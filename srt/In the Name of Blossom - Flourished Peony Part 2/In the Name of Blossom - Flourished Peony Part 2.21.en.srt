1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,880
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,920
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,302
How can you kill me on your own?

4
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,433
Sui Zhi's shadow guards
are located all around the city.

5
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,135
I've met with them earlier.

6
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:57,035
A few crossbows

7
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:59,450
are aiming at this place
outside the windows.

8
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,765
If I smash this jar of wine,

9
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:05,365
tens of thousands of arrows
will shoot in from the windows.

10
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:11,910
I'm only after Liu Chang's life.

11
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:15,467
If you guys leave right
now, I won't implicate you.

12
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:18,797
Do you think I'll believe you?

13
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,482
Vice Minister Liu, our men
merely blocked off the streets.

14
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:25,759
We didn't inspect the upper
floors of the building nearby.

15
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,136
Useless fool.

16
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:31,465
Fine.

17
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,462
Since you guys wish to
perish together with him,

18
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,037
I'll grant you your wish!

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,188
Wait!

20
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,781
Vice Minister Liu, this
isn't His Lordship's order.

21
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,746
We can't afford to die for no reason here.

22
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:44,882
Please pardon us.

23
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,264
Let's go!

24
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,291
Smash it, then.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,022
I don't think you dare to do so.

26
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,494
Liu Chang, seems like
you don't fear death at all.

27
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:10,427
If what you said were true, I
would've been dead anyway.

28
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,055
Why don't I just perish together with you?

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
Even if we were to
arrive at the underworld,

30
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,448
I won't let you be together
with Jiang Chang Yang.

31
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,850
But if that was just a ruse,

32
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,441
I have to think of another
way to keep you shackled.

33
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,294
Liu Chang, do you think
that I dare not take your life?

34
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,263
I know your leg was crippled. Does
that mean your conscience is gone too?

35
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,439
Right now, there's no difference
between you, King Ning, and Liu Shen.

36
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,462
All of you are shameless villains!

37
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,182
So what?

38
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,823
So what?

39
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,231
He Wei Fang!

40
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,776
I'm the victor here.
You're my trapped slave.

41
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,984
Forget about Jiang Chang Yang,
who's already six feet under us.

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,063
I've already given you a
chance. Don't force me.

43
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,262
Liu Chang, do you think you have won?

44
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,783
You wanted to make a name for
yourself and bring honor to the family.

45
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,657
But in the end?

46
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,543
You're just a dog living
at the mercy of others.

47
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,358
Shut up.

48
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,422
Even if you capture me today,

49
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,599
in the future, I'll be
spending every moment

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,796
thinking about ways to kill you.

51
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,302
I told you to shut up!

52
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,182
You think I dare not kill you?

53
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,039
Liu Chang.

54
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,174
You cannot take me away.

55
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:56,541
Liu Chang!

56
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:58,857
Stop that!

57
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,405
Get up.

58
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,364
Xiao Xue Xi?

59
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,550
This has nothing to do with you.

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,502
I suggest you not to interfere.

61
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,980
Mu Dan is my bosom friend.

62
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,998
I'll definitely protect her.

63
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,680
She's the spouse of a rebel.

64
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,943
Do you know the consequences
of taking her away in private?

65
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:30,495
So, you know that she's
someone else's spouse, huh?

66
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,463
As for what happened today,
I'll surely report it to His Lordship.

67
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:37,504
But you?

68
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:40,439
You're just a live-in son-in-law.

69
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,470
Do you dare to tell His Lordship

70
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,622
that you've kept Mu Dan to yourself
and mobilized his troops in private?

71
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:52,772
Let's go.

72
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,803
There was a great upheaval in the capital.

73
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,918
Father didn't allow me to come initially.

74
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,056
But I was worried about your safety.

75
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,962
From now on, no one will hurt you again.

76
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,286
You may cry if you're upset.

77
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,620
It's useless to shed tears.

78
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,742
Right now, I have more
important things to do.

79
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,283
Xue Xi, how did you know
that I was at Huanyun Pavilion?

80
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,556
Madam, I've let Lord Jiang
down. I was separated from you.

81
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,734
That's why you were imprisoned.

82
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,855
Even death cannot justify my mistake.

83
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,397
Chuan Yu, hurry and
get up. I'm fine, aren't I?

84
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,632
Come on. Get up.

85
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,076
But I...

86
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,086
I failed to save Lord Jiang.

87
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,838
I failed to protect She Yan either.

88
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,213
There were many
casualties during the uprising,

89
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,063
yet here I am, barely surviving.

90
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,703
Get up and speak.

91
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,862
Hurry. All of you, get up.

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,720
Just get up.

93
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,671
Xue Xi has told me everything.

94
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,575
You gathered the shadow guards

95
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:40,103
and tried to locate me
while staying hidden.

96
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,241
You saw the palace lamp in time.

97
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,970
After that, you notified
Xue Xi to rescue me.

98
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,396
All of you have rescued me.

99
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:53,857
I will never forget your kindness.

100
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,713
If Jiang Chang Yang is
seeing this from above,

101
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:03,847
I'm sure he'll be grateful to you all too.

102
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,987
Lord Jiang has passed away.
Now, we don't have a master.

103
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,891
Madam, from now on, I'm at your command.

104
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,150
Madam, from now on, we're at your command!

105
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,187
Mu Dan, the current
situation isn't clear yet.

106
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,505
It's dangerous for you
to remain in Chang'an.

107
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:30,984
Why don't you return to Hexi with me?

108
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,084
My Lord, that He Wei Fang is crafty
and cunning. We mustn't set her free.

109
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,103
She's just a woman.

110
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,137
She has lost her husband. What
trouble can she possibly stir up?

111
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,720
But those governors,

112
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,031
all of them are cunning old foxes.

113
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,606
They act according to the situation.

114
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,727
Only the Xiao family was willing
to affix their seal to the agreement.

115
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,063
Hexi and I share wealth and woe together.

116
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,262
We mustn't offend them
before the deed is done.

117
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,712
But My Lord...

118
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,303
Don't think that I have
no idea about your motive.

119
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,692
I dare not do so!

120
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,743
Right now, we need to figure
out how I can ascend the throne.

121
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,024
The Ministry of Revenue and the
national treasury are already under me.

122
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,508
As to how to convince
the hesitant governors,

123
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,073
I'm sure you don't need
me to teach you what to do.

124
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,182
I understand.

125
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,297
Her pulse is stable. She
hasn't sustained any injuries.

126
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:41,122
I knew that Mu Dan was
blessed by the heavens!

127
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,059
I'm glad that you're fine.

128
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:44,434
You guys panicked for nothing.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,190
I already told you that I was fine.

130
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,200
Is everyone okay? Was anyone implicated?

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,902
Don't worry. The rich and powerful
don't care about merchants like us.

132
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,239
Liu Chang merely investigated
us when he was searching for you.

133
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,983
But he didn't make things difficult for us.

134
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,695
What about Li Xing? How is he?

135
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,210
Li Xing is struggling to
navigate through court politics.

136
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,647
He's been having a tough time.

137
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,854
But luckily, his life isn't in danger.

138
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,841
He wanted you to look after yourself
upon hearing that you were safe.

139
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,680
I'm glad that he's safe.

140
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,179
I'm glad that he's safe.

141
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,360
Mu Dan, I've followed
your instructions in the letter.

142
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,382
Liu Lang, Madam Tang, and Madam Sun

143
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,502
remained in Chang'an
to look after the shops.

144
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,191
As for the gardeners and
servants of Fang Garden,

145
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,009
they all work with Father at Fang Garden.

146
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,103
As for us, we'll definitely
follow you wherever you go.

147
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,879
Don't think that you can
get rid of us with just a letter.

148
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,423
I'm truly fortunate to have
you two as my friends.

149
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,742
It's just that this
will be a perilous trip.

150
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,371
My life might be in danger.

151
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,917
I don't want you guys to get involved.

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,095
We're not afraid.

153
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:53,063
We're sworn sisters. We
promised to live and die together.

154
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,964
And, the tougher your trip is,
the more you require a physician.

155
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,659
It took us a long time to persuade the guys

156
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,650
that only the two of us could join you.

157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,262
If we don't follow you, the guys in
Chang'an won't be able to rest at ease.

158
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,493
Precisely.

159
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,622
All right. Let's depart together, then.

160
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,183
I'll definitely ensure your safety.

161
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,022
The three of us will go
and come back together.

162
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,400
No one will be left behind.

163
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,615
Okay!

164
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,196
We must protect each other
and stay together forever.

165
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,389
We won't be separated.

166
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,292
That's right.

167
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,565
Da Fu.

168
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,622
For this trip, besides the three of us,

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,340
another person will follow us as well.

170
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,491
Look.

171
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,039
Chuan Yu?

172
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,181
Are you okay?

173
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,678
How is it? Are you hurt? Let me see.

174
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,795
Mu Dan, have you truly made up your mind?

175
00:11:57,264 --> 00:12:00,703
If you come with me to Hexi,
I'll make sure that you're safe.

176
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,376
We only have one life, and I
don't want to leave regrets behind.

177
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,460
Xue Xi, I hope that you
can cover my tracks for me.

178
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,534
Don't worry.

179
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:20,359
I'll surely make everyone think
that you followed me to Hexi.

180
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,083
Take care, okay?

181
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,572
You too.

182
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,593
I never expected Sui Zhi
to hide so many secrets.

183
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,462
Poor child.

184
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,456
Now that he has finally gotten
himself an excellent spouse,

185
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,251
he passed away after that.

186
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:57,587
I couldn't even see him for the last time.

187
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,689
Aunt, Sui Zhi sacrificed
his life for the sake of justice.

188
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,542
Although his death is
regretful, he has no regrets.

189
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:09,912
The dead cannot return to life.

190
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,502
The living should stay strong.

191
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,542
I'm sure he doesn't want you
to shed tears because of him.

192
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:21,015
Those darned rebels.

193
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,923
They harmed Sui Zhi
and tainted his reputation.

194
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,351
How can I not hate them to the core?

195
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,248
Aunt, I have a favor to ask of you.

196
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,216
Mu Dan, get up and speak.

197
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,027
I didn't come here to seek refuge.

198
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,787
Aunt, I'm here to request help from
you to avenge Jiang Chang Yang.

199
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,131
I intend to expose and root out the
treacherous King Ning and his faction.

200
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,906
I want to avenge the innocent souls
who died at the Shaowei Banquet.

201
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,976
This is a difficult task. Even
loyal officials might fail at this.

202
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,747
We're merely women.
How could we achieve that?

203
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,296
Before I came to Jizhou,

204
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,502
I've already sent Chuan Yu to Hedong
to meet up with General Yu Zheng.

205
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,823
His father suffered a terrible death in
Chang'an due to King Ning's ambush.

206
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,704
His only wish is to avenge his
father, restore order to the state,

207
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,904
and fulfill the great cause that
General Yu Chang left unfinished.

208
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,494
The Hedong Army is brave and valiant.

209
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:40,943
Therefore, I wish to
use the money I've made

210
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:44,399
to strengthen their
forces, stockpile provisions,

211
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,319
and purchase better weapons.

212
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,983
Once the time is ripe,
they'll return to Chang'an

213
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,583
and slay the treacherous villains.

214
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,363
Assisting King Qin and
his army is a perilous task.

215
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:02,273
Mu Dan, I'm sure Sui Zhi wouldn't
want you to endanger your life like this.

216
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,995
I didn't do it merely for the
sake of Jiang Chang Yang.

217
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,836
I understood one thing when I decided

218
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,302
to open Wuyong Clinic.

219
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,391
Merchants can only establish their trades

220
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,511
and people can only live in peace

221
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,127
when the state has a wise ruler.

222
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:27,782
And, Jiang Chang Yang sacrificed
himself for the sake of a peaceful era.

223
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,895
I'll finish his unfulfilled cause.

224
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:35,506
I have no regrets even if I
were to die on the same path.

225
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:45,902
All right.

226
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,871
I'll assist you.

227
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,630
Just tell me whatever you need.

228
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:58,522
Thank you, Aunt.

229
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,300
Sui Zhi and I had kept some
golden ingots before this.

230
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,422
But they won't be enough.

231
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,468
Aunt, you once said you sailed
across the seas and visited foreign lands.

232
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,680
May I borrow your ship?

233
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,611
Before we got on the ship,

234
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,026
Da Fu told me that she
would definitely be seasick.

235
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,192
I never expected myself
to be seasick instead.

236
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,302
You can laugh at me if you want.

237
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,139
Mu Dan.

238
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,872
This is a thick Pinellia decoction.
It can stop your seasickness.

239
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,062
I'm just afraid that it
might be very bitter.

240
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,034
It's fine.

241
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,663
It won't be as bitter once I have some tea.

242
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,954
How is it?

243
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:04,632
Our son has been eating
wheat bran for five days straight.

244
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:06,278
Have you not received your wages yet?

245
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,728
You should urge your employer to pay up.

246
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,815
The county's taxes are
getting heavier and heavier.

247
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,822
Even my employer
doesn't have any money left.

248
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,611
I visited them a few days ago.

249
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,996
Their daughter was
having wheat bran as well.

250
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,477
- There's hope for us! - Look!

251
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,800
I got some millet!

252
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,877
- Really? - Look. Here's the millet.

253
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,542
- Where did you get it? - At the dock.

254
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,348
Hurry and go there!

255
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,082
I'll go and take a look.

256
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,125
- Hurry. - Where is it?

257
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:30,254
I got it at the dock.

258
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,834
What's wrong with my son?

259
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,662
This is merely a case of bloating.

260
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:37,750
- He's fine. - Dear folks.

261
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,183
The millet and wheat
noodles cost 50 wen per sack.

262
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,637
- We don't have any money. - Yeah.

263
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,463
If you don't have money, you can
barter with local products or labor.

264
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,376
Around here, it's hard to even find
a single stalk of wheat with full ears.

265
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,920
We don't have any local products here.

266
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,119
Yeah.

267
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,718
Madam, look.

268
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,943
The dragon beard grass you're
wearing is more than just an accessory.

269
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:01,567
Its roots and stem can be
turned into mats and paper

270
00:19:01,846 --> 00:19:03,869
while its leaves can be used for medicine.

271
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,896
Please keep it.

272
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,184
Everyone, look here.

273
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,303
Yu County is filled
with hills and mountains.

274
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,745
There are plenty of precious herbs

275
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:14,046
that are unrecognizable to the people

276
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,131
like dragon beard grass,
black gooseberries, and so on.

277
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,578
We've already drawn them for you.

278
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,983
If anyone needs the picture,
you can procure it here.

279
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,856
Search for them according to the
pictures and exchange them for food.

280
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,010
Understood?

281
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,910
All right!

282
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,916
All of these are herbs.

283
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:28,815
Don't be impatient.

284
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,022
Everyone has one.

285
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,560
There's no need to fight over it.

286
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,158
- It's your turn. - Okay.

287
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,476
One sack of millet.

288
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,612
Okay.

289
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,305
Yu County is poorer than the
counties we've visited before.

290
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:43,495
Luckily, they have local products as such.

291
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,383
Although we gave them some
profit, we didn't incur any losses.

292
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,742
Now, we're preparing provisions
and rations for the Hedong Army.

293
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,782
We can't do all the virtuous
work, but every bit of help counts.

294
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,673
Come. Put it here.

295
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,271
Let me select them.

296
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,103
Young boy, what do you need?

297
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,703
Mother wants me to buy a bowl of
lamp oil so that I can study at night.

298
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,623
But I...

299
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,170
You want to buy this hand
balm for her, don't you?

300
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,096
Mother hopes that I can
become an official when I grow up

301
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,475
so that she can lead a good life.

302
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,423
But now, I want her to lead
a life that's more comfortable.

303
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,151
If I buy this,

304
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,386
does that mean her
hands won't form blisters

305
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,542
when she scrubs other people's laundry?

306
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,018
Take it.

307
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,520
I shouldn't take it for nothing.

308
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,502
I only have five wen. I
can only afford one option.

309
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,608
Who said I was giving
it to you for nothing?

310
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,710
You bought this hand balm.

311
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,696
As for the lamp oil, you can
take it as a credit purchase.

312
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
You can repay your credit in the future.

313
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,742
We are unrelated.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,542
Why are you allowing
me to purchase with credit?

315
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:56,271
It's because I feel the
same as your mother.

316
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,223
I hope that you can pass the
imperial exam, become a good official,

317
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:02,047
and help everyone to lead better lives.

318
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:05,399
By then, you can return
the five wen you owed me.

319
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,403
Just take it.

320
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:10,104
Thank you, shopkeeper.

321
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,742
Please tell me your
name. I'll surely study hard

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,102
so that I can repay my debt in the future.

323
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:19,111
I'm Ms. Feng from Jizhou.

324
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,520
Young boy, may you pass
your exams with flying colors

325
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,961
and become a talent who
could bring relief to the people.

326
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,302
I'll remember that. Thank you, Ms. Feng.

327
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,502
Don't be scared. We come in peace.

328
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,875
(Sanjiu Clinic)

329
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,319
The Juebei barbarians launched a raid.

330
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,502
No one dared to open
their doors for business.

331
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,903
I had no choice either.

332
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,423
My spouse has been suffering
from a runny nose lately.

333
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,733
That's why I came here to seek
your help while there's no one outside.

334
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,167
It's almost late fall.

335
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,604
It's easy for people to catch a cold.

336
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,143
Many of the people here
didn't receive treatment in time.

337
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,703
Luckily, they didn't raid my place.

338
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,863
The prescription is ready.

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,183
Take it thrice per day. Take it back.

340
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,582
Brew them on time.

341
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:35,984
Here.

342
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:37,652
Thank you, shopkeeper.

343
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:42,916
Mr. Yang.

344
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,339
Ms. Feng?

345
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,183
I have no money to purchase your goods.

346
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,996
Sorry for the wasted trip.

347
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,062
I'm truly sorry about it.

348
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,503
Mr. Yang, what happened here?

349
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,061
Just now, the Juebei
barbarians raided our city.

350
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,463
They made an announcement to the city.

351
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,742
They said they would return here tomorrow.

352
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,943
They wanted us to put our
food and money on our doorstep.

353
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,371
I thought the Hedong
Army was stationed here.

354
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,566
The barbarians from
Juebei should fear them.

355
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:17,496
Didn't you guys report their deed to them?

356
00:23:17,975 --> 00:23:19,054
We did.

357
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,822
But we're right on the border with Juebei.

358
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,463
The barbarians travel
swiftly with their steeds.

359
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:26,974
They would've been gone

360
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,063
by the time the Hedong Army arrives.

361
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,463
They once laid an ambush
and eradicated them.

362
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,262
But another group came after a few months.

363
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,505
Now, we've submitted to fate.

364
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,431
They can grab whatever they want

365
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,490
as long as they don't harm us.

366
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,262
Ms. Feng, you should leave as well.

367
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,582
If not, they'll raid your
goods when they see you.

368
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,631
Mr. Yang,

369
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,742
can the people of Juebei
understand our language?

370
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,279
The two leaders can understand
and speak our language.

371
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,251
What are you...

372
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,647
I have an idea. Maybe it
can resolve the current issue.

373
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,283
Who are you?

374
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,098
I'm a merchant.

375
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,799
I wish to negotiate a huge
business deal with you.

376
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,061
Judging from your outfits, you
guys aren't Juebei's heavy cavalries.

377
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,240
I suppose you guys are hunters and nomads.

378
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,708
What does that mean?

379
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,128
Are you looking down on us?

380
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,623
That's not what I mean.

381
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,903
Tang is a state of customs and courtesy.

382
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,427
We're tolerant and
open-minded toward other states.

383
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,170
Since you guys grabbed the
goods without harming people,

384
00:24:58,194 --> 00:24:59,917
I can tell that you don't condone violence.

385
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,542
I'm afraid you had no choice but to
do so as there was no food at home.

386
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
What kind of business
deal do you wish to discuss?

387
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,441
One of my friends is from Juebei.

388
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,943
She once told me that the land
there wasn't suitable for cultivation.

389
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,185
But the cattle and sheep there
were raised exceptionally well.

390
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,769
You guys also have tall, fiery
steeds that gallop like the wind.

391
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:34,640
In our state, cattle and horses can
plow the fields and transport goods.

392
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,582
Sheep can be sold for their flesh

393
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,863
while its fur can be used to make clothing.

394
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,342
The ordinary goods you have in your state

395
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,663
can be sold for a very
high price in Central Plains.

396
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,439
Why don't you do a trade with me?

397
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,143
You won't need to worry about
food when you have money.

398
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,943
We can get ourselves food
by raiding cities and villages.

399
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,502
Why should we buy them?

400
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,423
Hedong is protected by General Yu Zheng.

401
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,822
How often do you guys dare to do raids?

402
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,062
And, how many casualties have
you sustained just to steal food?

403
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:12,184
The cities and keeps here
will only get poorer and poorer.

404
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,590
The amount of food you
can raid will reduce gradually.

405
00:26:16,336 --> 00:26:18,159
This won't work out long-term.

406
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:21,175
However, if we proceed with the trade,

407
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:25,903
you guys may bring other
food home besides grains.

408
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,502
If any of you fall sick, we have
herbs and prescriptions here.

409
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,486
We'll benefit from it mutually.

410
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,223
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

411
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,120
We'll return and discuss
it with our tribesmen.

412
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,223
We'll give you an answer in three days.

413
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,889
I'll wait for your good news.

414
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,337
They've left.

415
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,479
Guys, you all may come out. It's safe now.

416
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:21,756
You guys may come out now.

417
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,537
This is great.

418
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,616
Ms. Feng, you're so brave!

419
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,223
Please accept my bow!

420
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:27,998
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

421
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,239
Don't do this. Please get up.

422
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,623
Hurry and get up.

423
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,536
- Hurry and get up. - Thank you so much.

424
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,676
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

425
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,077
Hurry and get up.

426
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,260
Thank you so much.

427
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,703
If everything works out,

428
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,062
I can make money from the trade too.

429
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,611
I just don't know if they'll agree to it.

430
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,463
But guys, you don't need to worry too much.

431
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,638
I've already instructed my men to
write to the Hedong Army yesterday.

432
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,822
If they still insist on
their stubborn ways,

433
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,759
General Yu Zheng will negotiate
a deal with them personally.

434
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,703
This issue will surely be resolved.

435
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:01,074
Please don't worry.

436
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:03,140
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

437
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,742
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

438
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,822
Here you go, miss.

439
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,903
It's fine.

440
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,383
Thank you so much.

441
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:00,675
There's no need
to be courteous.

442
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:01,213
Please take them.

443
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:03,120
I appreciate your intentions.

444
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,734
But I won't take them.

445
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:05,535
Please take them.

446
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,610
I'm not taking them.

447
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,022
It's fine.

448
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,920
- Thank you so much. - Please take them.

449
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,742
Don't be so courteous.

450
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,302
I won't be taking them.

451
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,448
Thank you so much.

452
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,839
Ms. Feng, thank you so much.

453
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,456
Hurry! Those at the
back, don't fall behind!

454
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,546
All right.

455
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,569
Hurry up!

456
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:01,610
Don't fall behind!

457
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:32,335
Mu Dan will be delivering
goods to Hedong this time around.

458
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:33,742
Which of you will join her?

459
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,239
Chuan Yu. He'll escort her there.

460
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,616
There's a batch of herbs in the
south which we need to collect urgently.

461
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
Mu Dan instructed Da Fu and
me to collect them personally.

462
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,160
It's been a few days since I
saw Chuan Yu. Where is he?

463
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,280
Mu Dan instructed him
to complete some tasks.

464
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,888
I think he should be back by tomorrow.

465
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,082
Is this a calling card
delivered by the apothecary?

466
00:30:54,106 --> 00:30:55,400
What do they need?

467
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,554
The leader of the apothecaries
saw that our business was booming.

468
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,223
He heard that I had the
assistance of a capable niece.

469
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,022
He wanted me to pair Mu
Dan up with his eldest son.

470
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,022
Aunt, did you not tell them that
Mu Dan had just lost her husband?

471
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,998
I did, but they didn't mind it.

472
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:16,136
They praised Mu Dan for being capable.

473
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,463
He said they would treat
her well if they did get married.

474
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,223
But Mu Dan looks spirited and vigorous.

475
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,239
Maybe she has already gotten over it.

476
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,623
I suppose starting anew isn't a bad thing.

477
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,254
If that were the case,

478
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,285
she wouldn't avoid us and
go to pay respect to him alone

479
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:41,020
during Winter Clothes Day.

480
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,011
Da Fu and Chuan Yu have
made a promise to each other.

481
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,760
They would stand by
each other, in life or death.

482
00:32:27,943 --> 00:32:29,463
Chuan Yu has finally been enlightened.

483
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,831
That's one more concern off my mind.

484
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,181
But, who's Jiang Da Shan?

485
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,365
My name isn't that terrible.

486
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,898
You named me Jiang
Xiao Hua before, you know?

487
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:49,502
You're a rebel now. How
could I use your real name?

488
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,463
Just make do with it.

489
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:54,494
If you put my name like
this, when the offerings

490
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,575
from Winter Clothes Day and
Hungry Ghost Festival arrive,

491
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,348
the Hell King will distribute them to
other spirits as he cannot locate me.

492
00:32:59,372 --> 00:33:00,897
I was stingy as can be when I was alive.

493
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,641
I've never endured such humiliation before.

494
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:04,818
You're the best at acting.

495
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,614
You can use your old trick
and deceive the Hell King.

496
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,492
I may be able to deceive
the spirits and ghosts,

497
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:12,972
but you?

498
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,029
You should stop deceiving yourself.

499
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:18,970
I'm no longer around.

500
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,784
You should let go of the past

501
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:24,391
and start a new life.

502
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:36,882
Me?

503
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,270
I changed my name and traveled
everywhere as a merchant.

504
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,064
I've been to Juebei
and sailed as far as Silla.

505
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:50,956
I've seen plenty of
unexplored lands, even for you.

506
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:53,254
Doesn't that count as a new life?

507
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,156
I'm only here tonight

508
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:04,120
because you couldn't bear to
part with your obsession with me.

509
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:06,557
Did you forget?

510
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,014
When we were on the boat, you said

511
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:11,424
that you could live well by yourself

512
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:14,974
even when I was no longer around.

513
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,207
I've been leading a happy life lately.

514
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:25,200
I used the money I've
earned to support the people,

515
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,531
help the Hedong Army to
purchase better weapons,

516
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:30,078
and strengthen their forces.

517
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,846
I never betrayed the
grand ambition in my heart.

518
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,813
But right now,

519
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:39,703
the current you in front of me

520
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:43,009
isn't doing well at all.

521
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:51,684
I just feel melancholic

522
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,092
in the middle of the night.

523
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,654
I'm just a little unsatisfied.

524
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:05,823
I don't like that you're gone.

525
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:09,232
You cannot witness
what I've done for yourself.

526
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,053
- Mu Dan. - You should stop.

527
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,983
You're in my heart.

528
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,942
And I cannot get you out of it.

529
00:35:25,193 --> 00:35:26,776
We had a promise.

530
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,599
We were supposed to be together forever.

531
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:46,300
Don't leave!

532
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,839
Why can I touch you?

533
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,405
Was it the paper boat?

534
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,552
Has the paper boat delivered you to me?

535
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,565
Mu Dan.

536
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,711
This is a dream.

537
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,913
- Be careful. - Okay.

538
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:58,792
Shopkeeper, the goods have arrived.

539
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:00,128
Coming!

540
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,364
Magistrate Du, this is Ms. Feng.

541
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,759
She's here to deliver my goods.

542
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
All the permits and
contracts are in proper order.

543
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:14,094
I know who she is.

544
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,142
She's the famous Ms. Feng.

545
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,122
Sir, you flatter me.

546
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,520
Magistrate Du.

547
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:25,392
There are many people outside.

548
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:29,168
Why don't we talk inside if
you have something to say?

549
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,935
Ms. Feng, you're very
straightforward. I like it.

550
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:33,631
Come.

551
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:34,813
Magistrate Du, please.

552
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:42,448
Shopkeeper, you may relax and
unload the goods with my men.

553
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:43,937
All right.

554
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,414
Chuan Yu.

555
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:49,355
Let's unload the goods.

556
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:55,084
Ms. Feng, you're experienced
and knowledgeable.

557
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,582
I'm sure you know

558
00:38:57,086 --> 00:39:00,069
all merchants have to offer tributes to me

559
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,583
when they pass by Zhang County.

560
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:04,284
I've heard of that.

561
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,182
But I've only brought two carts worth
of goods with me this time around.

562
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,142
That's not even enough to
afford the cloak you're wearing.

563
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,222
After you're done here,
you'll proceed northward.

564
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:20,760
The rest of your goods are
located at Zhanghe Dock.

565
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,502
Magistrate, seems like you came prepared.

566
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,542
Tell your men to make a trip.

567
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,863
I don't care if it's banknotes or goods,

568
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,102
you may only leave Zhang County

569
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,502
if you leave behind at least
50 strings worth of coins.

570
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,135
Magistrate Du, there's no need
to go through all that trouble.

571
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,222
I've already prepared a gift for you.

572
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,091
Chuan Yu.

573
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,740
You actually have Silla's fish-tooth silk?

574
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:58,688
My trades with Silla were proper.

575
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,400
I never touched items that
were meant for imperial tributes.

576
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:05,147
Magistrate, don't you think
the fish-tooth silk looks familiar?

577
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:07,639
I took this from your residence.

578
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,400
You couldn't even recognize it, huh?

579
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,006
How dare you steal from
an official's residence?

580
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:16,457
Do you believe that I'll
apprehend you right now?

581
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,547
You're a magistrate, yet you extort money

582
00:40:18,571 --> 00:40:20,423
from the people and bully merchants.

583
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,799
It's more than just the fish-tooth silk.

584
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,943
The seal skin you're wearing
right now is also an imperial tribute.

585
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,343
Of course, I still have numerous
evidence of your crimes.

586
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,102
If I'm unable to leave the county today,

587
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:36,056
my men will deliver the
evidence to the authorities.

588
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,399
Do you know that I'm backed
by someone from the capital?

589
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:43,438
You might burn your fingers, you know?

590
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,112
Of course, I found out

591
00:40:46,201 --> 00:40:48,881
that your distant relatives in the
capital are backed by King Ning.

592
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:50,749
However, everyone knows

593
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:54,580
that the governor of this
prefecture is upright and impartial.

594
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,014
I'm afraid that you'll be stripped
of your position and banished

595
00:40:58,648 --> 00:41:00,671
before the people in
the capital could interfere.

596
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,799
Have you handed the
evidence to the governor?

597
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,736
I saw the governor reading
the evidence himself.

598
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,102
Magistrate Du's good
days are just about over.

599
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,700
From now on, the people and
merchants of Zhang County

600
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,871
wouldn't need to face his oppression again.
