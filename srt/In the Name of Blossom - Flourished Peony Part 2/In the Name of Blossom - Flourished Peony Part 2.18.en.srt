1
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,840
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,960
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:43,080
Lord Liu, do you mean

4
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:46,701
I should tell Father to cut the oil supply of both marketplace

5
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,120
so that they can't do their revisions at night?

6
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,266
The Minister of Agriculture has to inspect the warehouse from time to time.

7
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,613
It's reasonable even if he finds out the exam results ahead of time.

8
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:00,271
I've greeted the Ministry of Livestock.

9
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,573
From now on, all kinds of livestock have to be inspected.

10
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,567
They won't be able to stock them in the marketplaces.

11
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,753
Now, they won't be able to get their hands on any oil.

12
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,462
That's a brilliant move indeed.

13
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,102
Success is almost certain.

14
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,792
Lord Liu is wise indeed.

15
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,402
Now that they can't use the oil lamps,

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,503
they won't be able to study for long.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,316
They'll surely panic.

18
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm just worried that my foolish son won't come to his senses.

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,343
When it comes to current affairs essays, he can barely write a few lines.

20
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:30,794
Father.

21
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,961
You all have aided His Lordship on numerous occasions.

22
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,894
Naturally, His Lordship cares about you all as well.

23
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:41,269
What if we receive the exam questions beforehand?

24
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,689
With all that, do you still doubt that he can succeed?

25
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,571
Zhangchou Feng didn't know his boundaries.

26
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:58,207
The Jiang Residence was already seized when I received the news.

27
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:01,790
I'm truly ashamed.

28
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:08,201
Sui Zhi, please don't bear any grudges against me because of that fool.

29
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,730
My Lord, I'm a timid person.

30
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,915
The people tried to beat me up just because I took some bribes.

31
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,870
The imperial exam concerns the state's foundation.

32
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,350
I dare not steal the exam questions.

33
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,791
Sui Zhi, I beg to differ.

34
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:27,078
The noble families are the state's foundation.

35
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,936
My brother may care little for the stability of the state,

36
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:35,117
but as his subjects, we have to share his burden with him.

37
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:37,855
You come from a noble family as well.

38
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,577
Do you intend for us to surrender the court without resistance?

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,703
Or could it be that His Majesty has another intention in mind?

40
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,975
And that you aren't willing to share my burden with me?

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,004
All people have their own interests at heart.

42
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,482
My Lord, the money you're giving me will run out one day.

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,063
But if I get reinstated as the Flower Bird Envoy,

44
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:15,591
I can keep His Majesty company every day.

45
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:22,148
By then, I just need to lift a finger to get whatever you desire.

46
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,245
That's simple.

47
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:32,143
Tomorrow, I'll request His Majesty to reinstate you.

48
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,105
Thank you, My Lord.

49
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:39,527
The Ministry of Rites prepares the question sets for the imperial exam.

50
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,172
The final authority of approval rests in the hands of His Majesty.

51
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:46,093
I'll surely keep His Majesty company.

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,143
My Lord, please don't worry.

53
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,271
Once this deed is done,

54
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,862
there shall not be any discord between us any longer.

55
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,475
We managed to hang in there all thanks to Lord Jiang's oil supply.

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,862
Although the exam is nearing, they're unable to study.

57
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:19,486
Morale is low.

58
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,001
If we purchase lamp oil at a high price now, King Ning will be alerted.

59
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,951
The noble families are well-educated.

60
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,982
They also produce capable officials frequently.

61
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,647
Why must they do this to the modest scholars?

62
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:34,997
If they take shortcuts without following the proper path,

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,023
they'll surely become parasites in the future.

64
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,895
Have you given the exam questions to King Ning?

65
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,147
They're acting from both ends.

66
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,329
We must deal with them as soon as possible.

67
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,726
Thank you, my lady.

68
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,957
Thank you, my lady.

69
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,367
Everyone, there's no need to be courteous.

70
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,382
Everyone, I know you all have studied for many years.

71
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,198
If you panic now,

72
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,703
those who have ulterior motives will have the advantage.

73
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,245
Come. Over here.

74
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,254
Finish your revisions and rest early.

75
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,613
My lady, where did you get the lamp oil?

76
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,118
We visited all of the oil shops in the morning. We couldn't get any.

77
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,783
My lady, I wonder if you can sell us the lamp oil.

78
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,403
I only give them away. It's not for sale.

79
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,142
More oil will be arriving by tomorrow

80
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,343
so that you all can prepare for the exam.

81
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,302
Thank you, my lady.

82
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,906
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

83
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,449
You deal in plants and herbs. Where did you get the oil?

84
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,628
The flesh and skin of livestock

85
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,052
aren't the only materials that can produce oil.

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,023
There's oil floating on the surface of an aged Hundred Blossom Brew too.

87
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,327
I don't think the herbs and plants alone will produce enough oil.

88
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:15,103
We need at least 100 dou of oil

89
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,550
to supply all of these men for several days.

90
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,262
My men and I have tested out more than ten types of oil extraction methods.

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,103
I've found the best material for oil extraction.

92
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:25,799
You guys don't need to worry.

93
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,573
Don't fall behind.

94
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,266
It smells great.

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,663
Sesame and rapeseed, once roasted, produce oil.

96
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,077
The crops in Sheng County aren't ripe yet.

97
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,052
Therefore, I requested the villagers to pretend to be merchants

98
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,942
and bought all of the sesame and rapeseed in the city in batches.

99
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,102
Let's head over there.

100
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,588
Let's hold it together.

101
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,093
Put your back into it.

102
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,583
One, two, go.

103
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,103
One, two, go.

104
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,622
One, two, go.

105
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,783
One, two, go.

106
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,065
Look.

107
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,147
Is this the oil you delivered to them last night?

108
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,463
This oil is the same as oil extracted from livestocks.

109
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,662
Not only can we fuel oil lamps with it, but we can also cook with it.

110
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,582
It smells refreshing too.

111
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,423
I've tested all of the methods listed in ancient records.

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,862
I've crushed them, ground them, soaked them in water, and steamed them.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
But none of the methods yield as much oil as this method.

114
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,835
If we introduce this method to places where livestock is rare,

115
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:56,367
it'll be much easier for them to procure oil.

116
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:06,741
I'm strong.

117
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,851
Let me do it.

118
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:31,294
You're used to acting alone.

119
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,742
You think that you can resolve every issue by yourself.

120
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,862
But you can't extract the oil alone.

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,022
It doesn't matter how strong you are.

122
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,183
Even if you can lift a 100-jin rod by yourself,

123
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,457
you still need someone to guide the rod.

124
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,262
If not, your ten strikes

125
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:49,167
will pale in comparison to a joint strike.

126
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,239
Seems like you're always scheming to "put me in my place", aren't you?

127
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:53,659
All right.

128
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,862
Just be my guide.

129
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,516
I promise I'll hit the mark.

130
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,017
Enough already.

131
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,334
We've been doing it the entire day. Let's take a break.

132
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,752
I can arrange for someone to do such labor.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,463
Since when were you guys here?

134
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,782
When you said you'd hit the mark with her as your guide.

135
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,243
Lord Xu.

136
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,929
Have you guys visited the other workshops?

137
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,149
What do you guys think?

138
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,223
Mu Dan, it's all thanks to your meticulous thoughts.

139
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,742
Now, even if more scholars were to join our ranks,

140
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,356
we'll have enough oil supply for everyone.

141
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,051
Regarding the lamp oil, the less people know that it's Mu Dan's doing,

142
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,798
the safer you two will be.

143
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:52,677
Once the oil is transported to the city,

144
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,508
I'm willing to distribute it to the scholars.

145
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,463
You need to take the imperial exam. Do not waste your time.

146
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,281
I can do the same under the guise of a man. It won't be a problem.

147
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,888
I've taken the provincial exam nine years in a row.

148
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,361
I failed every time because the nobles monopolized the exam.

149
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,930
This time, Lord Jiang has given modest scholars a fighting chance.

150
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:12,814
I'm confident that I can pass with flying colors.

151
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,492
Dean Xu, Lord Jiang, I won't let you guys down.

152
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,926
True depth of thought comes from long-term growth and constant learning.

153
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,966
Zhang Qian is very knowledgeable.

154
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,321
I believe that you can surely pass with flying colors.

155
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,313
Thank you, teacher.

156
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,804
Anyone can distribute the oil as long as we can enter the city.

157
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,939
Right now, the city guards are all King Ning's men.

158
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,143
They inspect everyone strictly.

159
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,419
I'm afraid it'll be difficult to transport the oil

160
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:46,422
into the city.

161
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,544
I do have an idea.

162
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,270
I once worked at a tavern before.

163
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,858
I saw for myself that oil was less dense than liquor.

164
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,821
If we pour the oil into half-filled wine vats,

165
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:03,880
even if the guards were to inspect our cargo,

166
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,538
we just need to scoop the bottom and let them try the liquor.

167
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,779
Madam He is truly knowledgeable and meticulous. She's no inferior to a man.

168
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,195
Let me thank you on behalf of the scholars.

169
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,040
You flatter me.

170
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,240
One's gender doesn't matter when it comes to contributing to the state.

171
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,497
May you all remain devoted to your duties

172
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,301
and care for the people upon attaining office.

173
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,930
The future of the people of Sheng County depends on you all now.

174
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,464
It must've been tough all this while.

175
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,753
Jiang Chang Yang.

176
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:51,278
I wish to know all about your past.

177
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,729
No matter if they were joyful or sorrowful,

178
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,360
I want you to share them with me.

179
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,666
What do you wish to know? I'll tell you everything.

180
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,181
You said you overcame your doubts after the fire at Fang Garden.

181
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,278
What about the fire at Mengzhou?

182
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:17,082
You...

183
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,343
It was truly a tragedy.

184
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,203
I might not be able to get over it for the rest of my life.

185
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:28,671
King Ning has harmed plenty of people.

186
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,819
He thought a single blaze could burn away my loyal heart.

187
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,914
But he was wrong.

188
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:38,375
Due to that man-made accident,

189
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,870
I saw San Lang's true nature.

190
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,869
There was a fire because the Crown Prince was mischievous.

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,183
But now, they're blaming it on the people.

192
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,943
- How did the princess die in the fire?   - Wait.

193
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,622
Do you have a death wish?

194
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,196
Do you think the casualties aren't enough?

195
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,902
I just can't take this lying down.

196
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,022
The powerful and influential don't care about our lives at all.

197
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,142
Line up.

198
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,639
Don't rush. All of you will get it.

199
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,983
Come.

200
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:06,860
Line up.

201
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,037
- Madam, I'll give you extra.   - Thank you.

202
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,160
The porridge is ready.

203
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,502
Be careful. It's hot.

204
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,712
Everyone will get it.

205
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,298
Come.

206
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,757
Madam, be careful. It's hot.

207
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,223
- Okay.   - Those at the back.

208
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,423
Come and line up here.

209
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,703
Be careful.

210
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,063
Where did you get the grain?

211
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,063
I transported them urgently from the Eastern Palace's private stash.

212
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,037
- Here, be careful.   - Do you know this?

213
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,343
- Thank you.   - King Ning is spreading rumors about you.

214
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,584
The people are hating you...

215
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,787
Those who wear the crown must bear its weight.

216
00:14:40,176 --> 00:14:41,799
I must also bear the slander and scorn.

217
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,332
Right now, my priority is to help them settle down.

218
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,103
Here. Be careful.

219
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,699
Okay.

220
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,622
Join me.

221
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:56,178
Hurry.

222
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,080
Although it was San Lang's first time leaving the palace,

223
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,983
yet he had a thorough understanding of the people of Mengzhou.

224
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,406
It was clear that King Ning was holding him back.

225
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,056
Even so, he managed to find several just officials

226
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,213
to aid him in helping the disaster victims to settle down.

227
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,239
They'd rescued many of them.

228
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:24,583
So, you saw that San Lang had the form and perseverance of a wise ruler.

229
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,343
The people will only be able to lead stable lives

230
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,558
if he becomes the emperor.

231
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,099
That's right.

232
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,862
It was from that moment onward

233
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:34,495
that I've decided to step into politics.

234
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,662
If we follow the path of righteousness,

235
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,720
there's no need to fear any slander or scorn.

236
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,002
That's why even when people felt sorry for you,

237
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,063
you endured everything and thought nothing of it.

238
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,451
I once faced death alone. And now, I'm reborn.

239
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,133
I was so lucky to encounter you.

240
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,272
You know me, understand me,

241
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,542
and are willing to join me on my journey.

242
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,359
Let's work hard together.

243
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,423
One day, we'll definitely

244
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,343
witness a well-governed state where the people thrive.

245
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:33,078
Are these wine vats filled with oil?

246
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,440
That's right.

247
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,879
Here. Hold this.

248
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,062
Okay.

249
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,117
Use the same method to distribute the other vats.

250
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,488
Okay. Leave it to me.

251
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,662
Dear scholars, we have lamp oil now.

252
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,800
Come. Hand it to me.

253
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,463
- This is great.   - Look.

254
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,997
- Thank you.   - This is great.

255
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,141
Okay. Thank you.

256
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,805
- This is for you.   - Thank you.

257
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,100
Thank you.

258
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,303
It is said that he who moves with purpose must aid the Heaven

259
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,143
and stand beside the ruler shaped by Earth's grace.

260
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,502
As noble virtue approaches the supreme path,

261
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,917
an era of enlightened governance...

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,143
I'll reward you guys with jewelry and money.

263
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,423
Slowly.

264
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,036
Young Master, let me congratulate you in advance.

265
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,183
May you pass the exam with flying colors and rise through the ranks.

266
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,784
Here's your reward.

267
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,015
Thank you, Young Master.

268
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,564
Young Master Zhu.

269
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,213
We wanted to drink with you a few days ago. Why didn't you join us?

270
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,553
I have something to do.

271
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,148
Here he comes.

272
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,903
You are men of talent and learning,

273
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,383
who have come

274
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,183
a long way under recommendation.

275
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,822
Your trials are known.

276
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,542
Justice shall prevail.

277
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,262
No brilliance shall go unseen

278
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,062
May you all face your exam with composure.

279
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,223
Yes, My Lord.

280
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,825
Check the attendance.

281
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,280
Yes, My Lord.

282
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,863
Huang Qing Yun of Songzhou.

283
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,058
Qi Da of Haozhou.

284
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,062
Guys, I shall enter the exam hall first.

285
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,224
Zhu Qiong of the capital.

286
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,539
Sun Zhi of Mengzhou.

287
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,943
I'm Zhu Qiong, the son of the Minister of Agriculture.

288
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:53,758
Young Master Zhu.

289
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,157
Get me a single room that's warm and spacious.

290
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,863
Make sure the heating is functioning.

291
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,582
You wouldn't want me to fall sick due to the weather.

292
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,862
Yes, Young Master Zhu.

293
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,614
Here you go.

294
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,476
Zhang Song of Weizhou.

295
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:07,967
He reeks of liquor even before the exam.

296
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,236
Young Master Zhu is so sure that he can pass the exam, huh?

297
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,782
Ma Bing of the capital.

298
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,533
Everyone.

299
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,542
We studied hard for many years all for this moment.

300
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,069
Please think well before you write.

301
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,306
We mustn't hand over our great land to these idle sons of luxury.

302
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,516
- That's right.   - Indeed.

303
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,617
You're right.

304
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,680
Guys, let's do our best.

305
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,049
Let's do our best.

306
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,827
Liang Guan Wu.

307
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,040
Get up!

308
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,199
Get up!

309
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,171
My Lord, this is the set delivered by the Imperial Examination Hall.

310
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,703
It's the same question set delivered by Jiang Chang Yang.

311
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,406
Excellent.

312
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,796
This is great.

313
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:10,437
Come. Again.

314
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:11,763
One more round!

315
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,469
Do it!

316
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,157
It's on fire!

317
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,262
Young Master Zhu, hurry and wake up!

318
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,420
Wake up!

319
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,445
It's on fire!

320
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,158
- Someone!   - Young Master Zhu?

321
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,383
It's on fire!

322
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,342
I'm on fire!

323
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,062
Someone! Help me!

324
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,342
Hurry! Help me!

325
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,797
Someone! Put out the fire!

326
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,975
Put out the fire!

327
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:23,693
Hurry and put out the fire!

328
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,306
Hurry!

329
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,842
Have the candidates taken to the side hall

330
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:28,542
of the Secretariat for temporary refuge!

331
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,383
Request Marquis Wu for help!

332
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,342
Someone!

333
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,623
Due to the windy night, the spilled oil lamp started a fire.

334
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,582
The current affairs essay we previously composed has to be discarded.

335
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:45,923
The chief examiner has submitted the matter to His Majesty for instruction.

336
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:50,120
The Ministry of Rites has decided to come up with a new topic.

337
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:51,786
My Lord,

338
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,782
I'm afraid our previous plan has to...

339
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:14,663
This year's spring wind has arrived late.

340
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:19,649
But I never expected it to foil my plan like this.

341
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,918
Since when did you obtain the power to wield wind?

342
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,575
I planted my men in the Imperial Examination Hall.

343
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:43,167
I've tampered with the oil lamp as well.

344
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,432
A fire would break out as long as there was the slightest of wind.

345
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:47,536
Once one of their exam papers was burned down,

346
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,489
everyone has to retake the exam.

347
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,797
I suppose you had this all calculated out

348
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,903
when you stole the exam papers and delivered them to King Ning.

349
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,502
I have to win King Ning's trust.

350
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,703
However, I must also ensure the fairness of the imperial exam.

351
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,143
King Ning is a pretentious gentleman.

352
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,502
But he's no match for a pretentious crook like you.

353
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,400
It's windy out here. Your clothing is too thin.

354
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,169
I'm sure you're cold.

355
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm giving you a chance to embrace me.

356
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,198
You're my wife now.

357
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:28,087
I can embrace you whenever I feel like it.

358
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,183
You shouldn't catch a cold because of this.

359
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,676
Jiang Chang Yang.

360
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,125
You're doing this all because you know martial arts, huh?

361
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,384
Now, you know why I didn't teach you martial arts back then.

362
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,102
I was just afraid that you might dominate me in the future.

363
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,798
Jiang Chang Yang,

364
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,302
we've worked hard for the imperial exam for a long time.

365
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,060
Has everything finally come to fruition tonight?

366
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:02,713
All this while,

367
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,863
I'm sorry that you had to worry about the event with me.

368
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,902
Everything is fun when I'm together with you. It's not tough at all.

369
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,863
I finally managed to pinch you.

370
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,183
Jiang Chang Yang, let me go.

371
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,342
I think the questions are quite unexpected.

372
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,357
Yang, right now, we should relax.

373
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,436
Since we've put in a lot of effort, at least we can face ourselves.

374
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,502
- That's right.   - Zhang has a point.

375
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:11,763
Farewell.

376
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,561
Farewell.

377
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,317
Everyone, come.

378
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,822
Let's take a break here.

379
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,597
Let's have our meal before leaving.

380
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,756
- All right.   - Come.

381
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:29,933
- Over here.   - Okay.

382
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,071
Let's take a break.

383
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:35,910
Why are these peasants blocking my way?

384
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,979
Do you know who I am? How dare you obstruct my path?

385
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:42,454
Young Master, we don't need your instructions.

386
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,758
When we see a carriage like that, we'll make way no matter who's inside.

387
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,347
Wretched peasant, what do you know?

388
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,797
This carriage is made of rosewood.

389
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,236
Only a few of them exist in Chang'an, you know?

390
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,439
Let's take a break.

391
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,597
Mu Dan was being sarcastic just now. She was merely praising the carriage.

392
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,302
Even so, Zhu Qiong couldn't figure that out. He's such a fool.

393
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,952
The Minister of Agriculture wouldn't need to do all that just to

394
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,865
please King Ning if he weren't this ignorant in the first place.

395
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:22,756
Lord Jiang, I've already told the peasants to move.

396
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,240
You guys don't need to go through the trouble.

397
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,324
Mu Dan.

398
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,479
Sui Zhi?

399
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,401
This is Mu Dan, my beloved concubine.

400
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,102
His Majesty also appointed her as the Chief Flower Merchant of the State.

401
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:49,279
How was the hunt today?

402
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,038
The hunt went great today.

403
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,560
I'm returning to the city even though it's only been half a day.

404
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,926
I'm glad to hear that.

405
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,550
Since I've encountered my spouse, let's take a break.

406
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,423
Roast the deer we hunted for her.

407
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,008
Yes, My Lord.

408
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:06,524
Let's go.

409
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,760
Guys, please try the roasted deer together with us later.

410
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,196
All right.

411
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,597
Thank you, Madam He.

412
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,762
Tang.

413
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,784
The Flower Bird Envoy's concubine is already a wealthy merchant.

414
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:19,990
Why is she still delivering the goods personally?

415
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,196
Madam He's business wouldn't be booming

416
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,837
had she not done everything personally.

417
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,183
She even has branches in Sheng County now.

418
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,430
She's a delicate and beautiful lady.

419
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,824
She shows her face all day instead of staying at home to serve her family.

420
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,480
I suppose only Flower Bird Envoy would fall for her.

421
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:37,660
They're catching up over there. What are you trying to do?

422
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,942
Come. Let's go and grill some meat.

423
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,725
You went out to prepare your goods before dawn.

424
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:45,348
Why are you only leaving the city by now?

425
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,607
My men from Sheng County wrote to me that there was a rat infestation.

426
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,452
My trip was delayed as I went to buy some rat poison.

427
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:55,623
If so, you must clean your hands when you arrive at Sheng County.

428
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,236
You must be careful when you eat.

429
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,473
Got it.

430
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,191
What about you? You've been acting the entire day. I'm sure you're tired.

431
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:05,950
I did expend a lot of my mental energy

432
00:28:07,024 --> 00:28:08,368
trying to fish out information from fools.

433
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:14,143
Young Master Zhu is arrogant and petty.

434
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:18,228
I suppose he'll blame King Ning for poor arrangement if he fails the exam.

435
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,447
Before this, you said

436
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,241
that King Ning was backed by noble families.

437
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:27,262
Those in power now are sharp and wary. They cannot be bribed easily.

438
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,302
However, most of their children were spoiled.

439
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,068
Have you ever thought of targeting them?

440
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,110
You can persuade them to persuade their fathers

441
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,983
to stop supporting King Ning.

442
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,281
Was that a bad idea?

443
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,840
I'll stop, then. Let's go.

444
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,663
Although you're not in the imperial court, you have impressive insight.

445
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:54,871
You and I were thinking of the same thing.

446
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,768
Are you praising me? Or are you praising yourself?

447
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,463
We're a family. It's the same no matter who I praise.

448
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:12,278
I've only tried roseleaf raspberry liquor before.

449
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,645
I've never seen their flowers in bloom.

450
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,342
It truly looks like fragrant jade sashes and snowy tassels of silk.

451
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:38,088
Jiang Chang Yang,

452
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,703
I suppose we have gray hair together now.

453
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:47,356
I only hope that time can pass slower

454
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:51,223
for the rest of our lives.

455
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,884
We've been very busy after New Year's Day.

456
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:58,629
It's been so long since we had gone out together.

457
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,126
We would've missed out on this view

458
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,143
had we not encountered each other today.

459
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,782
We're doing everything for the sake of our future.

460
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:15,102
I'm already content that we can spend a moment together like this.

461
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,325
Wait!

462
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:39,799
Let me go!

463
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,183
You're making me giddy.

464
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:44,319
You even messed up the spring pancakes.

465
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:46,120
This doesn't look like your cooking.

466
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,302
The villagers gave them to me.

467
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:50,786
Don't let them go to waste. Try it.

468
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,589
It's pretty good.

469
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:00,173
But I crave the supper you make even more.

470
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,996
I've been busy in the morning and traveling in the afternoon.

471
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,494
You want me to make you some flatbreads?

472
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,157
I'm so tired that I can sleep here right now.

473
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,799
You were that busy, huh?

474
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,183
Why didn't you rest longer? You didn't need to rush back.

475
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,869
It's been some days since I've seen you.

476
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,887
I wanted to return early so that I could see you.

477
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,223
If so, I'll grant you your wish. You may sleep here now.

478
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,194
Enough already. Stop messing around.

479
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,543
Did you rush to me upon returning to the residence?

480
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,994
Look at how sweaty you are. You didn't even wipe your sweat.

481
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,461
How was it over there? Was it tough?

482
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,363
Everything felt fine to me as long as I knew

483
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:41,214
that you were waiting for me at home.

484
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:48,167
I think you had a rougher time.

485
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,223
Why don't we take a bath together and relax for a while?

486
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:54,943
Dear, you may go first.

487
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,477
I have something for you. I'll hand it to you later.

488
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,703
I lack nothing.

489
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,469
We only ever find each other as the sun sets.

490
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,746
I can't bear to part with you again.

491
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:07,570
Wait...

492
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,609
Good girl, you shouldn't eat that.

493
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:13,850
Come.

494
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,409
I'll feed you some dried fish, okay?

495
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,135
Even a cat receives better treatment than me.

496
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,628
Why are you jealous of a cat?

497
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,231
All right now. I'll look for you after feeding it.

498
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,382
Let's go.

499
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,589
Let's go.

500
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:06,087
You said you had something for me. Was it this outfit?

501
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,468
That's right.

502
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,472
I sewed this garment for you myself.

503
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,922
You should try it on later and see if it fits you.

504
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:29,665
Magistrate Yu said he wanted to establish a chicken pen.

505
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,434
However, what troubles people is not scarcity, but inequality.

506
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,568
He doesn't know who he should give the business to.

507
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,948
I intend to allow open self-recommendation.

508
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,697
Those who wish to do the trade may come to Chang'an for training.

509
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:45,808
They can compete according to the abilities.

510
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:47,422
If they do a good job,

511
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,790
they can do what I, Da Fu, and Xiao Chun did.

512
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,719
They can form a partnership and sign an agreement.

513
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:53,976
What do you think?

514
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:56,815
Although the three of you may be united,

515
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:59,255
that doesn't mean outsiders will do the same.

516
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,562
You do have a point.

517
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:06,035
Some people are hardworking while some are lazy.

518
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,343
A conflict is bound to occur when it comes to profit-sharing.

519
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:14,039
I can have Magistrate Yu appoint someone as inspector.

520
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,290
As for the agreement, it shouldn't be too long either.

521
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:18,469
Six months is enough.

522
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:21,383
If it doesn't work out, they can change their partners.

523
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:23,614
We finally have time to relax.

524
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,335
Can you please take a break?

525
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,282
Are you jealous?

526
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,664
I just want you to give yourself a moment of relaxation

527
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,242
and admire the view in front of us.

528
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:39,142
One will only have the energy to continue working if they rest well.

529
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,619
It's great to have you here.

530
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,609
Dear, are you referring to the moon?

531
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,159
Or are you referring to me?

532
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:56,656
What do you think?

533
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:44,175
I learned a magic trick.

534
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,600
I can pick the stars for you.

535
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:49,385
Really?

536
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:56,015
Count to three, and the stars will appear.

537
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,292
Okay.

538
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,556
All done.

539
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:17,108
Chuan Yu is behind this magic trick of yours, right?

540
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,613
Wrong.

541
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,017
It's She Yan.

542
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:22,664
Something's off.

543
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:26,301
You were busy today, yet you prepared all this for me.

544
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,959
Did you do something bad behind my back?

545
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:31,047
You hit the nail on the coffin.

546
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:40,186
I'm very ashamed.

547
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,159
In the past, I wasn't as brave as you.

548
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:46,895
You devoted so much effort just to approach me.

549
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:52,500
I wish to make it up to you for the days I've wasted.

550
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,105
All right now.

551
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,702
I'm very magnanimous. I don't hold grudges.

552
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,647
As we walk through

553
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:11,441
a thousand steps of this endless world,

554
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:14,616
we shall never be separated.

555
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:32,479
We've enjoyed fireworks twice.

556
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:35,351
And, I broke your heart twice.

557
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,065
I have to make it up to you.

558
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:43,433
This way, whenever you see fireworks again,

559
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,335
you'll only remember the joyous moment we had tonight.

560
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,142
This time, I'm sure Chuan Yu is behind this.

561
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,612
Dear, you're observant indeed.

562
00:37:58,991 --> 00:38:00,695
I'm sure Chuan Yu had a long day as well.

563
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,823
You should let him return and rest.

564
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:06,600
How would you know that Chuan Yu didn't set the fireworks

565
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,423
for him to enjoy it with Da Fu?

566
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,962
Look!

567
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,334
Everything's fine.

568
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,326
Look!

569
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,622
The fourth son of Liu is actually on the list?

570
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,263
I think I should take the exam again next year.

571
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,303
My name's on the list!

572
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:22,776
I've studied hard for ten years!

573
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,629
My name is finally on the list!

574
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:30,615
Zhang Qian?

575
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:31,758
Congratulations, Zhang.

576
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,182
Zhang, you came in first place.

577
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,340
- Congratulations, Zhang.   - Congratulations, Zhang.

578
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,158
- Congratulations.   - Thank you.

579
00:39:36,904 --> 00:39:39,863
During the uprising, as the top scholar,

580
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:42,255
Zhang Qian can rally the scholars to denounce the traitorous,

581
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,248
and thus spark a fire that shall sweep across the land.

582
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,743
Zhang Qian is meticulous and talented.

583
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:50,133
Your Majesty, have it ever occurred to you

584
00:39:50,214 --> 00:39:52,240
that he should take up more positions?

585
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:54,920
Vice Minister Ma, you only met him once at the Qu River Banquet,

586
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:57,686
and now, you're requesting him from His Majesty?

587
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:01,149
Minister Zhang was stripped of his position.

588
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,014
The Ministry of War has undergone a purge.

589
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:05,125
Now, there are several vacancies.

590
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,354
Naturally, I need a capable assistant.

591
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:11,711
The scholars are still new to the world.

592
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,497
They're only well-versed in the teachings of ancient sages.

593
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:18,213
He must first be seasoned before he can take on weighty tasks.

594
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:20,519
Sui Zhi has a point.

595
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:24,102
I shall assign Zhang Qian to the prefectural office for two years.

596
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,120
As long as he stays true to his character, I'll reserve him for you

597
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,622
when he returns to the capital after two years.

598
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

599
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,405
Spare the formalities.

600
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,903
Minister Zhang of the Ministry of War was a cautious person.

601
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:44,868
How exactly did Sui Zhi manage to procure evidence of his corruption?

602
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:48,622
He doted excessively on his fourth son, who was born to him late in life.

603
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,614
His son was also good friends with the Minister of Agriculture's son.

604
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,307
He spilled everything after getting drunk.

605
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,896
Minister Zhang has five mistresses.

606
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,639
He kept all of the accounts and dirty money

607
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,420
in the residence of the mistress he liked the least.

608
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:07,595
What a complicated game this is.

609
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:09,320
To think that you're patient enough to plan your moves.

610
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,703
When it comes to the privacy and dirty deeds of corrupt officials,

611
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:17,222
there's nothing that Sui Zhi cannot uncover.
