1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,000
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,880
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,715
Why have we stopped?

4
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,079
This is the government's courier route.

5
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,439
How dare you cause trouble?

6
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,116
Stop talking nonsense.

7
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,996
- This is bad. Bandits.   - Attack them!

8
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,270
My flowers!

9
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,253
- Mu Dan!   - This is...

10
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,332
- Are you the one in charge?   - Yes.

11
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,796
Misters, what's this about?

12
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,076
Let's talk it out.

13
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,697
Don't hurt my people and my flowers.

14
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:25,929
What flowers?

15
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,040
My family of seven can't even afford to eat

16
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
but all of you are protecting
a few stalks of flowers?

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,875
Take them all away!

18
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,574
- Take them away!   - Move.

19
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,068
- Let's go.   - Go inside.

20
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,556
Even His Lordship

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,359
has sent a gift to you on
your birthday, Minister Zheng.

22
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,679
Minister, it's obvious

23
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,556
that you are being
appreciated by His Lordship.

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,396
Not at all.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,880
His Lordship is showing me respect.

26
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,875
I accepted the gift with reverence and awe.

27
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,516
In the future,

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,996
I need to serve the imperial court

29
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,915
and share His Majesty's burden.

30
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,480
Minister Zheng is noble
and is a man of integrity.

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,875
I'm impressed.

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,566
I hope

33
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,563
you can lend me a helping hand more often.

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,595
Of course.

35
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,796
Why hasn't Lord Jiang returned yet?

36
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,635
Did he get drunk and end up getting lost?

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,399
I saw the Flower Bird
Envoy drink a few cups.

38
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,595
He seems quite drunk.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,475
Perhaps he is trying to sober himself
in the arms of a beautiful woman.

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,956
Seriously.

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,760
- Come on.   - Let's drink!

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,195
- A toast to the minister.   - All right.

43
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,719
She Yan found out

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,559
that the gift list and ledgers

45
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,595
were hidden in a secret
compartment in the study.

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,835
Minister Zheng!

47
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,079
Lord Jiang.

48
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,075
Let me offer you a toast.

49
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,875
Lord Jiang, you are drunk.

50
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,515
Am I drunk?

51
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:49,395
Where am I?

52
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,178
Young Master.

53
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:53,586
Young Master.

54
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,720
Why are you here?

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,435
The minister is looking for you.

56
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,156
Today is Minister Zheng's birthday.

57
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,835
How can I behave so improperly?

58
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,156
Help me apologize to the minister.

59
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,075
I can't hold my liquor

60
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,116
so I'll be leaving first.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,275
Be careful, Young Master.

62
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,395
That was close.

63
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,916
Zheng is a cautious man.

64
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,635
He even set up traps in the study.

65
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,236
Traps? Are you hurt, Lord Jiang?

66
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,598
I...

67
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,530
Is this the Flower Bird
Envoy's horse carriage?

68
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,163
Indeed.

69
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,367
How did you find me here?

70
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:52,855
The servant of the Jiang Residence told me

71
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,075
you came to attend the Minister
of Revenue's birthday banquet.

72
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,107
Why are you looking
for me so late at night?

73
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,496
Something happened to Mu Dan.

74
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:01,916
Get on the carriage and tell me about it.

75
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,195
Mu Dan led a convoy and it was robbed.

76
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,046
This was brought back
by the shop's employee.

77
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,996
The bandits asked us to
bring a ransom of 200 guan.

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,515
The employee is bringing money to the hill

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,515
but I'm worried that the
bandits might be dishonest.

80
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,075
What if they take the money
and do not release them?

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,515
Your body can't handle traveling at night.

82
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,217
Get off at the
post house in front.

83
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:35,772
No.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,755
If you leave me here, I'll
go look for Mu Dan myself.

85
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,755
Don't worry. I won't cause
trouble when we arrive.

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,435
If we encounter any danger,

87
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,716
I'll hide and inform Chuan Yu.

88
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,556
Hold tight if you don't want to fall.

89
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,435
You are hurt.

90
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,671
It's a small wound.

91
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,553
I'm fine.

92
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,983
The bandits agreed to meet at
the courier route's stone tablet.

93
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,480
Why are we getting off here?

94
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,395
Sheng County is not far from Chang'an.

95
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,236
There are no capable bandits around.

96
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,716
They might be local farmers or hunters.

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,275
The agreed meeting place
won't be too far from their hideout.

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,275
This is the only inhabited village

99
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,395
located ten li from the stone tablet.

100
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,966
Who is it?

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,481
No. It's a misunderstanding.

102
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,755
Put your knife down.

103
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,373
Put it down. Put down your blade.

104
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,515
Why are you here?

105
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,119
Didn't you receive my second letter?

106
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,852
Weren't you kidnapped by bandits?

107
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,195
What's going on?

108
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,999
It's all a misunderstanding.
They are not bandits.

109
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,236
Why were you shouting
with your eyes all red?

110
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,259
I was starting a fire and
the smoke got into my eyes.

111
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,803
You rushed here throughout the
night. What if your illness returns?

112
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,076
I'll get Xiao Chun to examine you later.

113
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm fine.

114
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:44,755
Lord Jiang

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
might bleed out

116
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,675
if he isn't treated.

117
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,812
Why do you bleed so much? You...

118
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,836
I thought I wouldn't see you anymore.

119
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,236
It's fine now.

120
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,956
I'm fine.

121
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,196
You are bleeding so much.

122
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,635
Let me take a look at
your wound, all right?

123
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,915
You said

124
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,635
if you are in danger,

125
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,515
you will send me back to Chang'an

126
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,275
but when I'm alone,

127
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,316
I'll encounter danger

128
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,187
no matter where I am.

129
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,476
In that case,

130
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,035
isn't staying by your side

131
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,275
makes you feel more secure?

132
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,875
Madam He, you are amazing.

133
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,915
You don't need other people to save you.

134
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,836
Every time I arrive,

135
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,356
you've already brought
the situation under control.

136
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,356
If you know how amazing I am,

137
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,679
why do you rush to save me

138
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,836
again and again?

139
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:32,675
Jiang Chang Yang!

140
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,520
After applying medicine to the wound,

141
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,716
there won't be any problem.

142
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,760
However, he has a high fever

143
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,035
because his wound is infected.

144
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,755
Right now, the village lacks herbs.

145
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,354
I'm afraid

146
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,286
he has to get through
this on his own tonight.

147
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,755
If his fever subsides in the morning,

148
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,635
he will be safe.

149
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,604
Xiao Chun.

150
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,438
There are still many
patients in the village

151
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:13,800
waiting for you to take care of them.

152
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,476
After you suture his wound, you may leave.

153
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,115
Just leave this to me.

154
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,263
All right.

155
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,635
It's a fake marriage.

156
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Why are you doing this?

157
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,996
I'm just helping you bring the fever down.

158
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,275
Don't misunderstand.

159
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,316
Why does the person in my dream

160
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,076
seem so real?

161
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,555
Beautiful dreams

162
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,716
are all like this.

163
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,436
Don't go.

164
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,875
I'm not leaving.

165
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,275
I've never thought about leaving.

166
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,196
Show me your tongue.

167
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,076
As expected of the Flower Bird Envoy.

168
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,719
You take care of your body usually

169
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,875
so you recover faster
compared to other people.

170
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,116
I told you I was fine.

171
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,079
The high fever has subsided
but it might come back again.

172
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,596
You mustn't be careless.

173
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,250
You can only move around

174
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:06,795
after the poison caused by the
arrow injury is cleared from your body.

175
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,413
Listen to Xiao Chun.

176
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,088
Give it to me.

177
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,759
I can do it myself.

178
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,316
Listen to Xiao Chun.

179
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,371
If you tear your wound,

180
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:21,875
you'll need to trouble Xiao Chun again.

181
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,358
Xiao Chun has many
patients to take care of.

182
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:25,635
She can't strain herself anymore.

183
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,093
- Patients?   - Yes.

184
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,275
Don't you want to know

185
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,040
what happened

186
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,275
after we got kidnapped?

187
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,804
If I tell you,

188
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,555
you mustn't act violently.

189
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,767
Tell me.

190
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:47,846
The two people

191
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,035
you met last night

192
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,596
were the bandits who robbed us.

193
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,476
After we got robbed

194
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:58,760
that day...

195
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,755
- Faster!   - Move!

196
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,915
They threatened to chop off my hands

197
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,436
and forced me to write
a letter to Fang Garden

198
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,035
to ask for a ransom.

199
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,372
- Da Fu.   - Mu Dan.

200
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:30,653
Xiao Chun.

201
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
When Da Fu, Xiao Chun, and I

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,835
were preparing to escape,

203
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:39,320
we realized

204
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,755
we weren't in a bandit's hideout.

205
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,115
The bandits

206
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,115
weren't bandits at all.

207
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:48,321
They got sick due to a plague

208
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,458
and had nowhere to go.

209
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,275
In order to survive,

210
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,676
they had no choice but
to rob the courier route.

211
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,515
When I saw the children

212
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,800
who were starving and
didn't have clothes to wear,

213
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,759
I had no way

214
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,315
to ignore them.

215
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
So,

216
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,156
we decided not to escape

217
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,835
and stay here

218
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,315
to treat them.

219
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,755
All the villagers are passionate people.

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,196
They were grateful after they
learned about our decision.

221
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,075
So, I sent another letter

222
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,476
to inform Fang Garden of my safety.

223
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:24,756
I didn't expect

224
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,515
Liu Lang to be so quick.

225
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,877
He brought you here

226
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:29,435
before the letter was sent to Fang Garden.

227
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,315
Thankfully, the bandits were fake.

228
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,560
If you entered a hideout

229
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,880
and got caught

230
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,115
for escaping,

231
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,795
your hands would be chopped off.

232
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,996
Real bandits want money as well.

233
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,035
Mu Dan is good at making money.

234
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,472
With her silver tongue,

235
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,560
she won't let bandits chop off...

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,035
Just drink your porridge.

237
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,360
Anyway, Da Fu ended up
becoming friends with them.

238
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,755
They are basically buddies.

239
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,204
Why haven't I seen Da Fu until now?

240
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:04,742
Xiao Chun and I noticed

241
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:06,160
that the illness of the patients here

242
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,835
is similar to the plague
from four years ago.

243
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,595
The medicine requires peonies

244
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,519
so I sent Da Fu

245
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,315
back to Fang Garden to bring the flowers.

246
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,636
She should be back today.

247
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,476
I haven't asked about you.

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,636
Why were you wounded?

249
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,494
I was careless when I worked for San Lang.

250
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,476
Don't you have the Golden Thread Armor?

251
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,075
Courtesans would be present
at a colleague's family banquet.

252
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,759
If they touched me and noticed it,

253
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,916
it'd be bad.

254
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,355
It seems like you are quite immersed

255
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,555
in your act.

256
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,676
It's all because you
left without a farewell

257
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,835
and let me attend the banquet alone.

258
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,039
What's wrong? Did you tear your wound?

259
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,075
Let me see. I hope it doesn't bleed.

260
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:20,941
Mu Dan.

261
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,355
When did you leave last night?

262
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,716
The fever left me in a daze.

263
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,676
I hope I didn't say any nonsense.

264
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,906
Your fever subsided

265
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,668
after you were covered
with a few pieces of cloth.

266
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,916
Before I left,

267
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,676
you were passed out.

268
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,396
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

269
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:57,852
It's nothing.

270
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,676
I remember how cold
the cloth was last night

271
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,315
and simply mentioned it.

272
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,835
Lord Jiang, shouldn't you rest in bed?

273
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Why did you come out?

274
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,755
When have you cared about me so much?

275
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,355
I only listened to Mu Dan's orders.

276
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:00,676
Did Mu Dan

277
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,515
see the blood on the saddle?

278
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,937
She didn't.

279
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,716
What is Mu Dan doing?

280
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,636
She went to the village
entrance to welcome Da Fu.

281
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,139
Let's go and take a look.

282
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,898
Do you have something to say?

283
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,515
I was the one

284
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,073
who broke the white jade
hairpin Mu Dan gave you.

285
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,315
After the fire at Fang Garden,

286
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,476
Mu Dan only had eyes for you.

287
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,835
I was jealous and made a mistake.

288
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,133
Sorry.

289
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,075
Why do you tell me this today?

290
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,115
To save Mu Dan,

291
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,315
you got hurt and bled a lot.

292
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,156
However, you still rode here at night

293
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,571
without a complaint.

294
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,360
You passed out for one night and
the first thing you said after waking up

295
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,555
was to ask me to clean
the bloodstained saddle

296
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,355
so Mu Dan wouldn't feel guilty.

297
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,436
Your feelings for Mu Dan are true

298
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,400
and you have the ability

299
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,595
to protect her.

300
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,355
I don't want you two to grow distant

301
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,996
because of me.

302
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,515
Mu Dan's care for you isn't in vain.

303
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,636
Your care for her is sincere as well.

304
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:29,876
Don't worry.

305
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,595
I won't tell her about this.

306
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,236
You don't mind that I have feelings

307
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,115
for Mu Dan?

308
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,835
Mu Dan treated you

309
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,723
and taught you to read.

310
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,922
She treats you well without
asking anything in return.

311
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,436
It's very normal for you

312
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,396
to want to have her for yourself.

313
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:56,365
However, this is not love
between a man and a woman.

314
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,476
It's admiration

315
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,315
towards a family member.

316
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,275
Since Mu Dan sees you
as her younger brother,

317
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,035
she will educate you

318
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,956
even after you make a mistake

319
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,115
and not chase you away.

320
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,396
Don't be restless over what might happen.

321
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,996
Fang Yuan will always be your home.

322
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:19,260
Mu Dan

323
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,555
will always be your sister.

324
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,402
- Here, Zhao.   - I want one.

325
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,040
I met Da Fu on my way here

326
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,472
and found out what happened.

327
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:39,941
Compared to money, the
villagers need food and medicine.

328
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,935
So, I brought everything we
have at the residence here.

329
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,663
Not bad, Chuan Yu.

330
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm sure they'll want to be your
buddy when they see all these.

331
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,703
Let's go. I'll introduce
you to my sworn brother.

332
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,406
I don't want to be your
sworn brother's buddy.

333
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:50,882
- Do you want this?   - Why?

334
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,487
I...

335
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:52,880
Are you putting
yourself on a pedestal?

336
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,358
No.

337
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,600
Are you acting
all high and mighty?

338
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,807
Are you looking down on them?

339
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:56,360
I'm not...

340
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,840
Chuan Yu, your Young Master is hurt.

341
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,156
Go and see him.

342
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:02,380
Yes.

343
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,676
I'll introduce you to him later!

344
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,984
Have you sent someone to
our customers at Dingyulouxue?

345
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,326
I asked our employees to send
the peonies and money there.

346
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,400
That's good to hear.

347
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,000
- Is it delicious?   - Yes.

348
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,355
Who are all of you?

349
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,075
What are you transporting?

350
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,755
County Magistrate, we are
flower merchants who passed by.

351
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:34,801
We found out there was a plague
here and they lacked food and clothing.

352
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,400
So, we brought some food

353
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,876
and medicine to help them.

354
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:40,970
Merchants always prioritize
profits over righteousness.

355
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,996
You are not related

356
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,239
to the people of Sheng County.

357
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,595
Why are you showing such kindness?

358
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,999
Are you trying to kidnap the children

359
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,156
and sell the people?

360
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,384
Someone, tie them up!

361
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,305
You're an official, why are you barking...

362
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,847
County Magistrate, please investigate it.

363
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,880
If I want to kidnap the children,

364
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,115
I should bring maltose
and fruits to attract them.

365
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,196
County Magistrate, you can

366
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:03,880
investigate the goods
on the horse carriage.

367
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,560
No kidnappers would kidnap someone

368
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,156
with peonies and all these.

369
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,714
- Check the goods.   - Yes!

370
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:11,950
County Magistrate!

371
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,363
- Magistrate Yu!   - Village Elder.

372
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,643
- Village Elder.   - Village Elder.

373
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,012
Madam He did come
here to deliver us medicine.

374
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,806
Zhao and her mother have
recovered. Right, Zhao?

375
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,595
Is there

376
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,315
such an affluent female shopowner?

377
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,956
Blooming Abode is famous in Chang'an.

378
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,882
Do you know what title His
Majesty granted Mu Dan?

379
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,840
The Chief Flower Merchant of the State.

380
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,384
He even wrote the words
"Peerless Youthful Beauty" for her.

381
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,603
It's at Fang Garden. Let me
bring you there and show it to you.

382
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:43,824
You've met His Majesty before?

383
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,035
County Magistrate, we
don't mean anything bad.

384
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,795
You asked me why I want
to save these villagers.

385
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,396
Being a merchant as a woman is difficult.

386
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,719
I received a lot of help

387
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,519
from people who weren't
my family or friends

388
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:58,755
along the way.

389
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,236
Heaven is impartial and
always blesses kind people.

390
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,880
You are educated

391
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,400
and the magistrate of a county.

392
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,956
I'm sure you can understand this.

393
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,755
Of course, I understand.

394
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,315
I only cared about my people just now.

395
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,716
There's no problem with
carrying out kind deeds

396
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,996
but you need to inform me beforehand.

397
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,835
People's lives are at stake
when you treat a plague.

398
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,595
If you kill someone accidentally,

399
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,916
I have to deal with your mess as well.

400
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,476
If he cared about the people,

401
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,332
we wouldn't be standing here today.

402
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,914
What do you mean?

403
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:33,906
Are you saying that
I've neglected my duties?

404
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:34,453
Yes!

405
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,439
You won't even let your people complain?

406
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,561
County Magistrate,
she's young and reckless.

407
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,800
Please spare her.

408
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,111
How is she young when she looks like this?

409
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,516
- Take her away!   - Yes!

410
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,656
I'll show you what kind of official I am.

411
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,679
County Magistrate, you are magnanimous.

412
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,080
Please don't mind

413
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,315
Da Fu's words.

414
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,559
County Magistrate, she...

415
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,999
She might look like this but
her head is very confused.

416
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,360
She doesn't even understand

417
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,555
what you are talking about.

418
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,355
Well, let me go with you.

419
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,682
You can't go.

420
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,213
I scolded you. You can
punish me all you want.

421
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,921
- Take her away!   - Yes!

422
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:06,515
No!

423
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,959
- Miss!   - Da Fu!

424
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,555
- Miss!   - County Magistrate!

425
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,199
- Da Fu!   - Miss Da Fu!

426
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,956
Come back! Zhao, bring
your siblings back home.

427
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:18,359
Village Elder, get someone
to move these things back.

428
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,945
We'll be back
soon. Don't worry.

429
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:20,564
All right.

430
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,015
Da Fu!

431
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Look around.

432
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,315
Look around!

433
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,075
The county's granary is so empty

434
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
that there's not even a mouse

435
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,413
let alone money to buy medicine.

436
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,795
Do you think I don't
want to be a good official?

437
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,177
I've never heard of

438
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,560
a locust plague or a flood in Sheng County.

439
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,996
Where is the money and grain?

440
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,595
Cruel governance is worse than a tiger.

441
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,560
The money and grain

442
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,436
were probably embezzled by his superiors.

443
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,555
I also came from a poor
family and studied hard.

444
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:55,267
I thought I could help the people
of a place after becoming an official.

445
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,195
However,

446
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,716
I'm worse than you women.

447
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
I've always thought

448
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,236
officials were mighty.

449
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,959
I didn't expect how bad their
lives were compared to ours.

450
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,595
when they are being oppressed
by officials who are more powerful.

451
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,944
With the current affairs,

452
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,633
it's tough being a commoner and a merchant.

453
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,148
It's also tough to become an official.

454
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,013
If you want fairness
and peace for everyone,

455
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,235
it's impossible for Magistrate Yu

456
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,236
and all of us.

457
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,876
In that case,

458
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,676
are you saying that it's hopeless?

459
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,779
No.

460
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,835
There's a group of people in this world

461
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,676
who have the ambition

462
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,840
to create a peaceful world

463
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,156
for the people.

464
00:30:06,646 --> 00:30:07,667
Here.

465
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,212
Be careful with it.

466
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,916
Thank you.

467
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,315
Thank you.

468
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,413
- Be careful.   - Thank you.

469
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,956
Drink it slowly. There's no rush.

470
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,645
Look.

471
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,996
This piece of land can be used.

472
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,236
Madam, the soil here is
suitable for growing sesame.

473
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,840
Liu Lang. Da Fu. Go and look elsewhere

474
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,916
and see if there are other types of soil.

475
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:03,937
Hurry!

476
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,052
- It's just as Mu Dan said.   - Yes.

477
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,375
Hold yourself up.

478
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,578
It's done.

479
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:29,052
One!

480
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,662
Two!

481
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:32,410
Three!

482
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:33,975
Four!

483
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,916
All right. Squat down.

484
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:39,787
This won't do.

485
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,755
Greetings, Flower Bird Envoy.

486
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,355
Here. Let me help you.

487
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,572
- I can do it.   - Let's go.

488
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:17,740
Who is it?

489
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,413
Who's acting mysterious
over there? Come out!

490
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,945
Who...

491
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,075
Jiang Chang Yang?

492
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,074
You've been working hard the whole day

493
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,295
so I'm trying to wake you up.

494
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,637
Why are you scaring me at night

495
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,039
instead of recuperating?

496
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,396
You are even carrying a cloak.

497
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:37,795
Since it's going to rain
and everyone is busy,

498
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,135
I'm the only one who's free to come.

499
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,996
I can only find this in the village.

500
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,600
How can a cloak

501
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,396
cover both of us?

502
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:47,990
Besides, even if it rains later,

503
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,560
you should be the one who wears the cloak.

504
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,115
Let's go. I've almost recovered.

505
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,391
If you fall sick and
can't treat the villagers,

506
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,645
I'll become a sinner.

507
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:58,998
Enough. If you keep
talking, it'll rain for real.

508
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,476
I'm healthier than you now.

509
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,595
- This way.   - Fine.

510
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,236
Even the stars have come out.

511
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,115
I don't think it will rain tonight.

512
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,653
- Let's take a break here.   - All right.

513
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,315
You've become more cheerful

514
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,795
compared to when you were in Chang'an.

515
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:50,347
When I started breaking stalks of peonies

516
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,716
and saving lives,

517
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,730
I finally figured it out.

518
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,315
When I found out about
what happened to Mother,

519
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,595
I was dejected

520
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,075
and felt hopeless.

521
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,956
However, after coming to Sheng County,

522
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,436
I changed my mind.

523
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,916
Good and evil are
separated by one's thoughts.

524
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,195
Peonies were used as poison back then

525
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,916
but they can be used as an antidote now.

526
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,360
Mother did not save the people

527
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,920
who were afflicted by the plague

528
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and died with regret.

529
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,519
I will make up

530
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,476
for her regrets in the future.

531
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,155
I will use the money I
make from my business

532
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,075
to help more people.

533
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,595
Then, Mr. Wu...

534
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,515
All this while,

535
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,195
there have been two voices in my heart.

536
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,195
One of the voices tells me

537
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,155
that you'll reap what you sow.

538
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,115
I hope Mr. Wu

539
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,515
will never come out of his trauma.

540
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,035
However, another voice keeps telling me

541
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,595
that Mr. Wu is also a victim.

542
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,155
Sometimes, it's hard to decide

543
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,436
whether to forgive or punish someone.

544
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,715
I can only say

545
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,675
that it all stems from natural disasters

546
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,675
and the injustice of the world.

547
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,796
I can't hate him

548
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,115
but I also can't forgive him.

549
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,115
Since Mother decided
to let him go back then,

550
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,996
I won't go against my mother's wish.

551
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,796
I think Mother

552
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,356
didn't want to see me
punish myself this way.

553
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,831
What I can do is

554
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,235
to think about how I should walk

555
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,436
the path of my future.

556
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:04,796
After treating the villagers

557
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,476
and returning to Chang'an,

558
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,956
you won't close Fang Garden anymore, right?

559
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,276
People look down on merchants

560
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,235
and think they only prioritize profits.

561
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,715
I want to learn from my father

562
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,234
and do my best

563
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:23,284
to change people's opinions on merchants

564
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,996
and let everyone know

565
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,836
that studying is not the only
way to repay your country

566
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,555
but you can do the same
by being a merchant as well.

567
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,316
Do you know

568
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,916
that this is a difficult path?

569
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,115
When I see the empty
granary of Sheng County

570
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,595
and heard the county
magistrate's helpless sigh,

571
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,316
I knew it.

572
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,675
Magistrate Yu might not be a good official

573
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,715
but he doesn't embezzle
funds using his power.

574
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,635
His superior is part
of King Ning's faction.

575
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:02,603
They lied to their
superiors and subordinates

576
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,436
while restricting the imperial
court's tax exemption measures.

577
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,796
It has caused trouble

578
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,762
to the surrounding counties of Chang'an.

579
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,276
Even if ants do their best,

580
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,996
there's still a limit to the
people they can save.

581
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,155
Only when the people in power

582
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,396
cherish the people's lives

583
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,880
can we not become ants

584
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,111
and live peacefully in the world

585
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,675
as humans.

586
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:35,396
Jiang Chang Yang.

587
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,476
Your ambition will also be my wish

588
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,235
from today onward.

589
00:37:42,591 --> 00:37:44,075
I'm doing this not because of you.

590
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,967
I want to support His Majesty, who
cares about the country and its people.

591
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,476
The people can only live peacefully

592
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:52,316
without corruption.

593
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,075
Then, I can let ordinary people

594
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,396
witness the beauty of peonies.

595
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,017
Look.

596
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,035
This is Sanqi Grass.

597
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,073
Thanks to your heavy bleeding,

598
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,595
Xiao Chun found it accidentally
in the forests of Sheng County.

599
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,235
You want the villagers to
make a living out of this?

600
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,663
There are various herbs
in the hills of Sheng County.

601
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:26,228
If they learn how to distinguish them,

602
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,756
they can gather the herbs and sell them.

603
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,276
This can help relieve the
villagers' livelihood temporarily.

604
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:33,155
However,

605
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,956
teaching people how to fish
is better than giving them fish.

606
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,515
I still need to think about

607
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,555
how they can make money.

608
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,956
I think

609
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,675
you are not just going
to recreate their livelihood

610
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,476
but you're also trying
to raise more merchants

611
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,836
who can make more money with you.

612
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
Miss, for you.

613
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,560
Thank you.

614
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,806
- Here you go.   - Thank you.

615
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,639
Miss Mu Dan.

616
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,360
What is this, Zhao?

617
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,479
I sculpted a deity figure

618
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,756
for all of you.

619
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,035
Did you sculpt this using
Mu Dan as a reference?

620
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,996
The eyes are Miss Mu Dan's.

621
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,075
The body is Miss Xiao Chun's.

622
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,436
The fists are Miss Da Fu's.

623
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,759
Thank you, Zhao. You are good at sculpting.

624
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,320
We like it a lot.

625
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,639
When all of you leave,

626
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,477
I'm going to put it in the temple.

627
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:37,360
I hope all of you can be safe

628
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,436
and I hope all of you can bless
my mother from getting ill again.

629
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:42,478
Zhao.

630
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,687
Did you pray to the deities
when your mother was ill?

631
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:46,612
I did.

632
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,436
Has your mother been treated?

633
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,756
Not yet. But all of you are here.

634
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:53,692
Zhao.

635
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:55,595
The deities

636
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,276
are high and far away in heaven.

637
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,436
Many people pray to it every day.

638
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,235
It might not hear you.

639
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,555
We also have our homes

640
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,836
and can't stay here all the time.

641
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,360
Instead of asking for help
from people and deities,

642
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,595
it's better to help yourself.

643
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,115
Help myself?

644
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,356
But I know nothing.

645
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,200
If you learn,

646
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,035
you will learn a skill sooner or later.

647
00:40:16,786 --> 00:40:17,813
Zhao,

648
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,519
you can only protect
yourself and your family

649
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,347
by becoming strong yourself.

650
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,437
Understand?

651
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,520
In the future,

652
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:29,002
I also want to become a shop
owner just like you, Miss Mu Dan.

653
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,563
I want to make a lot of money

654
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:32,280
and help many people.

655
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,090
Good girl.

656
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:58,440
(Fang Garden)
