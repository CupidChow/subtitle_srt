3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
If you don't agree to the marriage,
you won't get the Zixi pill.

4
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,840
As long as mother can recover,
I am willing to do anything.

Bow before the mirror.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Husband and wife are one, perpetual bliss endures.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,040
Being forced to marry you
is the greatest humiliation of my life.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,240
Today, you need to go to Fuyun Temple to pray.

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,120
If you are not sincere,
the prayers will be ineffective.

10
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,800
Young Madam, remember to kneel for ten hours.
Do not rise until the hour of You arrives.

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,759
How bold! How dare you try to deceive me
in the Grand Celestial Master Hall.

Greetings, Floral Envoy.

13

Greetings to you all.

Do not try to get the tribute medicine again.

15
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:44,360
We must not let Madam He discover
that we gave her a counterfeit back then.

16
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,560
If I had discovered
that the Zixi pill was a counterfeit,

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,319
my mother wouldn't have passed away.

18
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,599
My lady, go to the shop. I am stopping them here.

19

Yu Lu, let's go home.

23
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,520
I never had my heart set on Liu Chang.

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,280
If you wish to do this,
you must act swiftly and decisively.

25
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:26,520
Please witness for me and approve my divorce.

26
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,719
Part ways and find happiness separately.

27
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,439
It is a beautiful story.

28
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,640
This matter is concluded. Court dismissed.

29
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,479
Your Highness, I have never been your enemy.
This is a win-win strategy.

30
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,639
I am just a woman who wishes
to hold her fate in her own hands.

31
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,840
But she is too greedy,

32
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,560
insisting on taking the dowry
and even stirring up a lawsuit

33
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,159
to ruin the reputation of the Liu family.

34
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,159
We cannot keep her alive.

35
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,360
Mu Dan's escape at night is indeed disgraceful.

36
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,639
I will definitely establish myself in Chang'an.

We weren't born on the same day,
but seek to get rich on the same day.

My house is not next
to the backyard of the Jiang Mansion,

you really don't seem like a corrupt official.

I hope this person can understand me
better than I understand myself.

If I married He Wei Fang,
ending Zi Shu's affection of her,

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,840
You have been so kind to us.
How can we repay your kindness?

175
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,200
What are you doing? Get up, get up.

176
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,479
We are all one family. Don't talk about repayment.

177
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,840
These are your indentures.

178
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,240
The past was bitter,
but the future will be better.

179
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,719
From now on, you are no longer servants,
but are free people.

180
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,320
Madam, we found the missing
white jade pearl hairpin in her room.

181
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,719
Now that we caught her red-handed,
how do you plan to deal with her?

182
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,840
I moved to live in Fragrance Garden long ago.
That house has been empty since then.

183
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,199
What hairpin? I have never seen it.

184
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,559
If you didn't steal it,
did Mu Dan steal it and hide it with you?

185
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,080
Nonsense.

186
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,120
Anyway, if you didn't do it, then she did it,
or maybe both of you conspired.

187
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,200
Go call Mr. Jiang. Let him see
what kind of person is sleeping beside him.

188
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Yes.

189
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,320
I was told to marry Mr. Jiang by His Highness.

190
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,840
Now that I caught you stealing,
I should deal with it for His Highness.

191
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,399
You framed me. Mr. Jiang wouldn't believe you.

192
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,639
You, a thief, how dare you to slander me!

193
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,080
Slap her mouth a hundred times as punishment.

194
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes.

195
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,000
I didn't do it. Let me go.

196
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,639
Let me go. Let go of me.

197
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,040
Don't touch me. Let me go.

198
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,480
I act with integrity. Come at me.

199
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,639
If you dare to frame Mu Dan rashly,
there won't be just me bleeding in this room.

200
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,959
Mr. Jiang, you must take a good look.

201
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,479
You…

202
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,759
Mr. Jiang, you're finally here.
Mu Dan's people stole my jewelry.

203
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,840
I was merely asking a few questions
and she even attacked me.

204
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,759
I am hurt and so scared.

205
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,200
I didn't. You are just making things up.

206
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,904
- Fu.
- It's you…

207
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:34,480
That's it. Mr. Jiang,
do you believe in Lian Zhou's word?

208
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,280
Lian Zhou…

209
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,720
Of course not.

210
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,879
It's my fault that you're caught
in such a situation, I am…

211
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,759
It's nothing, just a wound.

212
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,040
You sit down.

213
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:52,240
I'm fine, as long as you believe in Mu Dan.

214
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
If you don't believe me…

215
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,439
Sit down. Can you take care of yourself first?

216
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,480
Your body is inherited from your parents.

217
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,040
If your mother knew about this,
she would be heartbroken.

218
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,720
Right. I need to stay here until I'm better.

219
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,919
Be nicer.

220
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,559
Chuan Yu, you are good to Fu,
even more attentive than to your master.

221
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,440
I've hurt my back, but you didn't care at all.

222
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,640
Naturally, the one
who caused your back injury should care.

223
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,000
- Fu, Fu.
- Mu Dan.

224
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,720
Fu, let me see where you're hurt.

225
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Here.

226
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Has the physician been here? Will it leave a scar?

227
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,480
It's alright, I don't care about it at all.

228
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,119
Mr. Jiang has checked it, and gave me
the imperial medicine. Don't worry.

229
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,400
With such an injury, how can you still smile?

230
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,680
Just a little.

231
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,960
Dou Jin told you everything
before you arrived here, right?

232
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't worry, Chuan Yu has applied medicine for me.

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Go check on Mr. Jiang's back injury.

234
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,319
Your back got injured by Lian Zhou?

235
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,359
No, it has nothing to do with today.

236
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,800
Chuan Yu, please take good care of Fu for me.

237
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Honey, come with me.

238
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,159
I have something to tell you.

239
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,960
Well, Lian Zhou is here because of me.

240
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,079
I'm sorry for that. I'm willing
to cooperate with you in acting.

241
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,920
But this has nothing to do with Fu.

242
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,680
Now, Lian Zhou treats Fu this way,
slandering her and punishing her.

243
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,680
I must seek justice for Fu.

244
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
If you want to stop me…

245
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:17,359
Why would I? Tell me whatever you need me to do.

246
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,079
No need for that. Thank you.

247
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,240
You injured your back
when you carried me back that night?

248
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,359
You remember that night?

249
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,159
I was drunk, not dead. Of course, I remember.

250
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,159
I just drank a bit too much,
and only remember a little.

251
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,839
A little is enough. Then you'll pay
the cost of treating the back injury.

252
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,279
Did they have a quarrel?

253
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,039
The door was closed, and no sound came out,

254
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,160
but I saw He Wei Fang return
to her courtyard with a stern face.

255
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,359
Once she left,

256
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,160
Mr. Jiang sent someone to inform us
that he will rest in your room tonight.

257
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,359
I knew it. Men are never single-minded.

258
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,440
It seems the Jiang Mansion
will be exclusively for you.

259
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,400
Add more petals to the water,
then light all the incense in the room.

260
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Yes.

261
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,680
Quack physician, can't even cure a few rashes.

262
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,000
Madam, these rashes have developed strangely.

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,680
I heard that He Wei Fang understands
some pharmacology. Maybe she's behind this.

264
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,879
Madam, when Mr. Jiang comes,
you must ask him to stand up for you.

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,359
What time is it?

266
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,319
It's the hour of Xu.

267
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:08,319
If Mr. Jiang sees me like this now,
how can I win his favor?

268
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,440
Go tell Mr. Jiang that I was very happy
to know that he comes,

269
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,519
but I caught a chill while bathing,

270
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,440
and I'm afraid of infecting him,
so please do not visit.

271
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Once I recover, I will go apologize to him.

272
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,240
Yes.

273
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,319
Madam, do you really want to do this?

274
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,079
I have consulted several physicians,
and they all said they can't cure it.

275
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,759
What else can I do but plead with her?

276
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,599
What a humiliation.

277
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,960
Haven't I endured enough humiliation already?

278
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,119
What's the harm in enduring it one more?

279
00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:01,119
As long as I can recover my face, there will be
plenty of opportunities to deal with her.

280
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,559
Mu Dan, could you please meet me?

281
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,519
Mu Dan.

282
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,440
Lian Zhou, what's the matter?

283
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,599
After I bathed with flowers last night,
and I covered in itchy rashes somehow.

284
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:33,160
I know you understand pharmacology,
could you please help me out?

285
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,519
Unfortunately,

286
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,920
I heard that Fu stole your jewelry,
and it's currently under investigation.

287
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,400
Before there are any leads,
I have no time to deal with it.

288
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,200
I-I've made a mistake. Lady Zhu Fu did not steal.

289
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,519
In that case, then you falsely accused Fu.

290
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:01,519
How would you compensate for the injury
on Fu's neck and the wrongs suffered?

291
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,240
I will explain to the servants
and restore Lady Zhu Fu's innocence.

292
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,880
That's what you should do.
How is that compensation?

293
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,040
Slander deserves a hundred slaps.
This is what you said, right?

294
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,800
Then please count them, Mu Dan, Zhu Fu.

295
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,280
What trick did you use to make her come
and admit her mistake?

296
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,440
Chun previously extracted
a lot of flower juice for making beauty pills.

297
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,880
She discovered that mixing several types
of flower juices can cause the rashes.

298
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,279
Though there's no danger to life,
it can damage one's appearance

299
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,880
and cause unbearable itch.

300
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,319
So I took some and put it in her bathtub.

301
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,799
You framed her for theft,
and now you deserve what you did.

302
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,480
You need to write a statement of apology
and put it in the hall to apologize to Zhu Fu.

303
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,480
Okay, I'll write it later.
Mu Dan, can you give me the antidote recipe?

304
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,319
I don't know your past,

305
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,400
but I can tell that you didn't want
to marry into here.

306
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,279
You must have your grievances and helplessness,

307
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,759
so try to secure something
at the Jiang Mansion to rely on for a lifetime.

308
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,680
It's reasonable, and I can understand it.

309
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,200
I'm focused solely on business
and don't want to fight for anything with you.

310
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
If you no longer harm
my close friends and relatives,

311
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,000
we can still live in peace as we did before.

312
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,159
Focused solely on business?
Don't you care about Mr. Jiang's affections?

313
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,280
I mean Sui Zhi and I are mutually in love,
so I don't need to fight for anything.

314
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:22,160
Instead of wasting time here,
you should treat yourself better.

315
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,960
You!

316
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,839
Don't get upset over a man
who doesn't care about you.

317
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,480
The more you get mad,
the harder the rashes to subside.

318
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,040
Temper justice with mercy.
You are truly something.

319
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:50,200
The world is harsh for us women,
why employ tricks to harm each other?

320
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,870
You are the adopted daughter of Prince Ning.

321
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,839
Besides your beauty, you must
have other remarkable qualities.

322
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,328
Is there nothing else you want to do
besides pleasing your husband?

323
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:15,880
I have many exceptionally talented women here.
They have long escaped the inner chambers.

324
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,119
Now, they are all enjoying their lives
in embroidery, gardening, making incense,

325
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,240
and dressing up.

326
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,720
If you're interested in gardening,
you can come visit my garden.

327
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,480
You want me to grow flowers
and do business with you?

328
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,680
Anything wrong with that?

329
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,279
You are so strange, married to Floral Envoy,

330
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,240
yet still working hard
to earn small amounts of money.

331
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,960
I truly don't understand
why Mr. Jiang is so devoted to you.

332
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,759
What's wrong with earning money?
Who would refuse money?

333
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,160
Besides, he likes me for having such abilities.

334
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,040
Don't be arrogant.

335
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,960
Apply it three times a day,
and you'll be cured in seven days.

336
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,599
Think about what I've told you today.

337
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,359
If you figure it out, you can come to me anytime.

338
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,160
I truly don't understand

339
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,760
why Mr. Jiang is so devoted to you.

340
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,960
We acted our play so well
that Lian Zhou would say that.

341
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,520
Dusk.

342
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,272
[Joyful]

343
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Oh no.

344
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Mr. Jiang, I toast to you.

345
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,880
They all say the newly appointed
Deputy Transport Officer is strict and fair.

346
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,759
Mr. Qi, you should drink less.

347
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,800
If you come to work with the smell of alcohol
tomorrow, I'm afraid you'll get scolded.

348
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,599
I didn't have much work before.

349
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,039
Since Liu Chang came, he's being strict and fair,

350
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,599
showing no mercy at all.

351
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,640
We're so busy that we couldn't even take a break.

352
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,519
Liu Chang is just Prince Ning's son-in-law,

353
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,859
and a pedantic scholar from a humble background.

354
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,039
What can he achieve?

355
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,119
He really has high ambitions.

356
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,559
Repairing docks and consolidating fleets.

357
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:10,480
I think he won't stop
until he shows Prince Ning some achievement.

358
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,519
Zi Shu is working so hard,
is he aiming for promotion or…?

359
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,319
Who doesn't want a promotion?
But benefits must still be secured.

360
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:27,160
Otherwise, Liu Chang's meager salary
cannot support noble Lady Li.

361
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,119
Despite complaining,
you still diligently follow Zi Shu's lead.

362
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:37,000
Mr. Qi, the jade pendant you're wearing today
is probably worth as much as a year's salary.

363
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,309
It's better to share the joy than enjoy alone.

364
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,839
With such a lucrative opportunity,

365
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,799
Mr. Qi, why don't you come
to my mansion tomorrow and tell me?

366
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,680
My pleasure.

367
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:01,399
I think the jade at Mr. Jiang's waist
looks even better.

368
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:08,440
A precious jade matches a beauty well.

369
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,160
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

370
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,759
Wait, Mr. Jiang.
You promised to give me a bracelet.

371
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,159
You must not be biased.

372
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:37,319
It's late, just drinking isn't fun.
How about blowing out a few candles?

373
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:44,200
What's the hurry on such a long night?
We haven't even finished enjoying the wine.

374
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,760
Even if it's just a social,
he doesn't have to hold women like this.

375
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,879
Lian Zhou believed it,
surely hasn't seen Jiang Chang Yang this way.

376
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,480
I knew it. I almost got confused by Lian Zhou.

377
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,079
Jiang Sui Zhi, it's this late at night.
Why don't you go home?

378
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,240
If you want to drink, I can accompany you.

379
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,440
You're busy with business, yet you
surprisingly had time to pick me up today.

380
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,639
Then, of course, I should drink with you.

381
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,119
Mr. Qi, pay attention
to the business we discussed.

382
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,680
My beloved is picking me up, so I'm leaving.

383
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,839
Sui Zhi, you…

384
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:51,920
Recently, Huamanzhu
released new sachets. Have a try.

385
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,960
The rouge scent from Huanyun Tower
is indeed too strong.

386
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,400
If you have these sachets,

387
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:03,000
when returning home, you can avoid
interrogation from wives and concubines, right?

388
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Farewell.

389
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,440
What's going on?

390
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,880
We agreed you'd come to rescue me
at the first quarter of the Xu hour,

391
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,279
but you arrived at the third.

392
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,240
If you were any later, the candles
in the room would have blown out.

393
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,509
I got frightened by Lian Zhou.

394
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,240
We acted too well,

395
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,000
and Lian Zhou truly thinks you fall for me.

396
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,519
She even told me a bunch of strange words.

397
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,440
She should really see
your flirtatious behavior today.

398
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,639
Just take what she said a joke.
You didn't take it seriously, did you?

399
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,920
Of course, I didn't.

400
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,519
Lian Zhou only sees how good you treat me,

401
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,240
yet doesn't know that it is because
we have a life-and-death friendship.

402
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,759
But it's understandable
that outsiders don't understand

403
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,399
why a high-ranking official
treats a small merchant so well.

404
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,380
Over the years, I've seen a lot
of intrigues in officialdom

405
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,800
and the false pretenses between people.

406
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,880
Someone as honest and open-minded
as you is really rare.

407
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,280
Of course, I would treat you sincerely.

408
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,119
Are you drunk? Why are you suddenly praising me?

409
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,520
Making me feel quite embarrassed.

410
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,759
You are this kind of person,
so you can receive others' kindness towards you.

411
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,319
Moreover, you also treat me well.

412
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,799
You said it's hard to find a soulmate.

413
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,720
There's no need to always express gratitude,
it makes us seem distant.

414
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,079
You treat me sincerely,
and I will never let you down as a soulmate.

415
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,519
From now on, in my heart, besides Fu and Chun,

416
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,760
you are my most important person.

417
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,839
If you need help, just tell me.

418
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,760
Jiang Xiao Hua, we are soulmates,
and I can only rank third in your heart?

419
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,959
Naturally, besties are more important.

420
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:58,519
Here, take the prescription to get the medicine.

421
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,319
Okay, thanks.

422
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,960
Have all the gifts from clients been returned?

423
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,280
Ms. Luo, who came for a consultation last time,
embroidered this handkerchief to show gratitude.

424
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,280
This isn't any precious item,
and with shopkeeper's name,

425
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,359
so I decided to keep it.

426
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,920
[High Medical Skills]

427
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,360
Her eye condition just improved,
she shouldn't do such taxing things.

428
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,439
When she comes,
I'll definitely give her a good talking to.

429
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,239
Please call the next person.

430
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,039
Yes.

431
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,839
Father.

432
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,039
Liu Lang, remember.

433
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,319
Spring is not yet full,
and crops are already growing. That's Qin.

434
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,359
I taught your sister like this too.

435
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,119
Right, Liu Lang.
You're holding the brush wrong again.

436
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,480
Hold the brush like this,

437
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,719
only then will the strokes
in your writing be proper.

438
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,519
See? Here, try again.

439
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes, combine these two.

440
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,519
Move this back. Okay, try it now.

441
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,360
It's this feeling. Nice. Right.

442
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,160
Go further down.

443
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Mu Dan.

444
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,760
Why are you here at this hour? Continue.

445
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
You've helped Consort Shu recuperate
for several months, and she has improved a lot.

446
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,280
Before returning to the palace,
she asked me to give you this painting

447
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,399
to thank you for your companionship
during this time.

448
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:10,479
She paid me for those medicinal herbs
and supplies. Why is Consort Shu so polite?

449
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,920
You often ride with Consort Shu.
Your polo skills must have improved a lot.

450
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,719
That's natural, do you dare
to compete with me someday?

451
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,360
How bold, do you dare to bet on it?

452
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,280
Isn't the interest you've collected
from me enough? Want to swindle me for more?

453
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,559
Don't even think about it.

454
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,480
Consort Shu has given you her well-bred horse.

455
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,640
With a fine horse, are you still afraid to lose?

456
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,119
Consort Shu has never looked down on me
because of my rank.

457
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,039
She treats me well.

458
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,320
Now that she has returned, it's not
as comfortable as being in another palace.

459
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,960
Could you persuade His Majesty
to visit her more often?

460
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,559
At least let her see her child more often.

461
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,079
Don't worry, Consort Shu has been away
from the palace for a long time.

462
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,640
His Majesty also misses her greatly
and will surely treat her well.

463
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,760
Mu Dan, I've written another character,
please check if it's correct.

464
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,480
I've never taught you this character,
how did you learn it?

465
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,239
I've been observing the plaque
of the Fragrant Garden,

466
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,599
so I learn to write it.

467
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,760
Liu Lang is smart.
I'll teach you another character then.

468
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,560
The Garden in Fragrance Garden.

469
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,240
Here.

470
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,919
I'll write the outer part.

471
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,439
Give it a try.

472
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,760
Liu Lang is clever, but

473
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,880
Mu Dan is busy with business
and can't teach you calligraphy every day.

474
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,960
How about I find you a private tutor?

475
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,840
I don't want any tutor,
having Mu Dan teach me is enough.

476
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,319
I only like to cook, and I am not cut out
for studying and being an official.

477
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,960
Liu Lang, becoming an official
is not the only path to succeed.

478
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,039
If you like cooking,
I can hire a restaurant chef for you.

479
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,840
Learn from him for a few years,
then you can open your own restaurant.

480
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,880
I…

481
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,679
I heard that Chef Xue from Fuguilou
plans to take on an apprentice this year.

482
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:35,880
Really? That would be great.

483
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,679
Do you know him? Could you introduce him?

484
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,480
I can take Liu Lang to visit him.

485
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,280
No problem.

486
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,639
Mu Dan, I've heard that Floral Envoy
enjoys painting for the beauties of Huanyun Tower.

487
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,080
Can you have Floral Envoy make a painting for us?

488
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,240
Asking me to paint. Shouldn't you come ask me?

489
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:06,360
I am not worthy of speaking to you,

490
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,319
so I can only ask Mu Dan.

491
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,320
Liu Lang, you have to respect yourself.

492
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,479
No matter what you want,
you must not belittle yourself, understand?

493
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,160
Understood.

494
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,480
Today I am available and in a good mood,

495
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,080
so I will paint a picture.

496
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,800
This painting is titled "Liu Lang Admiring
the Love of Mu Dan and Chang Yang".

497
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,519
Where is Liu Lang?

498
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:44,840
This is a painting technique.

499
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,120
He's not in the painting, but actually
seeing the people in the painting.

500
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,079
This painting is nice hanging here.

501
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,280
All guests will know our deep affection then.

502
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,800
Mu Dan, something happened to Chun.

503
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:27,264
♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

504
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:35,678
♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

505
00:41:35,678 --> 00:41:43,870
♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

506
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:52,222
♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

507
00:41:52,222 --> 00:42:00,419
♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

508
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:08,606
♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

509
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:17,022
♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

510
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:25,022
♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

511
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:53,174
♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

512
00:42:53,174 --> 00:43:00,625
♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

513
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:08,611
♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

514
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:16,920
♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

515
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:25,182
♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

516
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:33,438
♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

517
00:43:33,438 --> 00:43:41,866
♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

518
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:49,866
♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
