1
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:37,949
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,920
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,360
Leader Lv, come.

4
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:49,309
Leader Lv.

5
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,800
Come here.

6
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
About the plan we discussed
last time, it still needs work.

7
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,157
What do you think they are talking about?

8
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:02,400
Da Fu.

9
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,440
Why are you saying behind my back?

10
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,780
- We... - At the back.

11
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,680
Look. At the back.

12
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,556
Leader Lv, are you interested
in Li Xing as your son-in-law?

13
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,504
Yes.

14
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,479
No way.

15
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,839
Xiao Chun has been
focused on treating patients.

16
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,996
I've never seen her get
interested in falling in love.

17
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,920
Madam, you used to be the same as well.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,715
It's all thanks to Young
Master spending money and...

19
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:42,161
Well...

20
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,396
Mu Dan. We prepared
a surprise for Xiao Chun.

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,320
When the time comes, we need
you to trick her into going there.

22
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,664
All right.

23
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,318
Don't tell other people.

24
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,875
Well, everyone heard it.

25
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,516
Just don't tell anyone.

26
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,595
Accepted by all.

27
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,076
Accepting Heaven's mandate.

28
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,076
Accepting Heaven's mandate.

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,116
I've harmed you to this extent.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,195
Why are you still hesitating?

31
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,900
This is the final moment in your life.

32
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,466
Do you feel regret?

33
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,796
I have

34
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,195
been living in regret all my life.

35
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,676
That is why I've become who I am today.

36
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,116
I don't want to live the
way I lived in the past.

37
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,596
Whether you are dead or alive,

38
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,676
you'll still be free.

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,079
What about me?

40
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,435
If you hate me, just kill me.

41
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,515
Why must you betray my father?

42
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,640
Since you betrayed him,

43
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
why did you plead with His Majesty

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,036
to spare me?

45
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,839
You are not the one I hate.

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,716
We are the same.

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,676
I hate your father.

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,916
He broke my leg.

49
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,676
He broke my vigor.

50
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,356
He also

51
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,732
cut off my path to being a loyal official.

52
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,315
Having a father like that,

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,156
I won't be happy no matter who I marry.

54
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,116
Even if he's unforgivable,

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,955
he is still my father.

56
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,835
I can't bring myself to hate him.

57
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,996
I'm unfit to be his daughter.

58
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,195
I can't kill my enemy.

59
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,875
I also can't bring myself

60
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
not to love you.

61
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,892
Liu Chang.

62
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,835
Your life

63
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,835
has been ruined by me.

64
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,156
My life

65
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,116
is also destroyed in your hands.

66
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,332
- We are even from now on. - You Zhen!

67
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:16,658
You Zhen!

68
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,075
We are even

69
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,156
about everything in the past.

70
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,356
From today onward,

71
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,036
I, Liu Chang, a commoner,

72
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,356
am willing to live

73
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,476
a frugal and peaceful life

74
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,315
with my wife, You Zhen.

75
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:36,519
(Peerless Youthful Beauty)

76
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,239
(Wuyong Clinic)

77
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Those who need a consultation, come inside.

78
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,395
Yes. Come inside, everyone.

79
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,733
- Come inside. - Slowly.

80
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:55,890
Are they pretty?

81
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,296
It's the same
color as your outfit.

82
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,199
- I like this. - All right, I'll take both.

83
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,797
Sure.

84
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,399
Don't you want to
buy one for yourselves?

85
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:03,182
- Thank you, Zhu Fu. - Owner, here you go.

86
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,962
I don't have a high salary so I
won't be buying children's toys.

87
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:07,683
Try it.

88
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,637
I want that one.

89
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,812
Give it to me. Here you go.

90
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,116
I know Da Fu is the best.

91
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,336
- Young Master. - I saw this.

92
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,877
Let's go.

93
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,476
Is that so? This
one has a big nose.

94
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,476
One, two, three.

95
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,299
Again.

96
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:31,116
You cheated!

97
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,755
Let's go. Let's take a look in front.

98
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,360
Why do you look so foolish?

99
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,880
Why is Da Fu so cute?

100
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,120
How do I know?

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,520
Young Master. Madam. Take care.

102
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
- Thank you. - Come again.

103
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,873
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

104
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:51,135
You're still buying after
shopping for so long?

105
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,515
When can we have a cup
of wine at Linjiang Tavern?

106
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:55,147
There's no rush.

107
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,880
Although we need to drink
wine on a boat during the festival,

108
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,728
but we should understand
our wives' difficulties.

109
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,956
When they've had their
fun, they will rest somewhere.

110
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:05,847
Young Master Li, you are so considerate.

111
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,681
I'm sure you'll win over
a beautiful lady's heart.

112
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:08,756
Thank you.

113
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,294
Vice Minister, it's your day off today.

114
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,034
Instead of gathering with your students,

115
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,196
you came out with couples like us.

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,000
- Don't we annoy you? - This is nice.

117
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
Chuan Yu, let me help you with it.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,638
Thank you.

119
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,600
Li Xing wants
to pick a nice jade

120
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,836
for the person he likes.

121
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,280
He purposely asked me and Da Fu

122
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,502
to be his strategists.

123
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,643
Pick a jade?

124
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,641
You can find me if you want to pick a jade!

125
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:28,757
Not so loud.

126
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,196
Li Xing is not a greedy official.

127
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,520
Do you think he can afford
the jade piece you chose?

128
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,203
Try it.

129
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,555
It's not bad. Try this.

130
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:43,356
The capital is surrounded
by its neighboring cities.

131
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,275
You will soon go far away.

132
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,599
Though we part,

133
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,279
we are both officials who are traveling.

134
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,116
Having true friends in this realm,

135
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,400
we feel like neighbors
even though we are far apart.

136
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,436
There is no use crying and
wetting our sleeves when we part.

137
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,464
- Good! - What a good poem.

138
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,555
Do another one.

139
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,763
When I make enough money from
selling calligraphy and paintings,

140
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,755
We'll live in seclusion at
Mount Zigai outside the city.

141
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,076
We will build a wooden house

142
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,174
and plant a garden full
of vegetables and fruits.

143
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,800
I won't have a care for
matters in Chang'an anymore.

144
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,316
A peaceful life

145
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,116
until we grow old.

146
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:30,315
Zi Shu.

147
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:32,451
Perhaps

148
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,915
we can really start over again.

149
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,875
The villain is dead!

150
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,155
No one can harm me now!

151
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,915
I will become a scholar
in the Spring Examination!

152
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,356
I will become a scholar
in the Spring Examination!

153
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,761
- There's a murder! - Someone is killed!

154
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:25,795
You Zhen.

155
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,507
You Zhen.

156
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:31,212
Don't cry.

157
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,499
Don't cry.

158
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,577
Sorry.

159
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:29,546
Alms Giver.

160
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
This is a place of
tranquility for Buddhists.

161
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,159
You mustn't commit suicide here.

162
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,915
I've committed many sins.

163
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,275
I'm unworthy of staying alive.

164
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,956
Abbess, your mercy

165
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,515
should not be given to people like me.

166
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,716
A person who bears karma

167
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,840
have no right to escape by seeking death

168
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,491
before atoning.

169
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,428
Come.

170
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,876
No one is going to confess to me.

171
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,555
Everything is prepared by Lord Jiang.

172
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:12,893
Your birthday is in spring

173
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,975
and the day in spring is short.

174
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,355
There were many upsetting incidents too.

175
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,640
After so long,

176
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,795
I can finally celebrate your birthday.

177
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,075
Now that I think about it,

178
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,956
it was also spring

179
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,716
when we first met.

180
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,636
Jiang Chang Yang.

181
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,315
You are just

182
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,080
plucking all the expensive peonies.

183
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,573
Are you so rich that you have
no place to spend your money?

184
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,115
These are not real.

185
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,515
They are made by Leader Lv.

186
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,636
They are rice-paper plant flowers

187
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,070
made to look like your favorite peonies.

188
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,196
All right. All of you can come out now.

189
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,117
Even if Jiang Chang Yang was capable,

190
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,873
he couldn't plan all of these so
meticulously in the last few days.

191
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,958
Come out now.

192
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,039
- Let's go. - Let's go.

193
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,515
All of you are good.

194
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,476
Li Xing, you too.

195
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,436
You can even lie with a straight face now.

196
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,996
They are not all lies.

197
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,355
Who did you

198
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
give the jade piece to?

199
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,120
Not bad, Li Xing.

200
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,720
You've won the heart of a pretty lady.

201
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,636
I couldn't find the right
opportunity to tell everyone.

202
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:28,561
Come with me. Let's see

203
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,408
how the longevity
noodles are coming along.

204
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,020
All right.

205
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,322
Serve them slowly.

206
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,476
I still have some things to do.

207
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,396
Come here, Miss Yun. Stand in the middle.

208
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,716
Thanks to your plan,

209
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,876
I can use your plan for my own purpose.

210
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,612
- Da Fu. - It's me!

211
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,279
Come back! I'll beat you to death!

212
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,812
- Stop! I... - Give it to me.

213
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,612
- Xiao Chun! - It's me.

214
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:10,848
What about that young lady?

215
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,815
She's good at fighting.

216
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,395
We'll wait for
her at the shop.

217
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,052
My medicine!

218
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,275
Hurry! Forget the medicine, let's go!

219
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,195
Who else?

220
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,332
- This is me. - Liu Lang.

221
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,436
Man. Tao. Look at us.

222
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:47,939
Us?

223
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,230
Chuan Yu. It's both of us.

224
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,996
Chuan Yu is shy.

225
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:01,659
Everyone,

226
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,115
you've been

227
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,002
going through the difficult days with me

228
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,996
and you've turned them into good days.

229
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,342
I thank all of you

230
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:12,926
for putting in so much effort to
celebrate my birthday with me.

231
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,755
I, He Wei Fang, am very fortunate

232
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,200
to meet all of you in my life.

233
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:29,835
I'll make it short.

234
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,581
Anyway,

235
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,040
I'm grateful to all of you
for accompanying me.

236
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:38,906
Thank you.

237
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,422
That's not right.

238
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,396
Isn't this a surprise for Mu Dan?

239
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
Who leaked the secret?

240
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,352
All of you are crying like this.

241
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,595
I'm sure it's because of
Mu Dan's bad drawing.

242
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,920
She spent a few nights drawing them.

243
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,343
Her hands are almost broken.

244
00:24:58,087 --> 00:24:59,113
Young Master.

245
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,080
You suggested this plan

246
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,196
so why are you revealing your own surprise?

247
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,035
What did Mu Dan do

248
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,476
to make you reveal everything?

249
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,303
Talk.

250
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,439
What are all of you hiding from me?

251
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,813
No. I have nothing to hide.

252
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:21,451
Jiang Sui Zhi,

253
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,555
do you think I don't understand Li Xing,

254
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,876
Xiao Chun,

255
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:27,498
or you well enough?

256
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,355
It's a long story.

257
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,755
It's a really long story.

258
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,160
Come and eat some noodles.

259
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,342
Come here. Stop crying.

260
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,555
Today is a good day.

261
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,840
Come quickly. Eat the noodles.

262
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,399
Here. This bowl is for you.

263
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,636
Eat more. They smell so nice.

264
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,224
Mu Dan, what do you
think about my new wine?

265
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,504
Do you think it can become
Zuijin Pavilion's signature?

266
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,663
It's only decent.

267
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,275
I was joking.

268
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,810
With Miss Jin's wine and Liu Lang's dishes,

269
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,699
Business at Zuijin
Pavilion will be good.

270
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:07,495
Save some for me.

271
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,396
Mu Dan, I've grown up.

272
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,812
I can open my own shop
now so you can rest assured.

273
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,279
The overall situation now is good.

274
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,396
My ungrateful son has returned as well.

275
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,759
He has been helping us out

276
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,079
with many chores in the garden.

277
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,196
Madam He, just go.

278
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,755
With me around,

279
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,508
I won't let any flower
in this garden wilt.

280
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,413
Good.

281
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,075
Sheng County's workshop is growing.

282
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:31,322
It is going to hire women
from neighboring counties.

283
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,560
Magistrate Yu is very ambitious

284
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,959
He said he'd show you

285
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,976
the newly-built granary
when you return next time.

286
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,479
Just let him do his thing.

287
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,916
I need to take a good look then.

288
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,976
I found a lady who is as good at
playing a musical instrument as I.

289
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,595
She is willing to work in Fang Garden.

290
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,035
Just use her as you wish.

291
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,196
Sure, Tao. Follow me and
explore the lands with me together.

292
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,196
Wasn't it fine just now?

293
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,755
What's wrong with everyone?

294
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,196
Everyone told you not to worry

295
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,599
but all of them were
reluctant to see you go.

296
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:09,464
Indeed.

297
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,247
All of us have finally gathered
but why must you leave again?

298
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,956
Madam Sun, there are times
when flowers bloom and wilt.

299
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,519
People gather and separate as well.

300
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,755
Don't worry. Da Fu told me

301
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,835
she won't be leaving with me this time.

302
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,115
She wants to stay here and serve you.

303
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,733
- Congratulations. - Yes.

304
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,595
Mother, I'm not leaving.

305
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,035
When Mu Dan and I weren't around,

306
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,275
I knew how worried you were.

307
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,555
Xiao Chun told me

308
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,835
your body isn't as healthy as it was.

309
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,439
You mustn't do any

310
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,716
hard and tiring work.

311
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,436
Moreover, you have me and Chuan...

312
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,315
Chuan Yu.

313
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,575
With both of us around,
just let us do all the work

314
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,759
in the house and the shop.

315
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,704
You can just enjoy your life.

316
00:27:55,784 --> 00:27:56,875
All right.

317
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,160
When you and Chuan Yu
give birth to a child for me,

318
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
I'll recover from any illnesses.

319
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,812
Mother! Chuan Yu...

320
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,115
Mu Dan, I should leave with you.

321
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,436
I dare not take you away.

322
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,751
Young Master,

323
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,716
without me by your side,

324
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,956
you must be careful when you fight.

325
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,595
Brat, I'm better at fighting than you.

326
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,196
When you came to me as an orphan,

327
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,566
you've been living a dangerous life.

328
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Now that you finally
have a home of your own,

329
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,196
You must live a good life.

330
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,747
Chang Yang is traveling
around as His Majesty's emissary.

331
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,835
I'm willing to stay in the
capital to be your emissary.

332
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:40,719
You have your duties to fulfill

333
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,679
but you mustn't neglect
your personal business.

334
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,275
You might be my subordinate

335
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:46,921
but you are also Zhen Qing Yun.

336
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,974
Wuyong Clinic which reopens
in Chang'an still needs me.

337
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,515
My father is old now.

338
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,916
I want to accompany him more.

339
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,878
I can only do business
in the south without worry

340
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,876
with you in the capital and Sheng County.

341
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,996
Xiao Chun, I'll leave
Wuyong Clinic in your care.

342
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:08,979
Sui Zhi,

343
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:11,227
you may leave without worries.

344
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,591
I will do my best as
an official in the capital

345
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:15,151
and fulfill our teacher's dying wish.

346
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,039
I won't let the peace you obtained
with your blood go to waste.

347
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:20,256
Mu Dan,

348
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:23,844
you showed me another way
to show loyalty to the empire.

349
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,920
Mother used to look down on merchants.

350
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,275
Now that she knows how capable you are,

351
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,035
she feels very embarrassed.

352
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,656
Here's a toast to what you did in the past

353
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,075
and your journey in the future.

354
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,376
Have a safe journey.

355
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,332
Thank you, Li Xing.

356
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,526
All right.

357
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,835
We are just doing business in the south.

358
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,800
Why are you making it
seem like we are dying?

359
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,800
Fang Garden is in Chang'an.

360
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,636
My family is also in Chang'an.

361
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,360
In the future, Sui Zhi and I

362
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,400
will come back to visit everyone at times.

363
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,355
Don't worry. I will take
good care of Mu Dan.

364
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,196
If she even loses some weight next time,

365
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,800
I'll accept your punishments.

366
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,400
They say a good time, scenery,

367
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,436
and things won't happen together.

368
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,595
Right now, the person I love and my friends

369
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,996
are all by my side.

370
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,645
Why not cherish the
moment and drink to this?

371
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,320
Come. Let's drink.

372
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,493
Come on, let's drink.

373
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,360
Liu Lang. I'm looking at you.
You didn't finish your drink.

374
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
I'll finish it. Get me another cup.

375
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,835
The night breeze here
is the most comfortable.

376
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:51,668
We'll depart tomorrow.

377
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,345
You entered the palace to
bid farewell to Consort Shu.

378
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,240
Have our new identities been given out?

379
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,466
(Resident, Jiang Da Shan)

380
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,566
Jiang Da Shan, are you satisfied?

381
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,555
You have Consort Shu to back you.

382
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,315
I don't think I can depend
on San Lang anymore.

383
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,092
Whatever. This is
karma for me. I'll admit it.

384
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,795
What is this?

385
00:31:45,842 --> 00:31:48,656
(Yang Residence's Title Deed)

386
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,400
Everything in the past

387
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,320
happened in this house.

388
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,555
I am reluctant to get rid of it.

389
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,600
Previously, you were lied to by an agent

390
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,120
and rented this small house.

391
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:02,758
Right now,

392
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,720
San Lang changed the
Jiang Residence's layout

393
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,040
and removed this place
from the Jiang Residence.

394
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,595
In the future, this will be our house.

395
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,275
I was very touched on my birthday.

396
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,595
I didn't expect you to have another plan.

397
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,315
The rotating lantern might be my idea

398
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,035
but everyone helped out

399
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,676
and you noticed my plan.

400
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,876
I had to think of something else

401
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,396
for your birthday gift.

402
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,676
I believe an evil merchant like
you won't reject a deed to a house.

403
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,532
Thank you, Jiang Chang Yang.

404
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,075
I gave you a precious gift

405
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,115
and you only kissed me once?

406
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,199
I don't know what I can give you

407
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,396
on your birthday.

408
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,481
I don't know where we would be

409
00:32:55,561 --> 00:32:57,515
and whether I have anyone to help me.

410
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,095
A greedy official is harder to
deal with than an evil merchant.

411
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:03,236
You must think of it carefully, Dear.

412
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,676
Open the garden!

413
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,035
The peonies have bloomed today!

414
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,515
Welcome, everyone!

415
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,015
Now that both of you have
joined the Flower Association,

416
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,956
In the future, you'll share
your fate with the association.

417
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,560
If you face any difficulties,

418
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,183
please let us know.

419
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,555
The Flower Association of Chang'an
treats men and women the same

420
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,555
so we can have the opportunity
to open our own shop.

421
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,679
- Thank you, Leader. - Thank you, Leader.

422
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,715
I'm not the one who made the new rule.

423
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,876
It was made by Madam He, the
Chief Flower Merchant of the State,

424
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,436
appointed by His Majesty.

425
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,476
I've heard about Madam He.

426
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,396
However, she was harmed by her husband

427
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,956
and her whereabouts and fate are unknown.

428
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,115
A kind person like Madam He

429
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,880
will surely get through her troubles.

430
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:27,059
Yes.

431
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,515
There's no need to worry about her.

432
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,877
Thank you.

433
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,555
Madam He is selling
flowers and medicine

434
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,876
and helping the people around the land.

435
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,527
Thank you, Madam He.

436
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:40,459
You've worked hard.

437
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,072
You've worked hard.

438
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,316
Thank you, Madam He.

439
00:34:47,012 --> 00:34:48,113
Madam Lian.

440
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:53,764
This is for you.

441
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,221
(Divorce Letter)

442
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,853
From now on, you are free.

443
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,916
There's no need to worry

444
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:09,121
about suffering with that
gambling addict anymore.

445
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,316
Thank you, Madam He!

446
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,933
What are you doing? Stand up!

447
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,796
Thank you, Madam He.

448
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,429
Look. This is my inn.

449
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,719
Further in front, there's a flower shop,

450
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,199
an apothecary and a pharmacy.

451
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,555
Madam Lian, you grew
up in a fishing village.

452
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,132
- Can you swim? - Yes.

453
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,085
Are you used to riding on boats?

454
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,215
I am.

455
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,959
I have a fleet of merchant ships.

456
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,796
You can make a living there.

457
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,876
Thank you, Madam He.

458
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,876
There are many ways to
make money in this world.

459
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,916
I believe all of you will
definitely make a living

460
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,276
live a better life.

461
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,753
All right.

462
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,635
Madam He, you are so capable.

463
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:07,519
Won't your husband be
worse when compared to you?

464
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,738
Does he treat you well?

465
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,595
We don't compete against
each other when we are married.

466
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,235
My husband treats me well.

467
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,933
You will see him later.

468
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,356
Just in front. We'll arrive
at the flower shop soon.

469
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,967
You can grind the pearl powder finer.

470
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:28,740
Young Master, how's this?

471
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,443
Very good.

472
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,356
- What about me? - Not bad.

473
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,880
Madam He, is this your husband?

474
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,316
Look at this. It suits
your skin color a lot.

475
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,688
Jiang Da Shan.

476
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,813
- Dear... - Come with me.

477
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,095
I'm just helping you sell fragrance powder.

478
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,555
Don't misunderstand.

479
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,559
I don't lack an employee

480
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,035
who sells fragrance powder for me.

481
00:36:56,752 --> 00:36:58,039
Dear. Of course,

482
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,439
you need a handsome employee
with a silver tongue like me.

483
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,800
Have a look and buy more.

484
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,195
Pick more and buy more!

485
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,635
Your acting is getting better.

486
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,756
The wives of those officials

487
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,959
will never know that I'm the Touring
Inspecting Censor in plain clothes.

488
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,155
I saw how happy you were out there.

489
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,396
I was only acting.

490
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:32,675
I'm only happy when I'm with you.

491
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,333
Go away. Come here.

492
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:41,822
Let me tell you something important.

493
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:44,495
After doing business in
Yangzhou for a few months,

494
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,519
I paid close attention

495
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,595
to the tax here.

496
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,996
It is not very different from
the emperor's new policy.

497
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,195
What about you? Did you
find any useful information?

498
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,715
Governor Ge

499
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,336
went on a trip with his wife
on the 15th day of last month.

500
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
He left for half a month.

501
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,081
On the tenth day of this month,

502
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,839
he is going hunting with his wife again.

503
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,235
Now is the time to irrigate the river.

504
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,210
It is when farmers are busy planting crops.

505
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,045
Why is a governor neglecting his duties

506
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,996
and going on trips?

507
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:15,383
His Majesty is putting
in effort in governing.

508
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,199
There might be fewer corrupt officials

509
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:20,108
but there are still many useless
officials who don't do their duties.

510
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,281
They mustn't be spared.

511
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:25,361
Now that you've made a
decision from your investigation,

512
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,666
you should reveal your
identity when you think it's time.

513
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,655
All right. I need to go out
because I have something to do.

514
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,235
Don't wait for me for dinner tonight.

515
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,595
You haven't eaten with me for a few days.

516
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,640
What are you going to do today?

517
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,836
Physician Fu is retiring.

518
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,555
Many officials want him

519
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,595
to serve their own residences.

520
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,715
His medical skills are
going to waste in that case.

521
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,635
A capable person like him

522
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,316
must be hired by Wuyong Clinic.

523
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:00,510
You are really good at doing business.

524
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,276
With Physician Fu in
this Wuyong Clinic branch,

525
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,680
Every Wuyong Clinic within the nine states

526
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,756
will get Physician Fu's medicinal formula.

527
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,595
If Physician Fu is willing to leave
a prosperous place like Chang'an,

528
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,115
that means he is not
chasing fame and fortune.

529
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,115
I believe he is willing to save more people

530
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,635
with me.

531
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,756
All right. If I meet him
earlier than other people

532
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,274
and get him to sign a contract,

533
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,356
I will stop all the greedy officials.

534
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,106
I'm leaving.

535
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,149
Ling Ge.

536
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
I purposely got someone to prepare this.

537
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,950
Peach Blossom Donkey-hide Gelatin Cake.

538
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,052
You can eat some every
day to nourish your body.

539
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

540
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,132
- Your Majesty. - Bring it here.

541
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,115
Mu Dan always remembers you.

542
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,320
She always sends the most exquisite
gifts whenever she goes to a new place.

543
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,155
Sui Zhi is heartless.

544
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,235
He only sends me reports of
the officials he investigated.

545
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,235
My mood has been ruined.

546
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,776
I wonder how much effort he has spent

547
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,035
to write this thin piece of report.

548
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,582
San Lang, if you miss him,

549
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,245
why don't you ask him to return
to the capital on New Year's Day?

550
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:48,235
Try it.

551
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,378
Xiao Chun.

552
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,396
Your letter.

553
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,256
- Thank you. - Are you tired?

554
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,306
Chuan Yu, look.

555
00:40:54,421 --> 00:40:55,433
Da Fu.

556
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,039
Pear Blossom Wine sent by Mu Dan.

557
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,796
You are pregnant! You can't drink!

558
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,536
- It's just a small sip. - You can't drink!

559
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,015
Wuyong Clinic has hired Physician Fu!

560
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,973
I'll pack up and look for Mu Dan now.

561
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,436
- That's great. - This wine is good.

562
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,635
Mu Dan sent a painting back.

563
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,796
It's Madam He and Young Master.

564
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,600
- It's beautiful. - Ice Crystal Peonies.

565
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,115
It's so beautiful.

566
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:34,119
As a Touring Inspecting Censor,
you are always investigating

567
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,316
and punishing corrupt
and useless officials.

568
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,356
It's a waste of your talents.

569
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:42,195
My talents can be wasted with
integrity in the political scene.

570
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,976
I also hope business at
the next Wuyong Clinic

571
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,316
is slower.

572
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,675
The world has fewer sufferings
when there are fewer patients.

573
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,491
What about your business?

574
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:55,738
If there are illnesses, I'll sell medicine.

575
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:57,562
If there aren't
illnesses, I'll sell flowers.

576
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,956
If everyone

577
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,316
has no illnesses or poverty in their lives,

578
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,515
with grains in their
home, flowers in their yard,

579
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,476
and people they love,

580
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,515
they'll be living their best days.

581
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,595
All right. I need to go to Wuyong
Clinic to check on the obtained herbs.

582
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:16,772
You may go back.

583
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,195
I'm done with work today.

584
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,491
I'll accompany you.

585
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,316
This is also my selfish wish.

586
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Jiang Da Shan,

587
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,956
you are so clingy.

588
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,996
You were the one who chose me.

589
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:31,756
You can't regret it now.

590
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,115
Let's see if you can chase me!

591
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,721
I'm coming!

592
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:39,276
Jiang Da Shan,
you're too slow!

593
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,436
Dear, wait for me!

594
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Faster!

595
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:59,007
(Thus ends the bloom of youth, )

596
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:03,000
(an empire's beauty is
sealed within the painting.)
