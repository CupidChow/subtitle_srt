1
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:38,236
(In the Name of Blossom)

2
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,800
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,950
Nice...

4
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:47,480
- Dismount!   - Yes.

5
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,640
Make way!

6
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:53,040
Nice...

7
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,303
Lord Pei, you really overestimate me.

8
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,984
Chang Yang is keeping Miss Xiao and Princess Royal company in the palace.

9
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,543
Why would he rush over just for me?

10
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:30,815
To be frank, in his eyes,

11
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,263
I'm just a lowly concubine who earns him money.

12
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,240
When I die, everything I own goes to his household.

13
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,583
If he mourns me for even one day, that's already more than I deserve.

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,344
You've bet on the wrong man.

15
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,877
By the time Chang Yang sobers up tomorrow at home,

16
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,823
he might not even notice I didn't come back.

17
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,063
You poured me wine, but you've got my hands tied.

18
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,503
How am I supposed to drink?

19
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,343
Instead of waiting here with me until dawn,

20
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,223
why don't you untie me first?

21
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,880
I can drink with you under the moonlight. How about it?

22
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,983
Seems I've made the right bet after all.

23
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:32,788
If Jiang Chang Yang dies in front of you,

24
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
I wonder how many days

25
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,343
you will cry.

26
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,280
Jiang Chang Yang!

27
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,160
Don't move!

28
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,640
Drop the sword and send your men out.

29
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:04,400
Now!

30
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,240
Sui Zhi,

31
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,837
since you dote on your concubine,

32
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,663
you should understand the pain of having the one you love taken from you.

33
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,000
There's nothing between Xue Xi and me beyond sibling affection.

34
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:39,160
She's avoiding you because she's still upset about what happened last time.

35
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
Lord Pei, now that you've failed King Ning's command,

36
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,143
you turn your anger on me.

37
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
That hardly seems fair.

38
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
Big talk!

39
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,240
But at the Lantern Festival, you were out and about with her!

40
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,249
You're enjoying the lights with Xue Xi

41
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,663
while still unwilling to let go of your beloved concubine.

42
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,223
You're a philanderer, it doesn't have to be Xue Xi for you,

43
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,783
but I'm different.

44
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,079
With the way you act,

45
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,622
Xue Xi wouldn't marry you even if I'm not here.

46
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,120
For the sake of the Xiao family

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,800
and King Ning's reputation, she kept this matter quiet.

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,680
Lord Pei, why don't you just back off gracefully?

49
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,143
Even if the marriage doesn't happen,

50
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,742
you will have plenty of chances to serve King Ning in future.

51
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,143
But if you provoke the Xiao family or me,

52
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,543
are you not afraid the Emperor will hear of it?

53
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,320
Sui Zhi, I don't mean to turn you into my enemy.

54
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:49,853
It's just…

55
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,835
I'm at my wit's end with Xue Xi.

56
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
If you truly want to ease King Ning's worries,

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,182
then help me out a bit and try to persuade Xue Xi more.

58
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,343
Xue Xi seems fragile, but her will is very strong.

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,920
Once she has decided on something, there's no turning her back.

60
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,063
I can't control whom she chooses to marry.

61
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,200
Fine.

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,025
Thanks for the advice, Sui Zhi.

63
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,382
I was being rash today.

64
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,583
Take her. She's yours.

65
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,742
Leave! It's a trap!

66
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,440
Jiang Chang Yang!

67
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:06,998
Jiang...

68
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,862
If you're gone,

69
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,023
nothing stands between

70
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,543
me and Xue Xi anymore.

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Young Master, catch the sword!

72
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,480
Open the secret chamber!

73
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,943
Someone like you, with such a notorious reputation,

74
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,183
actually has someone willing to die for you.

75
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,343
Absolutely ridiculous.

76
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,463
Open the secret chamber, or I'll kill you now.

77
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,712
I work for King Ning.

78
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,080
You dare to kill me?

79
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,902
Come on. Come on!

80
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,396
- Jiang Chang Yang!   - This sword was granted by the Emperor himself.

81
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,581
Do you think I dare not?

82
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,624
Open it!

83
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,623
Mu Dan?

84
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,160
Mu Dan?

85
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,520
Where is the antidote?

86
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,622
In her condition, even with an antidote,

87
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,943
she may not make it.

88
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,943
If she dies, you will die with her.

89
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,300
The antidote!

90
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,126
Hurry, get the antidote.

91
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes.

92
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,344
Jiang Chang Yang.

93
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,343
So what if you can afford elite guards to protect your life?

94
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,662
You think those noble ladies would ever marry you?

95
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,863
Only a lowly merchant like her

96
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,624
would follow you into hell.

97
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm not killing you now

98
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,262
because her safety matters more than your life.

99
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,223
But if you dare touch her again,

100
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,863
I will kill you.

101
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,063
You act all noble and righteous,

102
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,183
but how are you any better than me?

103
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,757
Everyone knows that you,

104
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,022
Jiang Chang Yang, is a man steeped in sin, with enemies everywhere.

105
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,022
Someone like you

106
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,517
is cursed to implicate your wife, your friends,

107
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,662
be abandoned by everyone, and die alone.

108
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,920
Shut up!

109
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,480
Make way!

110
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,160
Move!

111
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,760
How is she?

112
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,939
Will this poison leave any lasting effects?

113
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,542
When will she wake up?

114
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,198
According to Physician Fu's instructions,

115
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,917
three days of acupuncture will completely purge the remaining poison.

116
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,240
There will be no harm to her health.

117
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,663
She should wake up in about two hours.

118
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,864
You can send someone to prepare some porridge.

119
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,520
Chuan Yu.

120
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,343
It was my poor handling of things that got Mu Dan into this mess.

121
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,463
Pei Zhong was after me.

122
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
She got hurt because of me.

123
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Liu Lang!

124
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,058
If you can't protect her, why don't you let her go?

125
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,316
She only encountered so much danger because she was with you.

126
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,479
That's enough.

127
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,262
It's all my fault. Don't blame him.

128
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,303
You endangered Mu Dan because of your beloved confidante.

129
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,212
What did she ever do wrong?

130
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,783
Why should she suffer this calamity?

131
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,652
Liu Lang, Mu Dan is fine now. Calm down.

132
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,679
She's fine this time, but what about next time?

133
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,304
I only have one sister.

134
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,503
I don't want to lose her.

135
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,662
(Someone like you)

136
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,596
(is cursed to implicate your wife, your friends,)

137
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,782
(abandoned by everyone, and die alone!)

138
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,224
Mu Dan, you're awake.

139
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,139
Da Fu.

140
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:43,646
Mu Dan.

141
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
Liu Lang.

142
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,120
Careful.

143
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,753
Where is Jiang Chang Yang?

144
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:02,387
He's dead.

145
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:05,280
What did you say?

146
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't listen to his nonsense.

147
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:09,189
He's fine, perfectly fine.

148
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,266
Then why isn't he here?

149
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,502
Mu Dan, do you care about him so much?

150
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,542
Are you very disappointed that only Da Fu and I are here guarding you?

151
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,920
You know...

152
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,743
You know that's not what I mean.

153
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,160
Things were dangerous today.

154
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,742
I just can't feel at ease if I don't see him.

155
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,303
He had you and the guards with him. What danger could he possibly face?

156
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:40,552
Enough, Liu Lang.

157
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,742
Lord Jiang is really fine.

158
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,320
He went back already.

159
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,662
Just now, he sent Chuan Yu over with food and some ejiao soup for you.

160
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,343
Mu Dan, when you were in danger, were you truly not afraid of death?

161
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,463
Did you ever think, if something happened to you,

162
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,463
what would I, Da Fu, Xiao Chun, and everyone at Fang Garden

163
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,720
and Blooming Abode do?

164
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,823
At that moment, I didn't have time to think.

165
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
I only knew that

166
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,160
I couldn't let him be in any danger.

167
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:20,382
Mu Dan, you love Jiang Chang Yang with your whole heart.

168
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,863
But what about him? Does he deserve everything you're giving?

169
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,440
Liu Lang.

170
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:31,583
I know you've always been biased against him.

171
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
But do you know about this?

172
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,005
Whether it was Luoyang,

173
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,423
the military camp, or Chang'an,

174
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,064
he pulled me out of the darkness again and again.

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,040
I don't know if he ever asked himself

176
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,480
if it was worth it to treat me that way.

177
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,583
But I know this much.

178
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,022
To die for someone who truly understands you,

179
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,063
one's soul has no regrets.

180
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Jiang Chang Yang.

181
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,364
It's late. The night is cold. You should lie down and rest to recover.

182
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I just came to check things out.

183
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,902
If Liu Lang had hurt you, I wouldn't be able to afford the compensation.

184
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
I would have to move out overnight.

185
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,520
It was a nice Lantern Festival,

186
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,360
and I almost made you miss this full moon.

187
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
You don't have to blame yourself.

188
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,142
You've helped me so much before.

189
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,382
This time, consider it me returning the favor.

190
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,080
I helped you

191
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,915
because I had the means to do so.

192
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,600
What about you?

193
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,022
What do you mean by that?

194
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,863
Our marriage was just a facade, a show for the world.

195
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
It was never built on mutual affection.

196
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,822
There's no need to act like we would live or die for each other.

197
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,200
From now on,

198
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
please don't risk your life for me again.

199
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,080
I come all this way to find you,

200
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,663
and that's what you say to me?

201
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,440
Jiang Chang Yang.

202
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
What's wrong with you?

203
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm just terrified by what happened today.

204
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:31,911
Mu Dan.

205
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,623
I'm truly grateful to have you as a confidante.

206
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,823
That day, in front of King Ning,

207
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,543
you helped me hide the secret chamber,

208
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,920
and I was already incredibly grateful.

209
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,072
But today,

210
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,464
you risked your life to save me.

211
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,960
To me,

212
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,064
that's a weight I can't carry.

213
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,040
A weight?

214
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,880
You are He Wei Fang,

215
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,438
the Chief Flower Merchant of the State,

216
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,763
the owner of Blooming Abode.

217
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,903
You rely on no one.

218
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,343
You've carved out a fragrant world all your own.

219
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,222
You were born to live freely.

220
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,542
You're not meant to bow or break for anything, or anyone.

221
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,263
Least of all, to risk your life for them.

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,160
You're right.

223
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:01,153
Live freely.

224
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,463
That's how I should be.

225
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,080
You're right.

226
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:09,826
I hear you.

227
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,663
From this moment on,

228
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,079
we don't owe each other anything.

229
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,320
Confidante.

230
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,793
Young Master.

231
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:25,063
No need.

232
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,360
Young Master, have you really thought this through?

233
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,487
Are you truly giving up on confessing your feelings?

234
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,920
After what happened, I've become clear-headed.

235
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm used to countless dangers,

236
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,782
but how can I ask her to get used to them too?

237
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:55,542
It was selfish of me to try to keep her by my side.

238
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,360
Take

239
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:04,692
all these down.

240
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,423
I've walked the long night alone for too long.

241
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,223
I no longer dare

242
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,693
to hope for the sunrise.

243
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,623
It's already a blessing to have a moon to gaze at from afar.

244
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,663
Why should I turn that moon

245
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,465
into a paper lantern?

246
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,216
If I fail in the end,

247
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:37,732
it would only force her

248
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,423
to go down with me.

249
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,903
But everyone thinks Madam He is your beloved concubine.

250
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,317
Even if you were truly together,

251
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,143
the situation wouldn't be any different from now.

252
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,386
As long as I don't reveal my feelings,

253
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,464
if there is another crisis,

254
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,463
I can persuade her to leave as a friend.

255
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,703
But if she knew my true feelings,

256
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,142
given her personality,

257
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,143
no matter what danger she faced,

258
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,782
she would never abandon me.

259
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,104
I'm not afraid of death,

260
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:24,272
but I'm afraid

261
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,022
of her dying because of me.

262
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,943
But Young Master, I think...

263
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,200
And that Pei Zhong...

264
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,880
Tell She Yan

265
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:51,579
to deal with him the usual way.

266
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,400
Young Master.

267
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,764
All of King Ning's hidden forces in Chang'an

268
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,418
are under Pei Zhong's command.

269
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,983
If She Yan follows this lead,

270
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,782
he can quickly uncover all of King Ning's military strength.

271
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,062
If we kill Pei Zhong now,

272
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,423
King Ning will replace him, and we may lose our only lead.

273
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,685
Our great cause hasn't succeeded yet.

274
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:13,143
Please reconsider, Young Master.

275
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,824
I can spare his life,

276
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,423
but Mu Dan's vengeance

277
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:25,565
must be paid.

278
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,502
A gentleman might wait 10 years for revenge,

279
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,143
but Flower Bird Envoy

280
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,623
can just act for personal justice.

281
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,880
Yes.

282
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,153
Let go of me!

283
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:56,623
Jiang Chang Yang, you dog!

284
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,583
Jiang Chang Yang!

285
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,342
He's so unscrupulous.

286
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,006
Not only did he injure and humiliate me,

287
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,687
but he also spread the news all over Chang'an.

288
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,663
Now I've become a laughingstock.

289
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,360
What he did...

290
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,423
He openly defied you, My Lord.

291
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,342
My Lord, please grant me justice.

292
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,903
Judgment rests on evidence, not emotion.

293
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,903
He left no proof.

294
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,784
How can I pass judgment based solely on your word?

295
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,663
I witnessed it personally.

296
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,582
The man who led the attack on me was his guard.

297
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,423
Besides you,

298
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,302
are there any other witnesses?

299
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,480
You set him up.

300
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,142
Given his personality,

301
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,822
the fact he only gave you a few cuts is him showing restraint on my behalf.

302
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,623
Xue Xi came to see me the other day.

303
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,040
Guess what she told me?

304
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:09,319
I don't know.

305
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,342
You two are fighting over her,

306
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,782
but Xue Xi defended Jiang Chang Yang with every word.

307
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,704
When it comes to charming women,

308
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,943
perhaps you should learn from him.

309
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,633
My Lord, Jiang Chang Yang is a scoundrel...

310
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:27,714
Just admit you've lost to him.

311
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,542
If you still had some grace, perhaps you could turn the tide.

312
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,143
Xue Xi's affections aren't important.

313
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,463
What's important is the Xiao family.

314
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Do not neglect them.

315
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,600
Yes.

316
00:26:52,622 --> 00:26:53,702
(Fang Garden)

317
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:04,873
Mu Dan!

318
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:06,246
What's wrong?

319
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
We finally waited for the ships to resume sailing,

320
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:10,410
but our ships bound south have all been blocked.

321
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,560
Why?

322
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,360
I asked around.

323
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,623
The people at the dock were polite but evasive.

324
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,583
They said the order came from above.

325
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,640
What's your purpose in stopping my merchant ships?

326
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,143
I've been promoted today. I'm no longer a deputy.

327
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,600
And today...

328
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,360
There's nothing special.

329
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,143
I just want to see you.

330
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,336
Join me for a drink and watch the sunset.

331
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,104
Your ships can surely sail tomorrow.

332
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,582
My trade route isn't limited to this one waterway.

333
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,102
Commissioner of Transport, please allow me to move my goods.

334
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,423
My shop is very busy, so I must excuse myself.

335
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,463
Here, take this. It'll ensure smooth passage.

336
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,680
I only ask for a moment of your time today.

337
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,523
Just a moment.

338
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,143
Why do you keep avoiding me?

339
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,200
I avoided you,

340
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,360
and yet my house was set on fire and raided.

341
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,647
If you keep bothering me,

342
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,024
I might lose my life next.

343
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,480
That's because you're with Jiang Chang Yang.

344
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:00,820
He and Pei Zhong were fighting over a woman,

345
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,640
and you ended up poisoned.

346
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,303
You'll never know peace if you stay with a man like him.

347
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,222
I heard that broken limbs are hardest to bear when it's cold.

348
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,423
Lord Liu, you have two braziers in your room.

349
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,623
I assume your injury is still hurting.

350
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,222
Don't forget,

351
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,943
you are the son-in-law of King Ning.

352
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,080
King Ning is wise and magnanimous.

353
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,703
If you serve King Ning well,

354
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,400
every trade route in the land will open to you.

355
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,920
Blooming Abode will open branches across the country within three years.

356
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,302
So, all this talk about forcing me to appear was just for money.

357
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,702
Why pretend to be sentimental?

358
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,880
When I'm with outsiders, I endure humiliation for a greater cause.

359
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,400
That is to clear our future obstacles.

360
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,502
But with you, I've never pretended.

361
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't you love peonies?

362
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,320
Once Blooming Abode is established throughout the land,

363
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,142
we can spend winters in the south.

364
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,463
I can ensure your surroundings are always filled with peonies.

365
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,139
Liu Chang.

366
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,368
You amuse me.

367
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,423
We were just at each other's throats,

368
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,840
and now you're here putting on a show of deep affection.

369
00:30:58,918 --> 00:31:02,542
All your endurance is merely for your own ambition,

370
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,304
for your own selfish desires.

371
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,646
This is not love.

372
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,920
This is not love?

373
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,542
When I learned you were going to marry Jiang Chang Yang,

374
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,383
I felt like rotten mud,

375
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,744
imprisoned in that filthy dungeon.

376
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,261
That heartbreak hurt more than this crippled leg ever could.

377
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,440
Is that not love?

378
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,523
Do you know what love is?

379
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,463
True love means loving who they love,

380
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,143
hurting when they hurt.

381
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,240
It means letting go, not holding them captive.

382
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,077
Love is not a sword meant to wound.

383
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
It's the bright moon,

384
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,663
quietly watching over, enduring forever.

385
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,466
Do you really love Jiang Chang Yang?

386
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes.

387
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:01,646
That's impossible!

388
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,143
Jiang Chang Yang is corrupt, reckless and shameless.

389
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,920
What makes him worthy of your affection?

390
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,264
I didn't understand what love was either.

391
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,801
But Jiang Chang Yang showed me what it means to truly love someone.

392
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,663
And you're the complete opposite.

393
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,102
You disregarded the Princess and repeatedly pestered me.

394
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,240
It provoked her jealousy and drove her to burn Fang Garden.

395
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,984
You hurt everyone.

396
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,320
Liu Chang.

397
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:39,623
I'm now married to the man I love.

398
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,760
Whatever was between us ended a long time ago.

399
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,702
Treat the Princess well.

400
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,520
Stop clinging to this obsession.

401
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,223
Ended long ago?

402
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,440
What are you doing?

403
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,367
Go away!

404
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
Don't come closer!

405
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,022
Do you hate me that much?

406
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,720
Give it to me.

407
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,720
Don't hurt yourself.

408
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,559
You're overthinking.

409
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,742
Why would I hurt myself over someone like you?

410
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,085
Don't move!

411
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,200
Liu Chang.

412
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,923
This is my final warning.

413
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,582
If you ever dare to harm me or anyone I love again in the future,

414
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:43,519
I will draw my sword against you,

415
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:45,889
even if it means we both go down.

416
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,222
Why are you back so late?

417
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,582
Today is your birthday.

418
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,062
Why did you go drinking alone?

419
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,463
The night is still young. How about I join you for a few drinks?

420
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,943
You threw aside your pride

421
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,263
just celebrate the birthday of the one you love.

422
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,384
But things didn't go as expected.

423
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,983
The other person doesn't feel the same.

424
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,423
Why do you keep torturing yourself?

425
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,823
Your birthday coincides with your promotion,

426
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,463
so I prepared this jade crown as a celebration.

427
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,903
Zi Shu, do you want to try it on?

428
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,400
No need.

429
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,919
If you don't like it, just tell me. I'll take it away.

430
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,983
Why did you have to destroy it right in front of me?

431
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,040
To relentlessly seek something

432
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,343
and never attain it...

433
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,343
We are just equally

434
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,200
tragic.

435
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,400
Did Liu Chang hurt you?

436
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,120
Lord Jiang, you're making a big fuss.

437
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,146
If I had come back any later,

438
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,142
you probably would've been heading out with your sword to start a massacre.

439
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,742
Aren't you worried about King Ning and the Princess turning against you?

440
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,382
If I had gone, I would've naturally prepared my excuses

441
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,263
so it wouldn't reach King Ning.

442
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,463
Of course, Lord Jiang always has a plan.

443
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,720
But

444
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:53,823
why would you go to such lengths for just a friend?

445
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Doesn't this hurt your reputation as Flower Bird Envoy?

446
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:57,625
I...

447
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
Liu Chang has taken over the canal transport.

448
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,000
It's not just your merchant fleet.

449
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,182
Any venture that can't profit King Ning will face travel restrictions.

450
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,622
And those ships that travel freely

451
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:17,783
are engaged in illicit transport of treasures and reselling tribute goods.

452
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,640
Liu Chang's influence is extensive, and he has provoked much discontent.

453
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,080
I just don't want to see you dragged into it.

454
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,360
I don't hold on to what's meant to be over.

455
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,440
After seeing Liu Chang today,

456
00:39:38,866 --> 00:39:41,263
everything that needed to be said has been made clear.

457
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,102
Any misguided thoughts have been severed.

458
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,880
Please rest assured, Lord Jiang.

459
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,560
That's good.

460
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,702
As the owner of Blooming Abode,

461
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:05,023
anything that happens in the shop is my responsibility.

462
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,222
It's only right that I handle it myself.

463
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,062
Lord Jiang, I hope you can trust my abilities,

464
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
and stop worrying over my affairs.

465
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,422
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

466
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:21,137
Confidante.

467
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:52,242
Young Master.

468
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,622
Why don't you tell Madam He we will get rid of Liu Chang in three days?

469
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,040
Her merchant ships will then have smooth passage.

470
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:02,088
If Madam He is pleased,

471
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:05,440
maybe she won't be so cold toward you.

472
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,360
I chose this path. I'll bear the consequences.

473
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,720
Don't talk too much in front of her.

474
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:17,623
Yes.
