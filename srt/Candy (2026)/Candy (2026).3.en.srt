1
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,839
Xiao He.

2
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,639
Are you really cutting it short?

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Cut it.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Shorter.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,399
Even shorter.

6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,680
It should be even shorter.

7
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
It can't go any shorter.

8
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,200
Any shorter and you'll look like a boy.

9
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,800
It won't look good at all.

10
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,519
That's perfect.

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,840
No.

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I don't agree.

13
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,600
"Candy"

14
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
(Episode 2: Take Recharging Seriously)

15
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,199
Wen Nuannuan.

16
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
Have you thought about how to pay me back?

17
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,479
Don't go.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Don't leave me.

19
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,199
Help me dry my hair.

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Put this on.

21
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,479
No...
It's fine.

22
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,680
I don't want to trouble you.

23
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,960
You want to go out like this?

24
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,599
I'll wear it.

25
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,280
Does she like clothes in this style now too?

26
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,039
Um…

27
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,319
I need to change.

28
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,439
If you want me to help you change,

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,719
I wouldn't say no.

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,039
No, no, it's fine!

31
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Could you…

32
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,479
close your eyes first?

33
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
Hmm.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Done.

35
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:32,800
Not bad.

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Fits well.

37
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,079
I think so too.

38
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,399
Didn't expect…

39
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,560
you to like this style of clothes now.

40
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,720
No,

41
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,239
I prepared it for someone else.

42
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,399
What are you thinking?

43
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Trying to run again?

44
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,879
Teacher Lin Can.

45
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
It's getting late,

46
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,759
you should get some rest.

47
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,639
First,

48
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,160
given our relationship,

49
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,279
don't call me "Teacher Lin Can" from now on.

50
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:06,800
Second,

51
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,399
I'm not tired.

52
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,519
I like staying up late.

53
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,800
But…

54
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
I live pretty far away.

55
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,480
In a bit,

56
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,399
the last bus will leave...

57
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,519
You're staying here tonight.

58
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,959
That's not okay.

59
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,879
I should really go back.

60
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:21,879
Relax.

61
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,240
There are toiletries.

62
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,120
But it's too much trouble for you.

63
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,600
I'll just go home.

64
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,439
What's wrong?

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
My head hurts a bit.

66
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,879
And my stomach feels off.

67
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,920
Is it from the alcohol earlier?

68
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Probably had too much.

69
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:54,800
It's fine.

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,279
I can tough it out.

71
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,800
If you want to go back,

72
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
then go.

73
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,334
["Pain in the Ass" calling]

74
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,199
Lin Can.

75
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,399
You finally picked up.

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,839
Hello, Sister Si Han.

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's Nuannuan.

78
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Nuannuan?

79
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Is Lin Can home?

80
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,439
Is she okay?

81
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,399
She's home, yes,

82
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,160
That's good.

83
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,399
Let me talk to her.

84
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,879
Sorry, Sister Si Han,

85
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
Teacher Lin Can is drunk,

86
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,240
and she's passed out now.

87
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,639
What should I do?

88
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
Drunk again?

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,480
Okay.

90
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,639
Don't worry, Nuannuan.

91
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,079
Lin Can has anemia and gastritis,

92
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
so she faints easily when drunk.

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,959
Please stay and take care of her.

94
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,879
Xiao He.

95
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,759
How have you been all these years?

96
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,319
Hello?

97
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,199
Nuannuan?

98
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,199
I'm here, I'm here.

99
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,079
Good.

100
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:07,879
Nuannuan,

101
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,456
listen carefully to what I say next.

102
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Remember it clearly.

103
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,079
Lin Can gets stomach cramps when drunk.

104
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Have stomach medicine ready.

105
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,480
It's in the third layer of the medicine cabinet.

106
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
Also, before she sobers up,

107
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,120
prepare warm milk in advance.

108
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,279
The milk is in the fridge.

109
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,319
Remember, use the yellow cup specifically.

110
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,160
All cups have specific uses.

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,319
Don't mix them up.

112
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I see it.

113
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,399
Hold on, Sister Si Han.

114
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,000
That's about it.

115
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,159
Oh,

116
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,000
also get some candy.

117
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,720
Candy?

118
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
And one more thing…

119
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,639
Sister Si Han,

120
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,799
right now,

121
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,039
I have no hands,

122
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,159
no feet…

123
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,919
Candy helps calm her
intense emotions after drinking.

124
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,279
When she's drunk,

125
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,279
she can be pretty scary.

126
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,519
Nuannuan,

127
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,399
be careful, okay?

128
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,799
I'll go do it now.

129
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,159
I have things to do,

130
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,480
you take care of Lin Can first.

131
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Okay.

132
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,679
Xiao He.

133
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,039
We promised.

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,399
We'd never be apart.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You promised.

136
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Hmm.

137
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,639
Xiao He.

138
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,759
My head hurts…

139
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,799
My stomach hurts…

140
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
You're awake?

141
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,960
How do you feel?

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Any better?

143
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,519
Oh,

144
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,159
Sister Si Han said

145
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,039
you need stomach medicine for cramps.

146
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,919
And,

147
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,159
warm milk.

148
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,159
Did a burglar break into my house?

149
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,759
Sister Si Han gave a lot of instructions.

150
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,080
I couldn't find some things.

151
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
So…

152
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh right!

153
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,159
Candy.

154
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Sister Si Han said

155
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,320
candy helps calm you down.

156
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
But…

157
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,559
Sister Si Han seems really concerned about you.

158
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Jealous?

159
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
No.

160
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,759
Then sleep with me tonight.

161
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Okay.

162
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,080
Online rumors say your studio is
involved in fraudulent invoicing,

163
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,639
with tax evasion over seven figures.

164
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:26,600
Is it true

165
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,720
that's how you bought the limited-edition motorcycle?

166
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,240
During the tax scandal,

167
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,000
you still showed off riding it?

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is that true?

169
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
Tax evasion to get
the car you bought?

170
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,655
Don't you think
you're letting your fans down?

171
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,639
Nonsense!

172
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:39,025
Oh my god!

173
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,679
Really?

174
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
You really bought this for me?

175
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,879
From now on, no rejecting any work offers.

176
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,639
Why?

177
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,320
Because after this,

178
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,039
we have to pay off the car installments.

179
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,279
Where's my money?

180
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,320
That's so crazy.

181
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,600
Then please explain

182
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
snatching the female lead role from actress Jiang Wan.

183
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
That's true, right?

184
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,000
I saw it myself.

185
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,240
She can blame her own poor acting.

186
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,799
Why blame someone else?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,519
You were seen on the new drama set

188
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,976
acting intimate with the married director.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,296
Multiple instances of
physical contact occurred.

190
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,274
Are your acting resources all obtained?

191
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,082
That one is definitely fake.

192
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,948
It's 50/50.

193
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,480
Look,

194
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,399
your palm lines, show you'll
be hugely successful this year.

195
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Please don't.

196
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Let me tell you,

197
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,959
this isn't the first time, is it?

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
If I see you

199
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,080
touching actresses inappropriately again,

200
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,279
you'll regret it.

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
In the future,

202
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,919
you won't hit me, will you?

203
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,759
Depends on your behavior.

204
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,360
And the rumors about you and your agent, Si
Han, being a lesbian couple are everywhere.

205
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,519
Is it true or not?

206
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,200
Right.

207
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Did something happen between you two?

208
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,279
Are the rumors true or not?

209
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,679
Please respond.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,519
And the gossip about her and her agent Si Han,

211
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,519
is it true or not?

212
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,519
Who knows?

213
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,759
Gotta say though,

214
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,919
they look good together.

215
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,919
Home by 3 a.m.

216
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,559
Watch your mouth in front of the media.

217
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,279
So you and Sister Si Han…

218
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Have some milk.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't want it.

220
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Sorry.

221
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,919
Mentioning Sister Si Han upset you.

222
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,080
But drinking hurts your body,

223
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,639
have something warm.

224
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,879
Who said I'm upset?

225
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Just tired of the news.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,399
All of that is stuff they made up.

227
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,759
Don't take it to heart.

228
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,799
Being in this industry so long,

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,559
if I got angry at everything they say,

230
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,680
I'd have died from rage long ago.

231
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,279
Feed me.

232
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Feed me.

233
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Monster.

234
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,759
After all these years apart,

235
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
how did you become like this?

236
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,440
Assistant Rule Number One:

237
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,799
No gossiping about me behind my back.

238
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,360
I didn't say anything.

239
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,519
Not even in your mind.

240
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Sleepy.

241
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,039
Come sleep with me.

242
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,879
But

243
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,440
I still have work to do.

244
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Go to sleep now.

245
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,159
We have work tomorrow.

246
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,440
But I can't sleep.

247
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I'm sleepy.

248
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Xiao He.

249
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,279
Being by your side

250
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,799
feels so unreal.

251
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,679
Who hit you?

252
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
My mom.

253
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,639
She saw this haircut,

254
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,720
didn't like it,

255
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
and beat me up.

256
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:53,320
Hmph.

257
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,960
You can still laugh?

258
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Here.

259
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,399
I saved for a week to buy this.

260
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,759
I was going to give it
to you on your birthday.

261
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,799
Thanks.

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Feed me a bit.

263
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,679
Open up.

264
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Still hurts?

265
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,480
Xiao He,

266
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
don't scare me.

267
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,039
You tricked me again.

268
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
So annoying.

269
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
You folded this?

270
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,279
Hmm.

271
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,679
For you.

272
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,919
It's ugly.

273
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Ugly? Give it back.

274
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
Give it back to me.

275
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,615
Are you giving it back or not?

276
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,639
Give it back!

277
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,399
Stop tickling me!

278
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,039
Give it back!

279
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:49,440
No!

280
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Give it back!

281
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Xiao He.

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Seeing you again

283
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
is so good.

284
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Xiao He.

285
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,799
From now on,

286
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,039
come live at my place.

287
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,519
I'll protect you.

288
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Having you is so good.

289
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,480
Good morning!

290
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Teacher Lin Can.

291
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,559
Good morning,

292
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Young Miss.

293
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Sorry,

294
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,359
I overslept by accident.

295
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,880
This…

296
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,200
is for me?

297
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Hmm.

298
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
I threw away your old clothes.

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
As my assistant,

300
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,399
you need to dress stylishly.

301
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,880
These are too expensive.

302
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,079
I can't accept them.

303
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,200
They're deducted from your salary.

304
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,279
Alright.

305
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,160
Drink up.

306
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
We have work later.

307
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,079
What's wrong?

308
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
I want you to take a good look.

309
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,400
Sister Si Han is here.

310
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Morning, Sister Si Han.

311
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Morning.

312
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Nuannuan's here too.

313
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,079
Seems you two get along well.

314
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,319
That puts me at ease.

315
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,519
Sister Si Han, don't misunderstand.

316
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,839
Teacher Lin Can and I

317
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,640
just slept together innocently last night.

318
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Not "slept together,"

319
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,240
not that kind of sleeping together.

320
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,559
I…

321
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
We didn't do anything.

322
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
It's not like that.

323
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Sister Si Han,

324
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,880
I…

325
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,079
I really don't want to ruin your relationship.

326
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,359
Alright.

327
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,640
Ready? Get in the car.

328
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,799
Let's get going.

329
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,519
Where to?

330
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,680
So many questions.

331
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Get in.

332
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,920
I heard they hired Lin Can for this ad.

333
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,519
Lin Can?

334
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,279
She's been surrounded by bad press lately.

335
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,039
Wonder what her condition is like. Yeah.

336
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,599
Hot, isn't it?

337
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:39,920
Yeah.

338
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,400
Hope she doesn't delay our shoot.

339
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,039
Everyone ready?

340
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,400
Let's start if ready.

341
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:48,880
Over here.

342
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,519
Okay, Teacher Lin Can.

343
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,159
Tilt your head a bit more this way.

344
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,279
Yes.

345
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,319
Perfect.

346
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,079
Good.

347
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,400
So beautiful.

348
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,079
I didn't expect Lin Can
to be so professional at work.

349
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,200
A top-tier star indeed.

350
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,119
She's totally different
from how she is at home.

351
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,519
Sorry, Sister Si Han,

352
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,960
I didn't mean it like that.

353
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,519
I just genuinely admire Teacher Lin Can.

354
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
It's fine.

355
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,559
Why so nervous?

356
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,920
You

357
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,079
aren't angry?

358
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Why would I be angry?

359
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,839
I didn't expect Sister Si
Han to be so understanding.

360
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
What's going on?

361
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,200
Should be wrapping up by now.

362
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,400
Teacher Si Han,

363
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
so sorry,

364
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,240
the director suddenly had new ideas,

365
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,599
he wants to shoot a few more looks.

366
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,200
You see,

367
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,416
according to the contract,

368
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Lin Can's schedule for today is done.

369
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,159
No wonder they say Teacher Lin Can is a diva.

370
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Excuse me,

371
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,839
it must be tough.

372
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,319
What?

373
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Nothing.

374
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,319
I just think

375
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,480
since you hate Lin Can so much,

376
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,960
serving her here is so pitiful.

377
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,599
You're just an assistant too,

378
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,319
no better than me.

379
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,720
Right,

380
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
I am an assistant.

381
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,640
But Teacher Lin Can pays me

382
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
this much.

383
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
Alright, Nuannuan,

384
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
take me to change.

385
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,640
Sister Si Han,

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
what do we do?

387
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,400
Leaving now

388
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,160
will just give them more to talk about.

389
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,999
You take care of Lin Can first.

390
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,160
I need to handle something.

391
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Okay.

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What,

393
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,079
feeling sorry for me?

394
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,119
They're bullying you.

395
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
By the way,

396
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,519
can your body handle it?

397
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,440
My battery's dead.

398
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,799
I need to recharge.

399
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Recharge?

400
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,000
And how does one recharge?

401
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:21,799
Recharge.

402
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Like this?

403
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,960
Feeling better?

404
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Far from it.

405
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
Take it more seriously.

406
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,119
Like this?

407
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,359
A little better.

408
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,359
But to fully charge,

409
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
it'll take a while.

410
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Then…

411
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:58,920
Then…

412
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,960
what do we do?

413
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,039
Kiss me.

414
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,359
Kiss you?

415
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,000
Hmm.

416
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,800
One kiss and I'll be fully charged.

417
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I don't know how.

418
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:22,880
It's simple.

419
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Got it?

420
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,519
Fully charged.

421
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Back to work.

422
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,920
Go, Teacher Lin Can!

423
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,000
After this set,

424
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,119
we have one more!

425
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,840
Truly impressive, Teacher Lin Can.

426
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,799
Wind, a bit stronger.

427
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Stronger wind!

428
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,319
Remember,

429
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,839
the next set is royal style.

430
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,160
The set after is the black dress.

431
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,759
Miss Jiang,

432
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:25,079
since when do you care about the shooting schedule?

433
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,599
Si Han.

434
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,160
Stop shooting!

435
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Stop the wind!

436
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
It's twisted.

437
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,839
Does it hurt?

438
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
It's fine.

439
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,039
"Fine"?

440
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,799
Your foot is swollen.

441
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,240
I'll record you all

442
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,400
and post it online.

443
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Let everyone see

444
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,559
how you bully Lin Can.

445
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,400
No, no,

446
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,519
let's talk this over.

447
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,240
Teacher Lin Can,

448
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
rest for a bit.

449
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,079
Better?

450
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,559
I'm really fine.

451
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Xiao He,

452
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
all these years,

453
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,599
have you been struggling like this?

454
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,266
I have too much bad press now.

455
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,240
Who knows how far the rumors will go.

456
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,759
Before that,

457
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,880
I want to do my current work well.

458
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
It's okay.

459
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,880
Si Han,

460
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,359
I just…

461
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,599
Just what?

462
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,519
Jiang Wan,

463
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,160
all you know how to do

464
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,319
is these sneaky, underhanded things.

465
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,359
What else can you do?

466
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Si Han,

467
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
don't forget,

468
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,720
it was you and I who went through those tough
times when we couldn't pay rent, not Lin Can.

469
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,640
You and I ended long ago.

470
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,160
Don't use these tricks anymore.

471
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,319
You know I hate it most—

472
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,319
Know what?

473
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,799
Hate me the most?

474
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,976
The suffering I've endured these years,

475
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,040
what do you know about it?

476
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Not my concern.

477
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
A word of advice:

478
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,319
focus more on yourself.

479
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,379
If you're really bored,

480
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
work on improving your acting.

481
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
How long do you think you can
protect that bitch?

482
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,399
Let me tell you the truth.

483
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,759
Lin Can will soon be nothing.

484
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Jiang Wan,

485
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,240
what are you scheming now?

486
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,760
You don't know yet, do you?

487
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
To silence the public,

488
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,599
the company decided to blacklist Lin Can
completely, withdrawing all her resources.

489
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
What nonsense!

490
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Si Han,

491
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,640
if you knew this day would come,

492
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,079
would you still be her dog?

493
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
What else?

494
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,440
Be your little lapdog instead, Miss Jiang?

495
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Still so stubborn.

496
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,319
But...

497
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,599
I like it.

498
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Sister Si Han!

499
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,599
Jiang Wan,

500
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,079
so it was you behind all this.

501
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
So what if it was?

502
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,200
Lin Can,

503
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,519
your days are numbered.

504
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
It's fine.

505
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,240
I expected this day
ever since the tax scandal.

506
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,279
What "highly sought-after top star,"

507
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,759
"limited-edition motorcycle,"

508
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,920
"luxury mansion"—

509
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
starting now,

510
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,200
you're nothing.

511
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,799
Jiang Wan,

512
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,560
instead of worrying about others,

513
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,799
worry about yourself.

514
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,880
Maybe my today

515
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,400
is your tomorrow.

516
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,319
Let's go.

517
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Lin Can,

518
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,279
Sister Si Han,

519
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,079
is what Jiang Wan said true?

520
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,319
What's really going on?

521
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
It's true.

522
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
What do we do?

523
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,839
Now I have nothing.

524
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,839
I'll have to rely on you to support me.

525
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,359
It's okay,

526
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
I'll support you.

527
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,839
So, Miss Nuannuan,

528
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,479
how do you plan to support Lin Can?

529
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
From what Jiang Wan said,

530
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,200
Lin Can's house

531
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,440
will probably be gone soon too.

532
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,440
Now you won't even have a place to stay.

533
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,440
It's fine.

534
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:12,799
Move in with me.

535
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,119
I'll protect you.

536
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,319
Okay.

537
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Let's move now.

538
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,119
So soon?

539
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,119
But my place is tiny

540
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and a bit messy.

541
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,599
Don't look down on it.

542
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Silly.

543
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,079
A big star like me

544
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,839
would never live in such a place.

545
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,759
Be grateful you have a place.

546
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Still complaining.

547
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,640
Si Han,

548
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,279
come to my place for a drink.

549
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,400
Another time.

550
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,720
I have things to do later.

551
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,719
Then Nuannuan, stay with me.

552
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,119
Okay.

553
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,440
I think this job is pretty fun.

554
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
What's going on?

555
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
What are you all doing?

556
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
(Easter egg)

557
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:26,640
See my hairpin?

558
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Pretty?

559
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,000
Bought it new.

560
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Nice, right?

561
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,519
Xiao He, Xiao He,

562
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,519
come out for a sec.

563
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:45,279
What's happening?

564
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
And they have gifts?

565
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Three girls.

566
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,519
She's coming out.

567
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,759
Today is Valentine's Day.

568
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,400
This is my gift for you.

569
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,279
And mine.

570
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,279
And mine.

571
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,039
She accepted it.

572
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,039
Let's go.

573
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,039
Today's Valentine's Day.

574
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,680
Those girls,

575
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,039
are they confessing to Xiao He?

576
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,319
Can't be helped.

577
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,039
Ever since Xiao He cut her hair short,

578
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,879
all the girls at school are crazy about her.
