1
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,679
Finally became a shining star.

2
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,239
But…

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,600
Are you still blaming me?

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Do you still remember me?

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,400
I've gotten used to this kind of life already.

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
But some people's presence…

7
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,000
is just like candy.

8
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,319
You think you've long forgotten how it tastes,

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
only to realize…

10
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:15,120
it's already ingrained in your bones.

11
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,680
Take a deep breath, follow my rhythm.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
When…

13
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,120
will I finally find you?

14
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,700
"Candy"

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
(Episode 1: No Crying After Candy)

16
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,719
It's reported that your studio is suspected
of issuing fake invoices.

17
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,159
Lin Can,

18
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,496
the amount of tax evasion exceeds seven figures.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,159
Is this how you purchased
that limited edition luxury car?

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
During the tax scandal,

21
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,735
you still showed up publicly.

22
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,080
Tell us,
are you taunting the public?

23
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,840
And the rumors about you and your agent Si Han...

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
the lesbian gossip is everywhere.

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Is it true or not?

26
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,800
Regarding these questions,

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,520
the studio will appoint

28
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,936
a dedicated legal team to handle them.

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,400
We cannot disclose specific details.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
If you care about Lin
Can's work, how about...

31
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,159
What about snatching the female lead role
from actress Jiang Wan?

32
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,159
How do you explain that?

33
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,159
Yeah!

34
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,000
Answer that!

35
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,560
Answer us!

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
You were seen on the new drama set

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,376
being intimate with a married director,

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
with repeated physical contact.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,319
So…

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,120
are all your leading roles

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
obtained through such improper behavior?

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,919
I never thought Lin Can was so rotten.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,759
I've wasted all these years supporting her.

44
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,759
Everyone, friends from the media,

45
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,080
regarding these online rumors,

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,479
we've prepared statements from our lawyers.

47
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,936
We won't respond to personal questions.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
Top star Lin Can flees in guilt!

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,879
Where is she?

50
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,479
Over there!

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:18,960
After her!

52
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,319
Hurry!

53
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:24,568
(Si Han: When you've gotten
somewhere safe, send your location.

54
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,407
The company strongly warns you
against responding to the media.)

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
Xiao He.

56
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,039
Come here!

57
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,439
Nuannuan.

58
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,079
Where are you?

59
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,240
Sorry, sorry.

60
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,959
Had enough filming?

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,720
Filming secretly is a violation of privacy...

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,480
it's illegal.

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Want me to call the police?

64
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,600
I...

65
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,360
What a thorough disguise.

66
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,279
Let me see

67
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,519
what you've filmed.

68
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,120
I didn't...

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I didn't film anything.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,079
I didn't film a thing.

71
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,759
I was just buying groceries and heading home.

72
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,399
Dressed like that…

73
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,639
for groceries?

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,199
I was just hiding from my landlord.

75
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh, right.

76
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,199
What did you say earlier?

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
You're a celebrity?

78
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
You don't know me?

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
My bad.

80
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,959
I misunderstood.

81
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,160
How about…

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
I give you an autograph?

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
No, thanks.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
A photo?

85
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
A photo then?

86
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,879
No need.

87
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,199
I really don't know you.

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
I'll head back now.

89
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,160
Fine.

90
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Don't know me, huh?

91
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,399
Now you know me?

92
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,079
I still don't know you.

93
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm still going home.

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Xiao He.

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,839
It's so good to see you.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
But…

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
We're not in the same world anymore.

98
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,879
She went into this alley.

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,439
After her!

100
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,480
Go that way.

101
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
Quick, quick!

102
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,199
Don't be scared.

103
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,439
I'll take you away.

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Don't be scared.

105
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,639
I'll take you away.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Hurry!

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
We're here.

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,639
Go that way.

109
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,639
Okay.

110
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,040
So-sorry...

111
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,519
Did I grip too tight?

112
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,519
Didn't you say you don't know me?

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Why help me out then?

114
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,439
Give me your phone.

115
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:26,325
When did you move back?

116
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:28,738
(Three years earlier)

117
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:30,839
Who are you?

118
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
What are you doing loitering outside my door?

119
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,816
Where's the previous resident here?

120
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,440
Moved out long ago.

121
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
It's my place now.

122
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,639
My aunt sold my house.

123
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
I barely managed to rent it back.

124
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,199
This was originally your parents' home.

125
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,960
They lived here,

126
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
yet dared to sell it?

127
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,039
Are you a rabbit?

128
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,440
All vegetables.

129
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,799
So skinny.

130
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,080
Don't you eat anything decent?

131
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,399
It's just that…

132
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,360
Wen Nuannuan, open up!

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,240
I know you're home.

134
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,559
Oh no.

135
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,200
The landlord's here for rent.

136
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,559
Open up!

137
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,559
I'll handle it.

138
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,559
Hurry, open up!

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,120
No need.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,759
You can hide today, but not forever.

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,039
I know...

142
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,879
I'll handle it.

143
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,600
You just graduated, no job.

144
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,879
Why not just follow me?

145
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,159
Rent's free.

146
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll take you out to eat every day.

147
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:23,799
Who are you?

148
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm her creditor.

149
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,559
You're a creditor too?

150
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,639
Wen Nuannuan,

151
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,799
how come you owe everyone?

152
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,720
If you don't pay the rent today,

153
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,279
pack your things and get out.

154
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,000
I know...

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,440
you just graduated, no job.

156
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,759
Why not just follow me?

157
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,679
Rent's free.

158
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,039
I'll take you out to eat every day.

159
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,039
You're recording me?

160
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,159
About the rent...

161
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,159
someone will contact you today to settle it.

162
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,080
If you harass her again,

163
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,240
this recording

164
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,679
goes to my lawyer.

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,960
Hey, miss...

166
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,320
let's talk this out nicely.

167
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,399
You're amazing.

168
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Thank you.

169
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
But…

170
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,080
when did you become my creditor?

171
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:04,625
Huh?

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,519
Did you forget everything from before?

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
Please give me your bank number.

174
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,559
Once I find a job and save enough,

175
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,840
I'll pay you back the rent.

176
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Wen Nuannuan,

177
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,440
can you really repay
what you owe me?

178
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Forget it.

179
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,159
Consider it hush money.

180
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:27,639
What happened today…

181
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,279
don't tell anyone.

182
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,799
Got it.

183
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:37,733
Don't worry.

184
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,279
I won't tell anyone
what happened today.

185
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,600
And in the future, I won't...

186
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,719
I'll send you the location.

187
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,559
Okay.

188
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
See you soon.

189
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,919
What did you say?

190
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,679
I said…

191
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,720
I won't bother you in the future either.

192
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Bye.

193
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,679
You…

194
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,919
All grown up and you're
still crying like this?

195
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Isn't it embarrassing?

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Alright.

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Have some candy.

198
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
No more crying.

199
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,200
Xiao He,

200
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,080
let's go!

201
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,159
Coming!

202
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,879
Hurry up.

203
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,720
What's got you so happy?

204
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,280
Do you still remember
that person I told you about before?

205
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,039
Your…

206
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,080
never-started, already-over first love?

207
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:18,799
Don't tell me you…

208
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
Life, huh.

209
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Notify HR.

210
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,639
I need a new assistant.

211
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay.

212
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,399
Wen Nuannuan,

213
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,279
starting today,

214
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,519
your easy days are over.

215
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Xiao He,

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
it was so good to see you.

217
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,200
But we probably won't meet again.

218
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:10,541
[*searching up Lin Can*]

219
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,919
So pretty.

220
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,879
They say she has a big shot backing her.

221
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,135
Otherwise, she'd be finished.

222
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,039
Can Can's been quietly doing charity all along.

223
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,600
Can't the gossip get any fresher?

224
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,655
If you don't know the truth,

225
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,679
don't talk nonsense.

226
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,080
That limited edition motorcycle of hers

227
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,640
could last a regular person a lifetime.

228
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,960
You worker ants

229
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,655
shouldn't bother pitying celebrities making millions.

230
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,440
Lin Can and her agent Si Han…

231
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,559
I could ship that.

232
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,120
They look so good together.

233
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
But…

234
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,919
it's none of my business.

235
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,679
Star Entertainment.

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,399
Isn't that Xiao He's company?

237
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:01,360
No.

238
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
I can't go.

239
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,279
But next month's rent…

240
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,080
I wonder if I'll get hired this time.

241
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,919
But dear God,

242
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
please don't let me run into Lin Can.

243
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,259
[Auntie]

244
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Hello, Auntie.

245
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,519
Nuannuan, I have some good news.

246
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,720
Your cousin is getting married.

247
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Congratulations to him.

248
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,120
The girl's from the city.

249
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,159
The bride price is 300,000.

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,519
As the older sister,

251
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,816
you should contribute 88,000.

252
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Only fair, right?

253
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,720
Auntie,

254
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,279
it's not that I don't want to help,

255
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
but I really don't have that kind of money.

256
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,759
Besides, our cousin is so outstanding...

257
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,559
any girl would be lucky to have him.

258
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
Why would he need a bride price?

259
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,279
Don't give me that.

260
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,879
Have a conscience.

261
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
Since you were little,

262
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,679
how much have we spent on you?

263
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Auntie,

264
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,559
I really don't have time right now.

265
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,960
Let's talk another day.

266
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,600
I have to go to an interview.

267
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,759
If I don't do well in this interview,

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
not only can't I give you money,

269
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,480
I might have to rely on you.

270
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,679
Hello?

271
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Auntie?

272
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Auntie?

273
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,879
Did you see the recent hot searches?

274
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,879
I heard Lin Can's about to be canceled.

275
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
But even in this state,

276
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,240
I heard she still snatched Jiang Wan's lead role.

277
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,480
Exactly.

278
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
It's trending everywhere.

279
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,640
The tag “Lin Can Get Out of Entertainment”

280
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,720
has over a billion views.

281
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
And that gossip about her and her agent Si Han...

282
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
is it true or not?

283
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,599
Don't know.

284
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,480
But honestly, they do look good together.

285
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,559
You all know so much gossip.

286
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,799
Is it even real?

287
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,400
Who knows?

288
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,559
But that's what's online.

289
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,559
The way you talk,

290
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,319
I thought you saw it yourselves.

291
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,799
Wha— what's it to you?

292
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,200
We can say whatever we want.

293
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
None of your business.

294
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,240
It's not my business.

295
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,759
But I just think…

296
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,359
you don't need to worry so much.

297
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,319
After all, Lin Can isn't blind.

298
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
She…

299
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,599
would never pick any of you as assistants.

300
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,519
Right, little girl?

301
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,400
Lin Can.

302
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,999
She's even more beautiful in person.

303
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,160
Probably spent a fortune on that face.

304
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,319
Can't even take care of yourself.

305
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,040
How will you take care of me?

306
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,799
Just like a little puppy.

307
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,599
Lin Can!

308
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Stop right there!

309
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:26,960
Lin Can!

310
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,720
Why did you steal my lead role?

311
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,440
You've been my supporting actress for years.

312
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Still not used to it?

313
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,640
You're just jealous!

314
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,359
The director said

315
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
the female lead needs someone like me...

316
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,119
with a perfect waist-to-hip ratio.

317
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,559
Too bad.

318
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Great body, no brains.

319
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:47,799
You...

320
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,799
Jiang Wan.

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Si Han.

322
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:55,519
Take the next interviewee to the meeting room.

323
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,160
Today's interviews end here.

324
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,960
Other applicants

325
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
may leave.

326
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,079
Miss Jiang,

327
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
if you have any issues with the casting,

328
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
take it up with Mr. Shen.

329
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,720
As for now…

330
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,079
please mind where you are.

331
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Let's go.

332
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Lin Can,

333
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
don't get too cocky.

334
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,079
I hear the tax bureau

335
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,079
will be visiting soon.

336
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
Better memorize your
supporting actress lines.

337
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,920
Please enjoy the anger-relief exercise.

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Are you crazy?

339
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,559
Teacher Jiang Wan,

340
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,319
you instructed me before:

341
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,680
next time you get angry,

342
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,200
play this anger-relief exercise.

343
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,519
Don't be troubled, don't be troubled.

344
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,960
Trouble will make you die early.

345
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Lin Can!

346
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,400
I'll kill you!

347
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,599
Come in.

348
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,759
Hello, interviewers.

349
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,720
My name is Wen Nuannuan.

350
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,919
I'm here for the interview.

351
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,079
Have a seat.

352
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,039
This is my resume.

353
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,599
So your career plan is to be…

354
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
an instant noodle blogger,

355
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,200
or…

356
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,519
a moving company worker?

357
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,440
No, no, no.

358
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,759
I'm applying to be a celebrity assistant.

359
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,519
Any salary expectations?

360
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,559
Um…

361
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,359
Enough for rent is fine.

362
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,119
Please take another look.

363
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,519
Look at this...

364
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,480
this is my “Box Moving King” award

365
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,039
from the moving company.

366
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,240
And also…

367
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,839
my special guide for solo hunger situations...

368
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,879
Instant Noodle Strategies.

369
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,359
Air-fryer crispy noodles,

370
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,680
crayfish mixed noodles,

371
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
spicy sour noodles,

372
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,400
cold tossed noodles,

373
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,039
curry seafood noodles…

374
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,559
Sign here.

375
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,759
Stamp here.

376
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay.

377
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Alright.

378
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,160
Welcome.

379
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
You're hired.

380
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,000
It's…

381
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
that simple?

382
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,680
You…

383
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:24,079
Look...

384
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,079
I still have lots of skills to show.

385
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,640
Not needed.

386
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Starting today,

387
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,559
you are Teacher Lin Can's assistant.

388
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,519
Lin Can?

389
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,079
I really can't do this.

390
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:37,480
Come on.

391
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,039
I'm not cut out for this.

392
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,759
Let me show you around.

393
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
I really can't, miss.

394
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,200
Miss…

395
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I...

396
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,000
Miss, I really can't.

397
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,039
This is your supervisor's office.

398
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,720
This is the boss's office.

399
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Over here

400
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,599
is the company pantry.

401
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,480
Now let me tell you...

402
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,039
Can… can you find someone else?

403
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:54,920
I really can't be Lin Can's assistant.

404
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Trying to run?

405
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,079
Let me tell you,

406
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,160
the contract is signed.

407
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
No turning back.

408
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,960
I didn't know that was a contract.

409
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,119
No probation period.

410
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Direct full-time hire.

411
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,079
Full-time?

412
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,119
Salary's good too.

413
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
This much.

414
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,119
Five figures?

415
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,319
First things first...

416
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,599
you must address Lin
Can as “Teacher Lin Can.”

417
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,480
Next, listen carefully.

418
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,759
You need to remember these rules.

419
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
First,

420
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,160
Teacher Lin Can's assistant

421
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,759
must be available 24/7.

422
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,920
Second,

423
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,000
she treats her motorcycle better than her own mother.

424
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,000
The last assistant

425
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,839
got the maintenance date wrong

426
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,319
and was fired on the spot.

427
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
And also…

428
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,759
never, ever ask if she has someone she likes.

429
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,240
The assistant before the last one

430
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,160
asked about her relationship status

431
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,599
and later…

432
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,200
Wh-what happened to her?

433
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
I heard

434
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,599
after leaving,

435
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,240
she was mentally traumatized.

436
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,599
Needed six months of therapy.

437
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,799
She's probably recovered by now.

438
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,160
Wen Nuannuan,

439
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,319
good luck.

440
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,319
And the rumors about you and your agent Si Han...

441
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,720
the lesbian gossip is everywhere.

442
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,599
Is it true or not?

443
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,160
Lin Can!

444
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,879
Why did you steal my lead role?

445
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,160
Nuannuan,

446
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,480
all settled with onboarding?

447
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,039
I've signed away my body.

448
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Good.

449
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,640
Your first day starts with work.

450
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Sorry about that.

451
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,440
But Lin Can is missing right now.

452
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,759
I have an important meeting soon.

453
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,079
It's urgent.

454
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,000
I need you to help me immediately

455
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
to find Lin Can as soon as possible.

456
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,519
Okay.

457
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,480
I'll text you her location.

458
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Contact me if anything.

459
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,599
Good luck,

460
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Wen Nuannuan.

461
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Teacher Lin Can.

462
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,839
Teacher Lin Can.

463
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Teacher Lin Can.

464
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Teacher Lin Can.

465
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm coming in.

466
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,559
Teacher Lin Can.

467
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,119
Must be home by 3 a.m.

468
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,759
Watch your mouth in front of the media.

469
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,799
No posting sad essays after drinking.

470
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,880
Going faster than eighty...

471
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,400
no alcohol for a week.

472
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,519
Teacher Lin Can.

473
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Are you in there?

474
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I'm coming in.

475
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,839
Xiao He.

476
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,599
Teacher Lin Can.

477
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Teacher Lin Can.

478
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,839
Xiao He.

479
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,319
What's wrong?

480
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,480
Oh no.

481
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Is she… dead?

482
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,559
No.

483
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,960
I need to call 911.

484
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,599
So-sorry, Teacher Lin Can.

485
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
I didn't mean it.

486
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I thought you were…

487
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,079
After disappearing for so long,

488
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
you're finally back.

489
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,400
If I died,

490
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
would you be sad?

491
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Yes.

492
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,039
I don't want to lose my job on day one.

493
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So…

494
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,456
you don't want anything to happen to me.

495
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Of course.

496
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,039
I mean…

497
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,119
I don't want to be

498
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,359
the primary suspect.

499
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,960
So you still care about me, right?

500
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,000
What's with Lin Can today?

501
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,039
Um… Teacher Lin Can,

502
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,599
It was Si Han who sent me.

503
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,160
I'm your new assistant.

504
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:04,186
Wen Nuannuan.

505
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Have you figured out how you're
going to repay what you owe me?

506
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,039
What do I do?

507
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,160
Did she plan how to torture me?

508
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Don't go.

509
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Don't leave me.

510
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
(Easter egg)

511
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,640
Let's go, hurry.

512
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,720
Hurry, it's about to rain.
