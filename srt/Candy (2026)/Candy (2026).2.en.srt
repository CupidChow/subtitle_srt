1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,319
Sihan, you probably don't remember this,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,240
but before you became a big star at New Entertainment,

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:07,799
we
had already met.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,440
She's so beautiful.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,280
Jiang Wan, you're up.

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,000
Be careful.

7
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,079
Thanks.

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
"Candy"
(Special Episode)

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,880
This book really made me cry so hard.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
No, no…

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,840
I need to control my emotions.

12
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,200
Don't take screenshots, okay?

13
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:09,684
[She's switching to another account to creep]

14
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:18,785
[Si Han's account]

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,159
Does she go live every night?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,200
It feels like

17
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,400
I can get a little closer to her life.

18
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,079
Have you heard?

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,719
Si Han is about to do a GL drama.

20
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,840
I heard there's a lot of intimate scenes.

21
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,839
Just thinking about it feels exciting.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,800
She's going to film intimate scenes with someone else…

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,599
If only

24
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,639
I had joined the company three months earlier,

25
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,840
would that opportunity have been mine?

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
What's wrong with her?

27
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,334
[She requested to add Si Han, Si Han accepted, no other messages yet]

28
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,370
(You went to Wudang Mountain?
Was it beautiful there...?)

29
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,504
(It's cold on the mountain, you're wearing too little...)

30
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,520
Teacher Si Han,

31
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,759
I saw the video you posted from Wudang Mountain.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,520
Really looking forward to your new drama "Candy".

33
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Wishing you all the best.

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,120
Too deliberate… too formal…

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,120
Will she think I'm weird?

36
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,960
Whatever, forget it.

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,163
(Thanks)

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
Why does she seem off lately?

39
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,960
Did something happen to her?

40
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,919
Been pretty bored lately,

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,480
so just thought I'd chat with you all.

42
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,120
Yeah, it's raining on the mountain,

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,319
so
I'm in the hotel right now.

44
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,520
Everything's fine,

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,360
just a bit cold up here,

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,520
and it's been raining nonstop.

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
So,

48
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,280
the blankets feel a little damp.

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,759
She's clearly exhausted,

50
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,959
but still smiling for the camera,

51
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,000
still answering everyone's questions.

52
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,040
"Silence doesn't mean I'm wrong…"

53
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,040
Thank you, Nocturne, for the little hearts.

54
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,800
Your ID looks familiar—

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
seems like you're here every time I stream.

56
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,199
Thanks for your support.

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
Wudang Mountain is pretty humid,

58
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,119
try soaking your feet at night,

59
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,720
add some ginger slices,

60
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,399
helps with the dampness.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,079
Thank you.

62
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,240
Thanks for the sweet suggestion.

63
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,480
I'll try it tonight.

64
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,040
Soaking feet with ginger…

65
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,199
sounds really cozy.

66
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

67
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Thanks for keeping me company tonight.

68
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,040
Honestly, lately…

69
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,680
I've been a little tired,

70
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
and also a bit

71
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,319
lost.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,480
But seeing your comments,

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
feeling your care,

74
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,439
I feel motivated again.

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,680
Okay,

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
thank you, everyone.

77
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,720
Thanks for

78
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,759
watching today.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,199
See you next time.

80
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,519
Bye.

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Goodbye.

82
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,920
At least…

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,519
she'll probably sleep better tonight.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,920
Soaking feet with ginger…

85
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,360
That was a thoughtful suggestion.

86
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,160
Who is this "Nocturne," I wonder?

87
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,439
Due to her personal reasons,

88
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,159
the company had no choice but to make this decision.

89
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,560
We'll have to use AI face replacement.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
It's the only way.

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,879
But AI can't handle intimate scenes.

92
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,480
Those need to be reshot.

93
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,519
Intimacy requires chemistry.

94
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,360
If you're going to reshoot those parts,

95
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,160
I need someone who can understand the emotions

96
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
and can get into character immediately.

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,040
Teacher Si Han.

98
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,199
If you're here to comfort me,

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
don't bother.

100
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
I've heard enough today.

101
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
I'm not here to comfort you.

102
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,040
I've watched every public clip of you and her from "Candy."

103
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,519
From the campus to the workplace scenes,

104
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
I've studied them all.

105
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,319
I've analyzed your acting clips.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,319
When your emotions fluctuate,

107
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,319
your left eyebrow rises 0.3 cm higher than your right.

108
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,279
When you're gathering your emotions,

109
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,720
you press your lips together.

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
And…

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,519
when you film kiss scenes,

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
your ears turn red.

113
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,399
I've studied all of this.

114
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,519
You…

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,079
I want to be there for you.

116
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,079
To catch every look,

117
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,480
every emotion,

118
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,399
every piece of sincerity hidden behind the camera.

119
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
From now on,

120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,079
just call me Si Han.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
I finally said it.

122
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't want to be anyone,

123
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,920
or replace anyone.

124
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,560
I just really want to be

125
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,040
someone who can support her.

126
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,040
Right now, we're

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,519
working on face fusion.

128
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,920
Basically, we're merging

129
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,240
the original actress's footage with

130
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
the new actress's face.

131
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,799
Currently,

132
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,079
we're fine-tuning micro-expressions,

133
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,279
lip-syncing,

134
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,480
and subtle movements.

135
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,639
It's taking a while.

136
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,495
It's been quite time-consuming—

137
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,080
already a couple of days.

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,720
But AI is still AI after all.

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,320
Genuine human emotion can't be replaced by AI.

140
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,799
To be honest,

141
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,960
when Jiang Wan first volunteered,

142
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
I had my doubts.

143
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,600
Actors usually need

144
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,120
time to build chemistry.

145
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,039
But during Jiang Wan and Si Han's first rehearsal,

146
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
I knew it was going to work.

147
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,519
The way Jiang Wan looked at Si Han…

148
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,200
that wasn't acting.

149
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,734
If you could lift it up

150
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,759
and have her pull it off, that'd be best.

151
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,200
You two work it out.

152
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,279
I'll leave this to you both.

153
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,639
There's not much I can do.

154
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,720
After you say your line, there's another thing—

155
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
Can we hug and sleep together tonight?

156
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,240
After it's off,

157
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,279
you two start kissing passionately,

158
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,240
really intense,

159
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,679
then your hand goes to her neck,

160
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,360
sexily pulling her strap down.

161
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,840
Then you can kiss down her neck,

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,399
here, keep going down.

163
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,600
No need to reach over with both hands—

164
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,919
you've already pulled her close.

165
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,720
Just lift it straight up.

166
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,279
Jiang Wan.

167
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,559
Thank you.

168
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,039
I'm really glad I came.

169
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,919
This time,

170
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,559
I'm not just watching her shine from afar.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,080
This time,

172
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm in her story.

173
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,840
Not as a replacement,

174
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,559
not as a face double.

175
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,879
I'm Jiang Wan—

176
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,720
someone who can stand beside her on camera,

177
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,120
catch her tears,

178
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,080
and hold her close.

179
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,738
(Some regrets can never be
mended, but some encounters happen

180
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:13,000
precisely so that regret doesn't
become the final chapter.)

181
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,279
Good morning.

182
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,039
We're at the beach.

183
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,759
It's 7:30 a.m.

184
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,559
The sea…

185
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,039
We're right in front of the ocean.

186
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,559
Now,

187
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,679
flipp the camera…

188
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,799
so blue.

189
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,159
Let me show you.

190
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,799
Can you see it?

191
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,240
Switching back.

192
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Here, you hold it.

193
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,639
What do you want to eat?

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,360
I'd like to have a big meat bun.

195
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,879
You come to the beach and want a meat bun?

196
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,039
Fine, let's get some seafood.

197
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,000
How about sea cucumber fried rice?

00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,039
Sea cucumber fried rice,

201
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,399
Let's go then.

202
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,759
Go!

203
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Finished it again.
