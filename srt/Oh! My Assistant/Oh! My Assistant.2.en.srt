I brought my own computer. I'm used to using it.

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,780
I can use mine, right?

00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,240
Of course.

- That's okay.

- I already had some.

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,670
I already washed it. You can wear it right away.

Is he talking about me by chance?

155

Hold on.

Min Yeong? It could be Min Yeong!

160

Is it Mu Yeong or Min Yeong?

161
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,140
Hold on. It can't be me.

There's no way.

Wake up, Ko Mu Yeong!

164

167
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,100
Mu Yeong!

168
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,790
Get up, Mr. Shin!

169
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,300
I'm sorry!

170
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,130
Get up quickly. It's time for me to go home.

171
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,140
Already?

172
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,650
You should've woken me up earlier.

173
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,980
I did, but you didn't wake up.

174
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,430
Anyway, I'm going home now.

175
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,830
Okay, bye.

176
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,790
I'll sleep more.

177
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,550
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,960
I'm on my way home.

179
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,640
Really?

180
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,820
What are you doing?

181
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,890
I'm nearby. Should we have dinner together?

182
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,320
Okay, come to my place.

183
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay. I'll be right there.

184
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,680
Okay.

185
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,300
You're leaving? Right now?

186
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,910
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,570
You planned to go see a musical with me!

188
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,090
What can I do?

189
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,670
It looks like he's troubled.

190
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you care more about your friend than your girlfriend?

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,460
You know.

192
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm Mu Yeong's only friend.

193
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,490
Hey. You have something on your mind, don't you?

195
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,790
I do? What are you talking about?

196
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,060
Not at all.

197
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,560
I don't think so. I think you do.

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,160
I know just by looking at your face.

199
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,580
Don't waste your time and just tell me.

200
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,240
You'll end up telling me everything anyway.

201
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,600
Why are you so hesitant to say it?

202
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,770
Is it serious? Are you terminally ill or something?

203
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,400
"Mu Yeong..."

204
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,180
What?

205
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,040
Geez.

206
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,870
"Mu Yeong..."

207
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,040
What does that sound like to you?

208
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,350
"Muy..."

209
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,310
Do you understand that?

210
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,330
It's a person's name. But it trailed off at the end.

211
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,100
Does it sound like Mu Yeong or Min Yeong?

212
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,930
Did that artist say that?

213
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,060
Why are you laughing?

214
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,870
I'm asking if that artist guy said that.

215
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
Who's Min Yeong, then?

217
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,010
It's his producer.

218
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,940
He should have pronounced it correctly if he was going to say it.

219
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,750
Why did he have to trail off at the end like that?

220
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,070
He was sleep-talking.

221
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,880
Sleep-talking?

222
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,440
Sleep-talking?

223
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,770
Did you sleep with him already?

224
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,240
Geez, we don't have that kind of relationship!

225
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,750
If so, you don't have to worry if it was.

226
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,500
Min Yeong or Mu Yeong.

227
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,220
That's...

228
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,350
You definitely are into him.

229
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,780
But nothing changes.

230
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,090
He's straight.

231
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,070
You don't know if he's straight or bisexual.

232
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,470
Who knows? He might be bisexual without even realizing it.

233
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,740
Also...

234
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,540
you never know about people's feelings.

235
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,260
Once you fall for someone,

236
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,730
your true feelings come out without realizing it.

237
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,080
You totally slept with him.

238
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,160
Mu Yeong...

239
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,360
It's cold.

240
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,040
It is.

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,510
You really don't want to go get a drink?

242
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,680
No.

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
I don't even feel like it.

244
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,210
I have a bit of a headache, too.

245
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,710
You have a headache?

246
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,780
Do you have a fever? Let me see.

247
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,350
It's not like that.

248
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,090
I'm okay.

249
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,310
You should get going.

250
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,700
You must be tired.

251
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,160
Okay.

252
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,270
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

253
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,500
You should've woken me up before you left.

254
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm dying right now because I have so many sequences left to draw.

255
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,920
[Artist Shin Seon Ho: You should have woken me up before you left.]

256
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,830
[I'm dying right now because I have so many sequences left to draw.]

257
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:21,600
♫ Make me smile even more today ♫

258
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,750
♫ Each day becomes more beautiful ♫

259
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,670
♫ Makes me curious what you're thinking ♫

260
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,290
♫ In my own head... ♫
