You know what?

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,270
When you finish late,

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,820
the producers have to go home late, too.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,730
But some producers probably have kids, right?

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,140
Then the teachers at the daycare would go home late, too. Right?

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,920
At that rate, everyone in the world would be working late.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,290
That's great.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,930
Isn't it?

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,300
Yes...

It must be hard for him to do it alone.

16
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,240
Maybe I should have stayed and helped him.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600

And you blamed me for barging in.

What would you do if you missed the deadline at this rate?

22

I'm sorry, PD.

It would have been nice if you had the assistant around at times like this.

Did he go home already?

26
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,810
According to the contract, he's only supposed to work until 6:00 p.m.

27

Don't worry and go home.

28

I'll make sure to send you the material before midnight.

You won't make me come here again, right?

Of course not.

32

I'll trust you and leave then.

- I'm going home!
- Trust me. Yes.

- Mu Yeong.
- Well...

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,500
I thought it'd be too much for you to finish the work alone.

So I wanted to help you...

Of course, I'll come in late tomorrow

Well done, Mu Yeong.

Should we take a break since we took care of the urgent stuff?

58
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,830
By the way, Mr. Shin.

59
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,300
Don't you feel a bit chilly?

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,190
Is it because it's early morning?

61
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,260
Should I turn up the boiler?

62
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,360
The boiler is... broken.

63
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,530
I forgot to fix it.

64
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,840
Should we turn the heater on, then?

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,960
I think I... I do have a heater, but...

66
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,080
I had one, but it's gone now.

67

It's okay.

69

It's okay.

71

Would you like a drink, then?

72
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,300
I think it would warm you up a bit.

73
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,690
Okay then.

74
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,260

Min Yeong gave it to me as a present.

I've been saving it because

83
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,840
I didn't know how to drink it.

I'll take some more.

You won't be able to work if you drink too much.

94

By the way, why do you work as an assistant?

95
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,780
Considering your talent, you could debut right away.

96
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,730
I wanted to become a comic artist when I was a student.

97
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,240
But imagining how a character moves,

98
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,880
and how the next scene unfolds

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,430
was pretty difficult.

100
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,920
I started drawing...

101
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,340
because I was copying someone I liked.

102
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't you have a girlfriend, Mu Yeong?

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,570
No. How about you?

104
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,610
I... have been single for three years.

105
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,100
I see.

106
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,260
I guess he wasn't dating Min Yeong.

107
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,770
Although I'm not certain if it's a fling or not.

108
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,530
Three years ago,

109
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,440
I met my first love.

110
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,180
She demanded a lot of things from me.

111
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,930
"Why do you make comics? Why don't you have a car?"

112
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,520
I had no money, car, house, or vision.

113
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,050
What a foolish person she must have been.

114
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,180
Don't you want to have a girlfriend?

115
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,980
It's too much of a hassle for me.

116
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,950
Having to spend energy to maintain a relationship

117
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,340
is not appealing to me.

118
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,650
But it would be different if it were with you.

119
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,170
I guess it can be like that.

120
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,430
But don't you get more energy out of it?

121
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,280
I think I just... like the warmth you get when you're together.

122
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,040
I think that's a nice feeling on its own.

123
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,840
If it were me,

124
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,930
I would have held on and never let you go.

125
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,770
Shall we drink, then?

126
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,700
Hold on.

127
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,440
What am I thinking about?

128
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,600
Know your place, Ko Mu Yeong.

129
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,740
This drink makes me feel warm, too.

130
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,980
Mu Yeong.

131
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,440
I have a favor to ask.

132
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,150
- I'll say no.
- Don't be like that.

133
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,130
- Don't ask me anything.
- Just this once, please?

134
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,330
Please?

135
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,380
What is it anyway?

136
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,770
You can't change the contract condition.

137
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,590
I'd like to...

138
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,120
try drawing you.

139
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,190
To be exact,

140
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,730
I'd like to draw your topless body.

141
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,720
Pardon? Nude?

142
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,590
Gosh, don't get any funny ideas.

143
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,420
It's because I'm an artist.

144
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,720
What is he saying?

145
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,970
I didn't have a lot of chances to do figure drawings.

146
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,790
Before I started the series,

147
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,000
I used to be in a nude figure drawing club, too.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,220
I hate showing my naked body to other people.

149
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,130
- Just this once, please?
- I don't want to.

150
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,420
You'd be topless, not totally naked.

151
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,710
You saw my body earlier today, too.

152
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,910
You're coming at me without warning like this?

153
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,140
I didn't see that because I wanted to.

154
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,700
Be fair and just show me.

155
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,970
Mr. Shin, are you drunk?

156
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,210
Yes. I am drunk.

157
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,440
- I don't want to!
- Please.

158
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,620
Please?

159
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,450
How did this happen?

160
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,400
Ko Mu Yeong, why couldn't you say no?

161
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,960
I'll just do one pose.

162
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,340
Just for a minute.

163
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,090
So you should draw quickly.

164
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,540
Okay.

165
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,200
How long will you be drawing for?

166
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,270
It's been almost a minute.

167
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,970
I'll draw just a few more.

168
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,970
I'd like to draw from different angles.

169
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,010
Aren't you working too hard?

170
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,560
What's so fun about drawing a man's body?

171
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,400
You probably don't know this,

172
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,530
but your facial expression is interesting.

173
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,200
It looks like you don't care,

174
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,790
but you seem full of affection,

175
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
and you're sexy.

176
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,400
Who initiated it?

177
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,480
I don't know what happened all of a sudden.

178
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,280
I didn't plan this from the beginning.

179
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,490
I tried to hold back, but...

180
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,540
How much did I drink?

181
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,400
Geez!

182
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,350
Gosh.

183
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,760
Did I drink too much last night?

184
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,810
What?

185
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,590
What's this?

186
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,580
I didn't kiss. I didn't!

187
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,340
Probably not.

188
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,110
It wasn't a kiss.

189
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,700
It wasn't.

190
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,560
Do I like men, too?

191
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,830
I've never thought about that before.

192
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,370
Hold on.

193
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,580
"You're sexy."

194
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,950
I must be crazy!

195
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,770
Did I really say that?

196
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,570
My phone!

197
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,990
What should I do?

198
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,400
Hold on.

199
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,160
Should I call or not?

200
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,630
How could I face him now?

201
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,520
I kissed Mr. Shin...

202
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
But I feel crappy.

203
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,200
♫ I'm so happy that it's you ♫

204
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,390
♫ Because you're someone who'll see me as I am ♫

205
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,980
♫ I'm so happy that it's you ♫

206
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,320
♫ My heart is fluttering ♫

207
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,560
♫ Our nights are exciting ♫

208
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,090
♫ That's how we are ♫

209
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:51,450
♫ One day, I was thinking about you out of the blue ♫
