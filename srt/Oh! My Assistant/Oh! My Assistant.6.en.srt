It was uncharacteristically childish of me.

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,490
But seeing Mu Yeong being tempted

8
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,980
made me angry, and I couldn't help it.

9

I guess Mu Yeong has always been like that.

Anyway, when I kissed you,

What should I do?

49

It's awkward. I feel like I had a crush on someone with a girlfriend─

No, I feel like I had a crush on a man who had a boyfriend.

168
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,960
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,030
Bye!

170
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,640
♫ I'm curious what your day is like ♫

171
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,970
♫ I try imagining it ♫

172
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,530
Mu Yeong, can we talk for a second?

173
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,190
I'm sorry about quitting the job.

174
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,840
What did you want to tell me?

175
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,820
I'm in a hurry.

176
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,040
I tried to tell him to stay with me

177
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,260
and to stay by my side because I can wait.

178
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,800
But I just realized...

179
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,320
that I tried to do something to Mu Yeong that I'd regret so much later.

180
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,070
Thank you... for everything.

181
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,610
♫ The time I lost ♫

182
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,130
We weren't even in a relationship.

183
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,540
Why does it hurt so much?

184
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,080
♫ I wonder if it was ♫

185
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,610
♫ I let go of everything ♫

186
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,360
Mu Yeong.

187
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,110
I miss you.

188
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,700
♫ I can't help myself ♫

189
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,530
♫ Thinking of you all day ♫

190
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,060
I miss you.

191
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,570
♫ It's so hard for me ♫

192
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,340
♫ But you don't seem to be struggling ♫

193
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,610
♫ How could we break up? ♫

194
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,480
♫ I can't even see you ♫

195
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,800
♫ Meeting you and seeing you off was my routine ♫

196
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,310
♫ I'm standing in front of your house because of that habit ♫
