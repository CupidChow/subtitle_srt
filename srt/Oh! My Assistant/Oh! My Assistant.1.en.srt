00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,540
As I struggled to make a unique work in the competitive webtoon field,

9
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,570
I ended up on this path without realizing it.

- But...
- Hey, Seon Ho!
- Yes?

11
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,820
Hey, if you draw X-rated comics,

12
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,190
don't you have dirty thoughts whenever you work?

13

Gosh, it might be too tiring if that happens every time you work.

No!

15

In my opinion, since he sees it every day,

16
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,390
he might actually be broken.

Working overtime for deadlines isn't optional, but it's mandatory.

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,680
Pardon?

161
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,440
You're hired! Please be my assistant.

162
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,080
I thought I'd make it,

163
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,280
but I didn't think you'd tell me right away.

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,480
Please start coming in tomorrow, then.

165
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes, I will.

166
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,040
Yes!

167
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,540
Anyway, what was that?

168
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,100
It wasn't broken?

169
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,510
Why all of a sudden...

170
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,820
What's with that shirt?

171
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,590
You didn't go to the interview like that, right?

172
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,900
It's a long story.

173
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,330
- I'll have what he's having.
- Yes.

174
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,630
You seem to be in a good mood.

175
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,140
What was he like in person?

176
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,890
You've liked that artist for a long time.

177
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,610
Is he your type?

178
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,250
What?

179
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,340
I guess he is.

180
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,950
Should I keep guessing, then?

181
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,090
He has curly and shaggy hair.

182
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,920
He has a silly smile.

183
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,470
He's an innocent puppy type.

184
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,160
This... won't suit you, would it?

185
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,080
I was right.

186
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,160
Ko Mu Yeong, your type has always been so consistent.

187
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,190
- Your first love was─
- That's enough, Han Joon Seok.

188
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,120
Anyway, good luck. You never know.

189
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,210
There's no chance. He's straight.

190
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,600
He draws X-rated comics.

191
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,250
There's no way a straight man would like me.

192
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
Excuse me. Looks like you're here together.

193
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,020
I'd like to get you drinks if you don't mind.

194
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,670
The one with the glasses is so handsome.

195
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,130
I'm okay.

196
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,230
Okay!

197
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,510
Hey.

198
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,560
He winked when he said, "Okay."

199
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,170
So why do you keep suggesting drinking here?

200
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,610
Because it's easy to meet someone here.

201
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,740
And I get to chat with you, too.

202
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,090
I get to kill two birds with one stone.

203
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,000
Only you get to kill two birds.

204
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,030
Where are you going?

205
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,790
To the restroom.

206
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,940
Excuse me.

207
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,580
He's straight, Mu Yeong.

208
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,530
Get it together.

209
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,600
♫ I'm so happy that it's you ♫

210
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,810
♫ Because you're someone who'll see me as I am ♫

211
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,480
♫ I really like you ♫

212
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,740
♫ My heart is fluttering ♫

213
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,180
♫ Our nights are exciting ♫

214
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,510
♫ That's how we are ♫

215
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,890
♫ One day, I was thinking about you out of the blue ♫

216
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,640
♫ And I suddenly had a thought ♫

217
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:18,100
♫ I hope we get to walk holding hands together someday ♫
