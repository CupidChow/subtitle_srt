4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,870
Since I was a kid, choosing which school to attend,

Mr. Shin, I was going to keep this letter to myself.

170
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,610
But one day, after some time had passed,

171
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,310
I got to meet you again.

172
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,390
My suppressed feelings

173
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,670
started bursting out again.

174
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,870
I couldn't take it anymore.

175
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,300
I want to be selfish now.

176
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,080
Because I like you so much.

177
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:04,660
♫ I'll be gone, I'll never come back again ♫

178
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,630
♫ I think of you all day ♫

179
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,000
♫ It's so hard for me to even breathe ♫

180
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,080
♫ But you don't seem to be struggling ♫

181
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,790
If you hide it...

182
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,650
like a fool, how am I supposed to know?

183
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,490
♫ I'm so happy it's you ♫

184
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,230
- Mr. Shin, I thought you were angry.
- I am.

185
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,810
I really wasn't going to see you.

186
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,190
If it weren't for this letter,

187
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
I wouldn't have come.

188
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,160
I finally let you know how I feel.

189
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,130
Why didn't you tell me all this time?

190
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,120
You should have just told me, then.

191
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,390
Why didn't you do anything?

192
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,130
At the time, I didn't have the courage.

193
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,690
It's too late, isn't it?

194
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,150
It's not too late.

195
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,020
Thank you for being brave.

196
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,870
♫ Among so many people ♫

197
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,370
♫ I collect memories with you ♫

198
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,120
♫ I cherish you ♫

199
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,480
♫ I think of your warm smile ♫

200
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,100
♫ I'm so happy it's you ♫

201
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:45,300
♫ Because you accepted me as I am ♫

202
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,250
♫ I'm so happy it's you, my heart is beating ♫

203
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,890
By the way, that person...

204
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,110
What?

205
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,750
You know, him.

206
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,250
Joon Seok?

207
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,900
Don't say his name so affectionately.

208
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,830
That person. That person.

209
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,840
Okay. That person.

210
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,740
What about him?

211
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,160
Well... since you told him we were dating,

212
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,900
he calls you whenever you're with me.

213
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,100
Is he really just a friend?

214
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,200
He's a friend.

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
That's what you think.

216
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,510
Doesn't he have feelings for you?

217
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,910
♫ You cared for me ♫

218
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,350
What is it?

219
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,380
There's something going on, right?

220
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,540
Just be honest!

221
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,350
The thing is... He actually confessed his love to me.

222
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,750
And I said no.

223
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,620
See? I knew it.

224
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,200
Just wait and see, Han Joon Seok.

225
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,710
No. That person!

226
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,900
Mr. Shin, it makes me happy to see you get mad.

227
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,440
Geez!

228
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,650
You don't realize how serious this is!

229
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,520
I told you, I said no.

230
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,280
Don't you trust me?

231
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,790
No. I do trust you. I trust you!

232
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,420
But how am I supposed to trust him?

233
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,300
Why worry?

234
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,570
You're the only one for me.

235
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,430
You mean it, right?

236
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,030
Right?

237
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,500
Yes!

238
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,010
Are you that happy?

239
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,980
Yes, of course, I am.

240
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,190
Right, Mu Yeong.

241
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,490
- Should we live together?
- Yes.

242
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,070
What?

243
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,500
You agreed to live with me, okay?

244
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,540
I'll think about it if you can meet my conditions.

245
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,050
Let's hear them.

246
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,680
I'll meet all of them.

247
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,650

248
