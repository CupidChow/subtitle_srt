89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,690

90
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,380
And your parents, too.

91
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,570
Wouldn't your position at work be in danger, too─

92

93
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,080

No, but more importantly, PD Min Yeong is here─

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,330
I thought you might be angry because I kissed you suddenly.

98
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,220
I'll just dry off quickly and come out.

99

I'm sorry for touching your waist, too.

102
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,530
I touched your body without realizing it.

103
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,130
I got so sweaty.

104
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,320
You got covered in my sweat because of me.

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,130
Congratulations.

106
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,570
You're still there, right?

107

It's okay.

111

Love comes first.

112
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,500
I'll request a hiatus.

113

114

Of course, they were...

121
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,830
I'll explain it well to her,

122

You quit this job because of me. Right?

129
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,990
No.

130
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,200
It's my fault.

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,240
You don't have to lie to me.

132

No, it's really my fault!

133

By "acting foolish,"

136
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,280
you mean drawing comics?

137

No.

138
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,990

140

141
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,070
You like what?

142
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,960
Just pretend you didn't hear me.

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,180
Please...

144
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,030
Please say it again.

145
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,420
I'm going to quit acting foolish.

146
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,980
Not that.

147
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,510
You said you like me.

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,880
I wanted to hear those words.

149
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,180
Don't quit.

150
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,730
- Being your assistant?
- No.

151
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,820
Liking me.

152
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,230
Please keep liking me.

153
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,040
As long as you like me,

154
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,420
I'll stop worrying about other complicated stuff.

155
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,640
I know it's not my place to say this,

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,850
but break up with him.

157
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,260
Excuse me?

158
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,510
I like Mu Yeong?

159
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,740
You should see the person you like.

160
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,950
You want me to see the person I like?

161
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,110
Honestly, you meet Mu Yeong often

162
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,970
and you always run to him when he calls you.

163
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,410
Is that so?

164
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,600
I don't remember.

165
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,410
Anyway, what I'm saying is

166
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,090
- you should be with the one you really like.
- I said it's not like that.

167
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,890
- If not, do you have a crush on him or something?
- How dare you.

168
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,100
That's enough.

169
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,730
You really like him, don't you?

170
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,530
You never showed me your honest face like that.

171
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,420
I just took care of my naive friend

172
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,130
so he doesn't get hurt.

173
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm by his side when he needs me.

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,800
I have fun when I'm with him...

175
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,340
and happy.

176
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,180
I guess I do... like him.

177
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,820
- I like you.
- I like you.

178
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,500
So, please...

179
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,920
please like me only.

180
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,720
Can't you... break up with him?

181
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,910
Why don't you end your relationship first?

182
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,060
What do you mean?

183
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,730
PD Min Yeong.

184
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,520
I know you have a special relationship with her─

185
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,240
I do?

186
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,930
Aren't you...

187
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,460
- two dating?
- No.

188
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,900
There's no way.

189
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,740
Do you just sleep together, then?

190
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,160
What...

191
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
Who do you think I am?

192
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,060
But you went to a hotel together

193
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,310
and you held hands at the café, too.

194
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,330
We were there to do photo research.

195
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,560
And I gave her my hands to learn how to make a knot.

196
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,710
So you two...

197
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,180
Of course, we're nothing.

198
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,870
I see.

199
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,210
So... you guys are breaking up now. Right?

200
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,250
To be honest...

201
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,460
we pretended to be a couple.

202
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,680
He's a friend of mine.

203
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,160
What did you say?

204
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,990
I was so hurt because of that.

205
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,570
Why did you do that?

206
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,500
It's because I thought you kissed me

207
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,330
while you were dating PD Min Yeong.

208
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,850
Out of anger...

209
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,080
How could you do that?

210
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,640
Do you know how I felt?

211
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm...

212
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,950
really happy right now.

213
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,420
I like you, Mu Yeong.

214
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,000
Me, too, Mr. Shin.

215
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,130
By the way,

216
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,980
how did you know we went to a hotel and held hands?

217
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,960
Well, the thing is...

218
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,900
Excuse me.

219
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,550
- Yes.
- This is Ko Mu Yeong, right?

220
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,610
Oppa Joon Seok got into an accident.

221
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,350
- He's at a hospital right now.
- What?

222
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,810
Would you be able to come here?

223
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,730
Yes.

224
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,840
Mr. Shin, I think I should get going now.

225
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,030
Where?

226
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,050
Joon Seok got into an accident.

227
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,070
Let's talk later, then.

228
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,310
Wait, Mu Yeong...

229
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,800
What timing.

230
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,550
You're Ko Mu Yeong, right?

231
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,330
Yoon Ah?

232
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,020
What happened?

233
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,360
He got into an accident on his way home.

234
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,330
Thankfully, he wasn't seriously injured.

235
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,180
He just got a cast, and that was it.

236
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,120
But you know...

237
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,400
could you be by his side...

238
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,000
until he recovers?

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,230
Pardon?

240
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,720
We broke up.

241
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,690
- What─
- I actually know your relationship.

242
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,790
- I think you're mistaken─
- You might be treating it lightly,

243
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,490
but Oppa isn't.

244
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,280
He really likes you.

245
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,130
Thank you in advance.

246
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,330
♫ I wonder if it was ♫

247
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,190
♫ After letting go of everything ♫

248
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,050
♫ I think about it again ♫

249
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,600
♫ But I can't help myself ♫

250
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,100
♫ Thinking of you all day ♫

251
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,980
♫ It's so hard for me ♫

252
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,290
Are you okay?

253
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,680
Yes.

254
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,270
♫ But you don't seem to be ♫

255
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,890
When I fully recover,

256
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm thinking of just being in a foolish relationship.

257
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,540
♫ I can't even do it ♫

258
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,610
Aren't you curious?

259
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,360
What?

260
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,470
Aren't you curious...

261
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,480
about my foolish relationship?

262
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,890
♫ Because of that habit ♫

263
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,480
♫ Before we run into each other ♫

264
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,950
♫ I'll be gone, I'll never come back again ♫

265
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,200
♫ All day, I think of... ♫
