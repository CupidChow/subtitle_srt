00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,990
Mr. Shin fell asleep right away after what happened last night.

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,540
But when I saw Min Yeong's makeup pouch,

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,170
I suddenly had a wake-up call.

4
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,440
She was definitely there before I came

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,310
and Mr. Shin took a shower.

6
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,800
And he kissed me.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,320
But that kiss was...

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,170
so sweet.

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,610
I had no choice but to leave as though I was running away.

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,640
I keep feeling crappy.

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,670
Hello?

18
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,110
- Mu Yeong.
- Mr. Shin.

19
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm thinking of taking a day off since I don't feel so good.

20
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,320
- Would that be okay?
- Well, yes.

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,040
That's okay.

Well, yes.

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,170
- Well, then...
- Hello?

28
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,420
Mu Yeong. Mu Yeong!

29
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Shin has PD Min Yeong.

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,570
This is painful.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,460
Why is he so indifferent?

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,120
Am I old-fashioned?

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,130
I mean, does Mu Yeong think nothing of this?

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,460
Geez, I was the only one anxious,

36
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,030
But still, I'm glad he wasn't offended.

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,330
Well, what am I talking about right now?

38
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,300
I remember the texture.

39
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,320
Could I continue to work with him

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,330
as if nothing happened?

41
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,300
- Mr. Shin!
- Yes?

42
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,360
I want you to look at the rough sketches I did.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,010
Do they look okay to you?

44
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,240
Well, yes!

45
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,690
How's kimchi stew for lunch?

46
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,700
Kimchi stew sounds good.

47
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,610
Are we adding kimchi to ramen?

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,360
I'll cook for you today.

49

Wake up! Wake up!

50
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,780
Be careful with this.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,440
Is Mu Yeong really indifferent about what happened?

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,050
Am I the only one who's concerned?

53

I'll get going, then.

Wait, Mu Yeong.

55
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,450
Would you like to have dinner together?

56
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,090
- I'll order fried chicken─
- No.

57
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,290
- I have plans.
- Well, okay.

58
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,490
See you then!

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,890
Are you...

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,900
really indifferent, Mu Yeong?

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,800
I have no choice but to act indifferent.

62
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,740
Where are you? Can I see you now?

63
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah, okay.

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,730
Let's meet at JJ's.

65
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,320
I'll head over there now.

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,800
This really isn't normal.

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
I said I'm sorry.

68
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,870
Why can't you tell him that you're with me?

69
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,820
You should have rescheduled instead.

70
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,580
When Mu Yeong calls me first,

71
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,360
it means something is going on.

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,860
We see each other every day.

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,800
Every day?

74
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,600
Oppa, we haven't met in a week!

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,020
How about our plan to get wedding bands today?

76
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,910
All right.

77
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,480
I'll bring you a present next time I see you.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,200
Gosh. You're doing this again.

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,690
I'm tired of it.

80
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,560
People might think you two are dating.

81
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,370
Stop joking around.

82
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll get going.

83
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,800
You're meeting another man, leaving your fiancée behind!

84
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,340
Do you know how weird that is?

85
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,340
That's enough.

86
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,490
Something happened, huh?

87
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,780
You even called me first.

88
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,340
No.

89
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,050
Not really.

90
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,630
I just wanted to meet with someone.

91
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,250
Is everything okay with that comic artist?

92
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,100
- Hey, Joon Seok.
- Yeah?

93
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,080
You really are straight, right?

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,780
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,960
Have you ever...

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,070
been affectionate with a man after drinking?

97
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,900
Are you crazy?

98
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,040
Would that be possible if you were bi?

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,930
Bi?

100
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,360
You mean bisexual?

101
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,310
Did you get yourself in trouble with that comic artist or something?

102
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,220
Seriously?

103
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,170
Well, it wasn't anything serious.

104
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,100
It was just a light touch.

105
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,440
I played along with you because I thought you weren't serious.

106
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,550
But it's more serious than I thought.

107
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,370
Don't make it complicated.

108
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,670
Getting involved with a straight man was never good.

109
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,430
Joon Seok... knows all about how I got hurt for having feelings

110
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,480
for people I don't have a chance with.

111
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,570
- You like me?
- Yes.

112
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,740
As more than just a friend.

113
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,880
Then, did you want to kiss me, too?

114
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,260
To be honest, it's kind of gross.

115
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Don't tell anyone that you like me.

116
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,170
Don't act like you know me, either.

117
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:27,010
He must be worried that I might make another foolish mistake.

118
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,020
"Would I be able to find someone I love

119
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,650
- and who loves me back?"
- Hey!

120
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,870
Why bring that up after all these years?

121
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,640
You said that yourself when you were in high school.

122
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,170
- Don't you remember?
- I don't!

123
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,320
That thing called love.

124
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,120
I searched for it everywhere when I was a kid.

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,550
Love isn't a big deal.

126
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,280
Love is a big deal.

127
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,140
Meet someone adequate at an adequate time,

128
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,660
date adequately and get married.

129
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,840
Although I don't believe that anymore.

130
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,140
Right.

131
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,420
It's good to enjoy in moderation.

132
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,570
By chance...

133
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,220
This is my first time watching this.

134
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,470
But it's not as shocking as I thought.

135
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,600
Actually, I found something else shocking.

136
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,870
The fact that...

137
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,470
You're sexy.

138
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,490
I thought of Mu Yeong while watching it.

139
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,810
My heart is racing again.

140
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,470
To be honest,

141
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,530
this happens whenever I think of Mu Yeong.

142
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,750
What's this now?

143
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,550
Why am I like this again?

144
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,740
♫ I tried denying it ♫

145
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,360
Is it because of what happened recently?

146
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,740
♫ I can't seem to sit still ♫

147
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,060
No. It was like this before, too.

148
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,850
Do I really... like Mu Yeong?

149
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,790
Thinking about it, I want to make him laugh,

150
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,040
I want to be with him, touch him,

151
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,860
and I want to see him.

152
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,420
I do like him.

153
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,800
I feel strange.

154
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,870
I have never liked a man before.

155
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,470
Thinking about it,

156
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,080
I have never resisted it.

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,100
Hey, Seon Ho. Check this out.

158
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,200
Isn't it amazing?

159
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,640
How could men date each other?

160
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,130
- Does that make sense?
- I know. I don't think I can.

161
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,350
Is that so?

162
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,470
It's not a big deal if they like each other, don't you think?

163
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,680
Hey, I can't like someone with the same thing dangling as me.

164
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,400
Right, how is that normal?

165
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,720
I don't know. It has nothing to do with me.

166
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,700
I lost because of you earlier.

167
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,880
Hey, Seon Ho. What do you want to eat?

168
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,670
I don't know.

169
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,330
Blackbean noodles? Spicy seafood noodles?

170
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,150
What should I eat?

171
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,690
Just get what you want.

172
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,390
I like both.

173
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,950
Why don't you get a combo, then?

174
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,650
I have always gotten a combo.

175
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,510
I like dogs.

176
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,130
And I like cats, too.

177
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,320
I like latte.

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,150
And I like Americano, too.

179
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,590
With ice cream, I like half vanilla

180
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,390
and half chocolate, too.

181
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,070
Needless to say,

182
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,520
I got half-fried and half-spicy marinade, too.

183
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,610
Do I like men, now, too?

184
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,580
Half-men, half-women?

185
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,970
If Mu Yeong finds out about this,

186
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,050
what would he think of me?

187
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,950
I like you.

188
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,720
For me, men are...

189
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,890
no good.

190
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,080
- I like you!
- I can't believe you saw me in that way.

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,490
I'm offended.

192
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,670
I like─

193
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,590
I can no longer work with you.

194
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,510
I like─

195
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,890
You animal!

196
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,060
No matter what I imagine, he always ends up quitting.

197
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,430
But that night, he definitely...

198
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,680
I might... have a chance.

199
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,830
By the way,

200
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,160
how should I seduce him?

201
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,470
With my looks, words, or ability?

202
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,630
All I have is... this body of mine.

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,170
Should I just seduce him with my body?

204
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,830
What am I thinking about right now?

205
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,230
No!

206
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,410
I didn't plan to...

207
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,280
seduce him like this!

208
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,480
Why does it keep responding? Why?

209
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,820
♫ Because of you ♫

210
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,250
♫ All day, I'm loving you ♫

211
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,500
♫ Still in my heart, I miss your love ♫

212
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,800
♫ No intention of stopping forever ♫

213
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,570
♫ I'm really in love with you ♫

214
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,000
♫ We are starting to resemble each other ♫
