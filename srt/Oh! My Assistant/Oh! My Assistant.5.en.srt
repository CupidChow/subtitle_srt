00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,600
[Hotel]

168
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,500
What am I doing? So foolish.

169
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,090
I don't even have a reason for a heartache.

170
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,420
Hey!

171
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,080
Be honest.

172
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,030
I heard you like men.

173
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,340
Do you date all the men you like?

174
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,930
Does this make you excited? It does, doesn't it?

175
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,240
Are you nervous?

176
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,740
You are, huh?

177
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,460
Let go of me.

178
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,230
Just because I like men,

179
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,020
you think I go crazy over all of them?

180
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,490
Isn't that too simplistic?

181
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,290
Listen carefully.

182
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,830
My preference has nothing to do with the sex.

183
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,390
I'm a human who likes another human.

184
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,100
What's so different about that?

185
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,930
A jerk like you, who's busy bullying someone who seems weak...

186
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,140
I wouldn't want a truckload of them.

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,860
The fact that you're holding me like this

188
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,020
is disgusting and unpleasant, too.

189
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,630
Let go!

190
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,100
Hey!

191
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,340
That's enough.

192
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,290
Didn't you hear what that bastard said?

193
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,070
Go and study more if you have time for this. Leave.

194
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,570
Leave!

195
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,420
Whenever I found someone I loved,

196
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,130
unpleasant things happened more

197
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,150
than pleasant things.

198
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,210
And in those moments,

199
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,460
Joon Seok helped me.

200
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,210
- Hello?
- Where are you?

201
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,630
- I'm in Gangnam.
- I'm in Gangnam, too.

202
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,650
Did you get off work early?

203
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,160
No, I did fieldwork.

204
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
- Do assistants do fieldwork, too?
- Yeah.

205
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,940
Are you in a bad mood by chance? Did something happen?

206
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,430
No, it's not like that.

207
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,190
Let's have a drink since you're in Gangnam.

208
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,400
- Come to JJ's.
- Okay.

209
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,730
♫ It's so hard for me to even rest ♫

210
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,560
♫ But you don't seem to be like that ♫

211
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,190
♫ How could we break up? ♫

212
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,800
♫ I can't even see you ♫

213
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,190
Liking a straight man

214
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,900
never worked out.

215
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,010
Thinking Mr. Shin would be different...

216
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,180
Was it my imagination?

217
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,150
I told you.

218
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,600
Getting involved with a straight man can never be good.

219
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,550
Geez, how could that comic artist be like this?

220
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,850
He did that to you when he had a girlfriend.

221
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,830
Drop it.

222
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,980
Let's stop talking about that.

223
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,920
Do you want another drink?

224
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,650
Right! Don't be surprised.

225
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,840
There are a lot of gay couples here.

226
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,360
Gay couples?

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,810
I know the people who own this place.

228
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,880
But they're a gay couple.

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,080
That's why a lot of customers are gay couples.

230
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,570
But the culture is more open these days.

231
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,140
You're okay with that, right?

232
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,480
Yeah, sure.

233
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,840
Let's go!

234
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,840
Gay couples?

235
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,330
I thought I had nothing to do with that.

236
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,410
Let me pay this time.

237
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,080
It's okay! I'll pay since you're feeling down.

238
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,190
Let me pay.

239
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,600
No!

240
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,390
Ji Min!

241
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,890
I know the people who own this place.

242
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,280
But they're a gay couple.

243
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,580
That's why a lot of customers are gay couples.

244
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,200
Mr. Shin.

245
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,000
How...

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,570
Mu Yeong!

247
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,330
Who's the person sitting next to you?

248
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,440
Well, this is...

249
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,810
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Joon Seok.

250
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,350
Yes.

251
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,290
A lot of customers are gay couples.

252
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,960
Why is he here...

253
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,010
My goodness!

254
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,450
What's going on?

255
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,680
My gosh, my gosh!

256
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,200
- They're really going for it. My gosh!
- I know.

257
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,350
Don't you do that?

258
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,810
- You do that, too.
- I...

259
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,640
I don't do that in public.

260
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,250
My gosh! I guess they don't hide it these days.

261
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,090
How bold.

262
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,710
♫ I'm broken because of you ♫

263
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,610
♫ My hands get fidgety when you approach me ♫

264
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,710
♫ It's expressing how I feel, I don't even know how I feel ♫

265
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,870
♫ It's a problem ♫

266
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,250
♫ I can't seem to hide it ♫

267
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:49,370
♫ You'd end up finding out how I feel ♫
