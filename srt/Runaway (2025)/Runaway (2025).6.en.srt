Hm?

where are we going next?

24
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,067
You told me

25
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,310
that when you were 17,
you fell, hit your head on the stairs,

26
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,234
and ended up bedridden for a month.

27
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,868
Can you tell me more about what happened?

28
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:09,934
Oh.

29
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,767
It was a school break,

30
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,267
so my parents
took me to Chiang Mai to visit Van

31
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,267
since she was attending a university there.

32
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,902
Well, we stayed
at a typical Lanna-style resort

33
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,537
and continued our trip,

34
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,372
until the day we were leaving.

35
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,275
It was so strange.

36
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,652
It wasn't even raining that day,

37
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,734
yet the first step of the resort's stairs
had a puddle of water on it.

38
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:44,868
Because I wasn't careful,

39
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,400
I misstepped

40
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,934
and slipped down the stairs.

41
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,734
The next thing I knew,
I was in the hospital.

42
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,901
Do you remember the name of the resort?

43
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,667
Then, let's go there.

Boon...

45
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,300
I'm sorry I didn't have enough money
for the plane tickets.

46
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,182
It's all good.

47
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,133
We still have a lot of places to go,

48
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,334
so driving is pretty convenient.

49
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,200
Right, I forgot to tell you something.

50
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,501
I didn't have a dream last night.

51
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,267
You didn't?

52
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,601
Uh-huh.

After we...

54
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,968
After I dozed off,

55
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,968
I slept straight through the night

56
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,200
until I woke up to find you
enjoying your tea...

57
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,678
That's good,

every night?

59
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,968
I don't!

60
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,067
Win, are you alright?

61
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,100
No, I just have this strange feeling.

62
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,463
How so?

63
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,634
Like we're perfect pawns,
playing along with her game.

64
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,234
We've been searching everywhere for clues,

65
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,167
yet we haven't found anything useful so far.

66
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,346
It's like Jomkwan is trying to stall us.

67
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,734
As for the cause of death,

68
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,400
judging by Jomkwan's appearance,

69
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,667
I believe she was buried.

70
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Buried?

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,000
Mhm.

72
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,534
Her body has traces of dirt

73
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,467
and shows
some visible signs of decomposition.

74
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:02,868
Typically, a spirit's physical characteristics
are associated with its cause of death.

75
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,300
Do you think she died
from being buried alive?

76
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,801
But her blouse has some blood stains,

77
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,767
so maybe it wasn't all
from being buried alive.

78
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,337
Boon, do you think it's possible
that she's been haunting the wrong person,

79
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,406
or that she's just a restless spirit
looking for someone to take her place?

80
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,178
Not at all,

81
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,934
since Granny Penn knew you.

82
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,200
So how was I connected to her?

83
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,421
I have no idea.

84
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,133
Anything's possible.

85
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,834

110
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,000
the third person was either her or me.

121
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,250
