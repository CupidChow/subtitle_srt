00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:07,941
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

2
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:23,577
Mom, are you awake?

3
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:25,077
Of course I am.

4
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,841
Look how late it is.

5
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,101
How are things going over there?

6
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,441
We've made a lot of progress, actually.

7
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:35,201
I think I'll be back next week.

8
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:36,571
Take good care of each other.

9
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,201
Soulmates are always meant to be.

10
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:40,421
That's my belief.

11
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,601
Mom...

12
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,801
I told you we weren't soulmates.

13
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,641
Alright, alright.

14
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,001
Whatever you say.

15
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,971
But I do like Win.

16
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,701
She looks like a docile little girl.

17
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:58,671
Mom,

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,401
take good care of yourself.

19
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,001
Watch your step

20
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:06,771
and don't skip your meals.

21
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,201
Alright.

22
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:10,871
You too.

23
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,271
Take care of those problems.

24
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,941
So you two can break free from this karma.

25
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:21,071
Sure, Mom.

26
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:22,721
Thank you.

27
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,348
It's gonna be fine, Win.

28
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,311
We did our best.

29
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,541
Boon, wanna know
what happened last night?

30
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:00,571
Mhm.

31
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,871
I'll tell you about it.

32
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,441
Jomkwan called Van "Pimpa, my chum."

33
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,741
And said something along the lines of

34
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:21,341
being betrayed by her friend.

35
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:27,201
Granny Penn was her mother,

36
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:29,741
and Van was her best friend.

37
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:35,671
I think...

38
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:40,831
she's going after everyone
who was involved.

39
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,301
What else did she say?

40
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,611
No.

41
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,441
But Van told me

42
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,071
to find the picture frame
in the hallway to the right.

43
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,401
You used to live here, didn't you?

44
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:23,031
[Jomkwan Norakankul, February 24, 1972]

45
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,771
What's so funny?

46
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,341
Spit it out.

47
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,641
Is this the one, I wonder?

48
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:36,501
Tick-tock.

49
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:38,081
Tick-tock.

50
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,921
[Your search on 'Jomkwan Norakankul'

51
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:55,871
Boon,

52
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,701
can you meditate, use clairvoyance,

53
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:02,271
or touch an object and see its past life?

54
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,271
I can't.

55
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:08,341
I'm not that good just yet.

56
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,741
We need to search for the home

57
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,621
in this picture.

58
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,471
Follow the prophecy
to the woods before your eyes...

59
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,871
Follow the prophecy
to the woods before your eyes!

60
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:40,671
The place shown in this picture

61
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,701
might be the same one
Granny Penn told us about.

62
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,601
Mhm.

63
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,371
But I do think it's strange.

64
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:01,901
Are you saying that...

65
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,501
Granny Penn's hint

66
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,541
might be part of Jomkwan's plan?

67
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,401
Uh...

68
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:17,941
How may I help you?

69
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:20,181
Well...

70
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:24,301
Do you happen to know
where the place in this picture is?

71
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,941
Uh, I don't know, ma'am.

72
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:35,731
It's just that this is such a beautiful
and antique location,

73
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:38,971
so we'd love to know its history.

74
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:44,241
You didn't hear it from me, alright?

75
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,501
The decorations in this place

76
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,871
are mostly vintage pieces.

77
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:53,571
The owner bought
everything from the former owner.

78
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:56,301
And who is the former owner?

79
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,171
Hm...

80
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,941
I'm not quite sure.

81
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,228
But...Mr. Direk,

82
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,641
the former manager, used to say

83
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,801
that it was the property
of the Norakankul family.

84
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,801
And do you happen to know

85
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:22,101
where Mr. Direk is now?

86
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,041
Excuse me!

87
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,371
Is anyone home?

88
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,241
Who are you here to see, may I ask?

89
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,541
I'm here to see Mr. Direk.

90
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:01,371
Oh, you're not from the North?

91
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,321
Where are you from, then?

92
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,871
Bangkok, ma'am.

93
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:07,741
Well, I think you just wasted a trip.

94
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,701
He has already passed,

95
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,671
and was just cremated this morning.

96
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:14,861
Was he sick?

97
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,001
He died of old age.

98
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,501
He passed away peacefully in this home.

99
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,671
So what business
do you have with him, dear?

100
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:29,771
We wanted to ask
about the Norakankul family.

101
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,641
Ah...

102
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,941
The former owner of the resort, was it?

103
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:36,841
I used to work there.

104
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:43,941
Would you mind telling us about that family?

105
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,971
Come in.

106
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:56,241
Wait.

107
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:41,071
Do you think I couldn't get in
just because of that shoddy holy water?

108
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,351
Try me.

109
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:07,328
If you wanna change your mind...

110
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:10,998
Do you think you can fight
the ghost of Jomkwan alone?

111
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:15,688
Never step on those.

112
00:11:18,608 --> 00:11:21,478
A monk on pilgrimage wouldn't come
this deep into the woods to practice.

113

00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:32,648
