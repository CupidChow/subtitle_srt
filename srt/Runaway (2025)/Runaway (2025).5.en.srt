Do you happen to remember
what you told me 23 years ago?

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,200
Why did you tell me that?

18
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,901
And how did you come to know it?

19
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,934
Did anyone tell you?

20
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:18,234
Granny, this is really serious for my life!

21
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,587
Granny!

22
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,393
Please, just say something.

23
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,961
I just need a little information!

24
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:25,262
- You really don't remember?
- Calm down.

25
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,200
- Calm down...
- Granny...

26
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,017
Why won't you talk to me?

27
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,685
This is just a simple question!

28
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,167
I know you remember me.

29
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,968
- Can you please just answer?
- She won't say a word.

30
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,067
She's nonverbal.

31
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,000
How could she be?

32
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:44,838
23 years ago,
she talked to me right over there.

33
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,317
Are you mistaken?

34
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,400
Huh?!

35
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:48,936
Why would you say that?

36
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,371
I was the one who talked to her!

37
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,606
- Why the heck would you say that?
- Enough.

38
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,300
- Let's go.
- Hey!

39
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,667
Hold on!

40
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,020
Boon,

41
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,304
you saw what happened.

42
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,088
Look.

43
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,179
That's enough, Win.

44
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:14,934
Why?

45
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,791
I saw with my own eyes

46
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,384
that she's the same woman
I've been dreaming about!

47
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:25,684
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'm at my wits' end.

48
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,400
Can you think of anything?

49
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,984
Win, you need to stay calm.

50
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,067
If we can't find any clues here,

51
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,817
we've gotta move on.

52
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,501
Then, I guess
we're going to where I used to live.

53
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,150
What else happened
while you were there?

54
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:52,480
If I remember correctly,

55
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,717
I think I fell and hit my head
on a bookshelf in a library.

56
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,434
Then, let's go there.

57
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,117
Okay.

[Grade 1, Class 1:
Miss Samroeng Rakanok]

59
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,345
Shoot!

60
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,780
Sorry!

61
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,515
I bumped into your dessert!

62
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,517
- I'll buy you another.
- It's okay, ma'am.

63
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,984
Are you hurt?

64
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,851
I made her dessert spill!

65
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,133
I'm not even sure if she's hurt or not.

66
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,484
Boon, what's that silly grin?

67
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,801
Before you start
worrying about others,

68
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,517
maybe check your jeans first?

69
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:03,901
They're all messy now.

70
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:06,617
What?!

71
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,133
They really are!

72
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,617
- Uh, Boon? It's...
- Stay still.

73
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:25,504
Face the other way.

74
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:30,664
But...

75
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,250
Hey, I told you to stay still.

76
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,067
It's not like
I haven't wiped you down before.

77
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,791
Done.

78
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,534
Thank you.

79
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:57,490

80
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,234

82
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,567
Boon...

83
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,417
The library is that way.

84
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,651
- Hello.
- Hello.

85
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,634
What are you here for?

86
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm here to find a yearbook.

87
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,701
Did you study here?

88
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:32,009
I did. I was in Grade 1, Class 5.

89
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,551
My homeroom teacher was Miss Aor.

90
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,150
Miss Aor?

91
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,796
Kannikar?

92
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,017
Yes, she was my homeroom teacher.

93
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,450
There she is.

94
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,136
Miss Aor?

95
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,250
Your former student is here,
asking to use the library.

96
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,267
Hello, Miss Aor.

97
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,833

98
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:57,150

Winravee from Grade 1, Class 5.

100
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,794
I used to always fail math.

Win!

102
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,882
I almost didn't recognize you there!

103
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,236
You're a big girl now!

104
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,634
You've graduated now, haven't you?

105
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,367
Where do you work?

106
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,334
I'm a freelancer, ma'am.

107
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,384
Oh...

108
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,634
Well, how's Van,
my favorite student, doing?

109
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,267
She's doing well.

110
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,384
So, why are you visiting?

111
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,751
My...

112
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,665
friend and I happened to be passing by,

113
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,300
so I thought I'd stop by

114
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,117
and find my yearbook,

115
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,267
but...we can't get in.

116
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:55,834
Please let these girls in.

117
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,534
She was my student.

118
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,984
I'm sure
this reminds you of the old days, right?

119
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:01,634
Right.

120
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,417
- Thank you, Miss Aor.
- Sure!

121
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,591
Oh, my.

122
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:10,367
I'd better hurry for my next class.

123
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:14,578
- It's nice to see you today.
- Thank you, Miss.

124
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,609
- Goodbye.
- Bye now.

125
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,671
I really don't like it
when someone brings that up.

126
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,397
Don't let it bother you.

127
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,584
As a kid, I liked being here

128
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,200
because of the picture books.

129
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:59,417
My family didn't have enough money
to buy too many of them.

130
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,367
I used to come here with Van.

131
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,617
Though she was sick that day,

132
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,601
I came here by myself.

133
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:09,311
Suddenly,

134
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,868
this bookshelf fell on me,
and I ended up hitting my head on the floor.

135
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:17,734
Those books crashing down on me
were painful.

136
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,784
Luckily,
it fell onto the one behind me,

137
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,601
or I'd have ended up as
a geeky spirit haunting this place.

138
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,130
What happened after that?

139
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,517
I passed out,

140
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:48,234
and the next thing I knew,
I was in the nurse's office.

141
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,267
How I miss the musty smell of books...

142
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,835
Bookshelves...

143
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,734
Care to reminisce with me?

144
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,284
Whoa, Win!

145
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:28,551
Win!

146
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,434
Run away, kid.

147
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:33,601
Win, come out here!

148
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,258
I'll see

149
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,384
how long you can protect this wench.

150
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,384
Win...

151
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:13,689
Are you hurt?

152
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,708
This is no place for making out

153
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:25,717
or for loud, inconsiderate noise!

154
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,671
Leave, now!

155
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:28,968
- That's not what happened...
- Uh...

156
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,934
Let's go.

157
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:31,934
We're sorry about that.

158
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:52,400
Here.

159
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,367
Boon,

160
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,884
the lady ghost
who helped me push the shelf back

161
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,251
was Miss Samorn.

162
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,234
She was the librarian
when I went to school here.

163
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,517
She was so, so kind.

164
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:05,684
She even helped Van and me
with our homework.

165
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,951
And when I fell head-first,

166
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:11,097
she was the one
who took me to the nurse's office.

167
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:14,968
No wonder she helped you earlier.

168
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:16,862
- Here.
- Oh...

169
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,634
Thanks.

170
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,473
Take the lid with you.

171
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,934
Do you feel as though
something is crushing you...

172
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,196
so much so that you suffocate?

173
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,343
Mhm.

174
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,651
At all times, actually.

175
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,651
But I don't know why...

176
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,898
When I see her, I feel...

177
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,418
even more crushed.

178
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,955
Even with Bia Gae?

179
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:53,789
Mhm.

180
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,576
Do you also feel the same way?

181
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,684
Mhm.

182
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:05,718
The power this spirit has
is something else.

183
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,845
Have you been feeling this tightness

184
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,100
since you were a child?

185
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,616
Hmm...

186
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,601
I think probably since
I hit my head on the floor.

187
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:33,407
And how have you been enduring it

188
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,017
after all this time?

189
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,317
I'm not enduring it.

190
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,184
I've actually tried everything.

191
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,734
It's like she's not letting me die,

192
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,801
but rather forcing me to live.

193
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,484
Considering the prophecy,

194
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,400
she'll probably spare me
until my time of birth,

195
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,984
which is 9.53 P.M.

196
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,609
I don't think so.

197
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,601
You saw her like I did, right?

198
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,334
I did.

199
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:16,133
It's so weird

200
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:18,567
because I've never seen her
until recently.

201
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,100
Right...

202
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,810
Last night, I think she said that

203
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,347
for the next 7 days,

204
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,550
she'd torture me however she pleased

205
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,980
from that very second on...

206
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,410
Something like that?

207
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,180
Could it be that
this place has nothing to do with it?

208
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,910
So this trip is a waste...

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,810
Do we seriously have zero clues, still?

210
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,880
Don't get discouraged now.

211
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,920
- Boon.
- Hm?

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,050
That grandma

213
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,750
has been here since I was a kid.

214
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Grandma?

215
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,980
Yes?

216
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,680
What kind of desserts would you like?

217
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,380
Excuse me,

218
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,247
do you happen to know

219
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,810
what this place was
before it became a school?

220
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,360
That would be 20 baht.

221
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,830
Wouldn't you like some
for that beautiful girl?

222
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,180
Please answer the question.

223
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,100
Sure, and what was that?

224
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,410
Excuse me, Grandma,

225
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,430
but we're in a hurry

226
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,160
and would appreciate
all the information right now.

227
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,570
No need to get fierce with an old woman!

228
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,630
I can be forgetful sometimes.

229
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,830
Back then, this land here
was a residential area.

230
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,330
My mother told me that the last owner

231
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:51,457
sold it to a young teacher,
who was the son of a wealthy gold shop family.

232
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,830
That's why the houses were demolished,
and the land became a school.

233
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,150
Who was the former owner?

234
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,430
I believe he was a government officer.

235
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,210
Word has it that he went around,
borrowing money from one person to another.

236
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,337
When his old wife passed away,

237
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,830
their daughter sold off her inheritance

238
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,613
and fled to God-knows-where.

239
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,406
If you wish to know more,

240
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:15,460
there!

241
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,646
Go ask Jamnian, the one who lives
at the end of the alley.

242
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,007
What else did she say last night?

243
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,430
She told me that

244
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,030
I'd bow at her feet
as she did in her past life.

245
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,480
That means this is not the first time.

246
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,600
Granny, I brought you some desserts.

247
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,740
You know I'm about to die, don't you?

248
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,470
Granny, I only have a week left.

249
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,333
I don't want to die.

250
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:49,303
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫
