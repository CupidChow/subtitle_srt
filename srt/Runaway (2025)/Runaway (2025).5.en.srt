00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:08,008
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

2
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,771
This terrified me!

3
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,071
My heart sank...

4
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:34,271
Cases like this really frighten
the people in the neighborhood!

5
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,071
Excuse me,

6
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,551
what happened here?

7
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,791
Oh, it's you girls!

8
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,011
Hi there.

9
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:49,021
Thank you for helping me.

10
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:53,221
Look, I already went to see
the pond at Preecha's house.

11
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,541
I really found my husband's body...

12
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,491
The state he was in...

13
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:01,101
I'm sorry for your loss.

14
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:04,721
And why are the police here?

15
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,021
Oh,

16
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,401
that's Granny Penn.

17
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,821
She had a heart attack last night.

18
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,538
A heart attack?

19
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:14,371
Yes,

20
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,351
that's what the police said.

21
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,871
They even said that she's been dead
since last night.

22
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:20,961
Who would've known?

23
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,321
She usually sleeps out here,

24
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:26,951
so no one paid her any mind.

25
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,111
Yeah, but Auntie Cheep…

26
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:36,701
Put an end to Jomkwan's vindictiveness,

27
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,171
once and for all, Korn.

28
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:42,071
My name is not Korn,

29
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,191
and I don't know Jomkwan.

30
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,921
You might not in this life,

31
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:54,501
but you did in your previous ones.

32
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,901
What do you mean?

33
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,191
I don't get it.

34
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,931
It is you... Mrs. Penn Masri?

35
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,071
I am, ma'am.

36
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,341
The time has come.

37
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,101
We shall take our leave.

38
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:20,651
Yes.

39
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,521
Jomkwan...

40
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:32,421
I need to go now, dear.

41
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,051
I wish for you

42
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,371
to finally let it all go.

43
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,091
I feel so bad for Granny Penn.

44
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:36,341
Did she die...

45
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:41,521
because I asked about the prophecy?

46
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,671
What are you doing?

47
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,551
Making holy water.

48
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:48,181
(Casting a spell)

49
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:04,751
(Casting a spell)

50
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,871
Is it done?

51
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,151
Mhm.

52
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:22,071
Is this holy water

53
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:25,121
the same kind used in temples?

54
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:27,561
It's not.

55
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:33,351
Those are called 'Phra Paritta' water,

56
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,621
created by the monks
through the chanting of Buddhist prayers

57
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,051
during an auspicious ceremony.

58
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,931
This holy water
is consecrated with the Thorani Sarn mantra,

59
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:51,601
created to undo black magic,
ward off evil,

60
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,421
and reverse calamities.

61
00:05:56,091 --> 00:06:00,341
So that means we can use this holy water
against that ghost.

62
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,321
If that were the case,
I would've done it for you a long time ago.

63
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:17,588
It cannot reverse bad deeds,

64
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:21,471
neither in this life nor in previous ones.

65
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,971
Pour this over yourself,
starting from your head,

66
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:34,241
and then take a shower.

67
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,351
Boon...

68
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,071
Why aren't you asleep yet?

69
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,771
Can I sleep close to you?

70
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:48,371
I don't want to have
another bad dream like last night.

71
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:20,211
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

72
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:25,611
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

73
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:33,171
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

74
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:38,911
♫As this will be the last of me♫

75
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,151
Follow the prophecy
to the woods before your eyes.

76
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:50,908
The place shown in this picture
might be the same one Granny Penn told us about.

77
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,151
[Pimpa, you witch]

78
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,741
I will hurt you
a thousand times more than this!

79
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:00,981
This is a sacred tiger forehead amulet
from my revered monk.

80
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,048
I usually wear it all the time,

81
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:05,831
but tonight,
it seems you need it more than I do.

82
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,121
Hi there, chum.

83
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:22,921
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

84
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:28,491
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:36,091
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:42,771
♫As this will be the last of me♫

87
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:13,891
♫Can I be the one embracing you again?♫

88
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,735
♫I want you to hold me back as your swain♫

89
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:27,251
♫Holding back tears, I will pause the time♫

90
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,551
♫So you won't see the last of me♫

91
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:34,691
♫Should it be the last of me,♫

92
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:43,121
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

93
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:48,521
