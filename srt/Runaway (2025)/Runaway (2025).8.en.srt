00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:07,968
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:10,848
Boon!

3
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:12,328
Are you still okay?

4
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,368
Venerable Sir,

5
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,208
will Jomkwan's soul rest in peace?

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,728
She has created a lot of bad karma.

7
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:37,008
She will probably face
her consequences in hell.

8
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,088
Bear with it a little longer, Win.

9
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:51,168
We're almost at the finish line.

10
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:53,448
No,

11
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,808
you bear with it a little longer, Boon.

12
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:00,128
Does it hurt a lot?

13
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:09,088
Let's finish what we started.

14
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:23,168
[February 27, 2025, 08.28 A.M.,
17 hours left]

15
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,608
This is the spot

16
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,648
where we buried Jomkwan.

17
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,088
That night, I was with Thamon,

18
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:48,528
discussing Jomkwan.

19
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,408
Kwan still loves you, Korn.

20
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,248
Why don't you try
giving her another chance?

21
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,248
But what she did is unacceptable.

22
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,688
I don't love her anymore.

23
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:20,688
Would you be happy

24
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,688
if she kept harassing us
endlessly like this?

25
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:25,048
No...

26
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,008
I don't want her
to be involved with us anymore.

27
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,568
Why don't you try
talking it out nicely with her again?

28
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:43,488
Didn't you say
you wanted a word with me?

29
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,168
What does it have to do with this...

30
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:48,128
Thamon?

31
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,288
Please end things with me, Jomkwan.

32
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:53,208
Don't let it drag on any longer.

33
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:54,008
No,

34
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:55,568
I'm not breaking up with you.

35
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:58,408
I've already told you I still love you!

36
00:02:58,448 --> 00:02:59,928
But I don't.

37
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:01,648
Please let Thamon and me be.

38
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:02,408
No!

39
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:03,888
I won't accept this.

40
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,128
Be sensible, Kwan.

41
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:07,768
A no is a no.

42
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,648
Whatever you say.

43
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,488
I'm also tired of arguing with you.

44
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,808
No matter what,
I'll always follow you.

45
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:26,208
My Korn...

46
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,168
Just accept it.

47
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,248
You won't be able to run away from me.

48
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,648
- Stop it.
- Korn!

49
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,248
What in the world are you doing?

50
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,168
Didn't you hear

51
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,608
she was going to harass us
everywhere we go?

52
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:39,608
As long as she's alive,

53
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,888
do I have to keep putting up
with her dark magic?

54
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,168
Or do you want me to die?

55
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:46,408
I don't want you to die!

56
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,968
But I don't want you
to hurt my little sister, either!

57
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:50,168
I wanna puke!

58
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,408
Stop being such a hypocrite, Thamon!

59
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,408
For someone who steals,

60
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,608
you still have the nerve
to act like an angel?

61
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,408
Think whatever you want, Kwan.

62
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,928
You're just an orphaned b*tch,

63
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,128
a mere parasite,

64
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:12,448
acting pathetic
and leeching off my family!

65
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,048
Don't you talk to Thamon like that!

66
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,408
Bear in mind, Kornkavee.

67
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:27,128
I will kill you and everyone involved,

68
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,448
life after life.

69
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:31,528
May your life

70
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:33,768
be nothing but endless damnation!

71
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,888
I will have my vengeance

72
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,728
and make your life
worse than a living hell!

73
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:56,388
I love you, My Korn...

74
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:01,048
Korn,

75
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,208
I just heard her speak.

76
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:09,848
You're just hearing things.

77
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,528
With her face beaten that badly,

78
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:14,648
it'd be a miracle
if she were still breathing.

79
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:44,568
I will take my vengeance on you
in every lifetime to come.

80
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:58,328
[February 28, 1972,
01.31 A.M.]

81
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:45,818
Boon.

82
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:08,048
Alright.

83
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,128
Both of you,

84
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,568
focus your minds solemnly

85
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,608
during the ritual.

86
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:31,288
(Incanting)

87
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:38,768
(Incanting)

88
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:52,588
Now,

89
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,068
light the fire on the pyre.

90
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,368
Why aren't the bones catching fire?

91
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,528
I believe

92
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:45,448
we need to take them
to the vacation home.

93
00:08:55,608 --> 00:09:00,608
[February 28, 2025, 1.00 A.M.,
30 minutes left]

94
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,928
Set the entire house on fire.

95
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:22,128
The entire house?

96
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,585
This was the place

97
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,065
where Jomkwan and Kornkavee

98
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,728
first consummated their relationship.

99
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:31,928
If we don't destroy it completely,

100
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:35,328
her soul will remain bound

101
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:38,488
and lingering in the past,

102
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:42,528
so much so that she can't make amends.

103
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:45,848
Hurry along.

104
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:47,008
We're running out of time.

105
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,128
Of course.

106
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,848
Thank you for helping us, Venerable Sir.

107
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,688
Karmic bonds can be broken

108
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,328
through the solemn forgiveness
of everyone involved.

109
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,428
You two,

110
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:10,648
commit to spiritual cultivation

111
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:14,448
and live your lives
in accordance with the precepts.

112
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:17,648
Everything that happened

113
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:20,008
was fated.

114
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,488
I have done my best,

115
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,388
and you both

116
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:29,608
need to learn how to let go.

117
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,208
May you be blessed.

118
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:43,608
We should get going.

119
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:12,328
Is it really over?

120
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:17,728
Thank you.

121
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:22,048
I can't even imagine
surviving this without you.

122
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,648
Happy birthday,

123
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,168
Win.

124
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:51,408
Sure,

125
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,168
I'll call you again
when I get to Bangkok, Dad.

126
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:55,968
Alright.

127
00:12:58,688 --> 00:12:59,608
Win,

128
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,768
should we hang out?

129
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:06,208
Sure.

130
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,728
Consider this a vacation, alright?

131
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:12,848
I'm still not used to this, though.

132
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,288
Ever since I came to

133
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,408
the hungry ghost forest and left,

134
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,368
I still haven't seen any...

135
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,168
Ghosts?

136
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:34,328
Why are you smiling?

137
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,168
Just because.

138
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:39,928
How about this?

139
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,328
Let's pick up our car from the mechanic

140
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:42,628
and go explore.

141
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:44,828
Where do you wanna go?

142
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:46,848
I'll take you there.

143
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:48,968
So many places, actually.

144
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,568
The weather is so nice.

145
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:32,488
Mhm.

146
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,728
We've never
taken a photo together, have we?

147
00:14:44,688 --> 00:14:46,008
Should we do that?

148
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:48,168
Sure.

149
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:03,888
Gosh...

150
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,968
What? It's cute!

151
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:53,048
Come on, let's get going.

152
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:10,928
Boon,

153
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:15,035
do you remember
what Monk Jompol said

154
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,468
before we parted ways?

155
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:18,208
Mhm.

156
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,568
Why?

157
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,928
I just have a hunch

158
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,808
that he was trying to tell us something.

159
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,238
What was he trying to tell you?

160
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:34,328
He said

161
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,048
that everything was fated

162
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,548
and that he did
everything in his power,

163
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,808
so we should let go as well.

164
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:48,128
It sounds strange...

165
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,088
as if everything isn't over yet.

166
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,848
But you weren't dead, were you?

167
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,888
If we've made it through the day,
I think all will be fine.

168
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:01,688
I don't know,

169
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:04,208
I just feel like Jomkwan is still around.

170
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:08,648
There, there.

171
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,488
You're overthinking it.

172
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,128
Let's go.

173
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,888
Let's find something delicious to eat.

174
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:44,008
Boon,

175
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,688
we're in a temple!

176
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,528
I see nothing wrong with it.

177
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:49,928
Nope, it's wrong.

178
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:15,848
Oops,

179
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,928
so you finally realized?

180
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,608
I've already told you

181
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,968
that I would follow you life after life,

182
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,288
My Korn.

183
00:18:53,808 --> 00:19:00,878
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

184
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:06,448
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

185
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:14,048

188
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:57,118
♫I want you to hold me back as your swain♫

189
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:05,208
♫Holding back tears, I will pause the time♫

190
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,508
♫So you won't see the last of me♫

191
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:12,648
♫Should it be the last of me,♫

192
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:21,078
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

193
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:26,478
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

194
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:34,048
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

195
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:40,748
♫As this will be the last of me♫
