Father,

20
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,600
could you not be
so hard on Korn anymore?

21
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,280
She already treats me well,

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,200
and she's genuinely a good person.

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Jomkwan,

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
listen to me.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,520
If Kornkavee treats you well,

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,520
why haven't I seen her around lately?

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,960
I guess she's had her hands full.

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,280
She's been working hard lately.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
But if she's free this Saturday,

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,200
she's definitely coming to see us.

31
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,240
Mhm, I understand.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,840
Jomkwan,

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm happy to see you change
for the better,

34
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,360
especially when it comes to the resort.

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,920
I must say,
you've really exceeded my expectations.

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,560
You're doing amazing.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
But I am still your father.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,920
I care about you deeply.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,560
I want you to have a family with children,

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,840
like normal people do.

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
Do you understand what I'm saying?

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Father,

43
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,920
I told you I would prove that

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,120
there's nothing strange
about women loving each other.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,840
If anything,

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,480
maybe it's your mindset

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,200
that's always been bigoted.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,692
Kwan,

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,760
I've lost count of how many times
I've warned you...

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,560
that being with a woman won't last.

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,720
See?

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,838
Do you have any clue
where Kornkavee has disappeared to?

53
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,680
How many months has it been?

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
Right now,

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,160
Danai is there for you.

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,080
Why don't you think about your future?

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,600
My future

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
is mine to decide,

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,640
not anyone's to command.

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,440
If you like Danai that much,

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,600
why don't you just
get together with him?

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Jomkwan!

63
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,880
Go break up with Kornkavee!

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
This is an order!

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
No.

66
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
I love her.

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,960
No matter how many men
you tried to set me up with,

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll never care for them

69
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
because I'm not into men!

70
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,540
Kwan!

71
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,720
You brat!

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,360
Kwan,

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,440
are you alright?

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,400
Leave me alone.

75
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
Why do you look so upset?

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
Can I help you with anything?

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,640
Can you get the hell away from me?

78
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,920
Better yet, stop bothering me.

79
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Kwan.

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,720
Kwan, slow down.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Please talk to me.

82
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,720
Kwan.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Kwan, please wait.

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,680
Can you stop following me?

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,940
It's so annoying!

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,120
When are you going to look at me?

87
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Or do you need to see
that Kornkavee and...

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,240
And who?

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,200
Say it!

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,533
I...

91
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,760
Nothing.

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,480
I just...

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,400
Cat got your tongue?

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,320
Spit it out!

95
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
Say what you have to say!

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
I don't want to lie to you any longer.

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Well...

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,600
Where are you going, ma'am?

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,990
You can't come in.
Miss Korn is with a guest.

100
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:58,400
- God, piss off!
- Miss Jomkwan... Ow!

101
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,000
Ow!

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,400
Miss Jomkwan!

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
You can't do that!

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
My Korn.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Jomkwan?

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Thamon...

107
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Kwan!

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,680
Uh, Miss Korn,

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,920
I really didn't mean for her to barge in...

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
I'll handle this.

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,760
Please get back to work.

112
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,400
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,240
How could you do this to me, My Korn?

114
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,040
You and Thamon...

115
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
It doesn't matter when.

116
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,280
But I have had enough.

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Let's end things on good terms, Jomkwan.

118
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
Why are you like this?

119
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,680
It's because of that wench, isn't it?

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
- Stop!
- She did this, right?!

121
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,120
Stop it, right now!

122
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
- Kwan, calm down. Listen to me...
- Korn!

123
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,360
- Stop! Let go of me!
- Kwan, listen to me.

124
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,520
I said, "Listen"!!

125
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,560
Why are you doing this to me?

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,730
I told you to listen.

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,240
Don't you know how to be calm?

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,800
Does it ever occur to you
to listen to me?!

129
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,694
Is it so hard to understand
that I want to end it?

130
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,880
Can't you comprehend
that I fell out of love with you?

131
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,280
Is it really that hard to listen?

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,560
Can't you grow up?

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,640
Why, huh?

134
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
Because of her, isn't it?!

135
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,480
- You love each other that much?!
- I told you to listen!

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
It doesn't have anything to do with her!

137
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,280
Jomkwan, listen!!

138
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,896
How many times do I have to tell you

139
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,360
that I don't love you anymore?!

140
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,640
- Korn, please stop it!
- I don't love you anymore!

141
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Kwan, could you please just let me go?!

142
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,880
- Just nod for me!
- How could you do this to me?

143
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,160
Go find someone else who loves you!

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,920
Why do I have to repeat myself...

145
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,140
I could have given you the world
[February 27, 2025,

146
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,600
and even my life,
12.34 A.M., 25 hours left]

147
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,520
but you planned for Danai

148
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,081
to show up as the son
of my mother's friend

149
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,400
so you could make a fool out of me
with that orphaned wench,

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,753
even though you knew
how much I hate her!

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't speak of Thamon that way!

152
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
And what are you gonna do?!

153
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,640
Are you protecting that adopted child

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,320
my mother tried to pass off
as a Norakankul,

155
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
just like you did before?!

156
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,680
Stop talking sh*t about Thamon!!

157
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Go on.

158
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,320
Do it.

159
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,320
Beat me up,

160
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,545
torture me,

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,640
or kill me again!!

162
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
Shut up.

163
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Beat my face until it's unrecognizable,

164
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,040
drag me around,
and bury me alive like a dog.

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
Stop right f*cking now.

166
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
And don't forget
to bribe those scummy cops

167
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,320
to tamper with the case

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,040
and spread the story that it was a suicide!

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,680
Win!

170
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
Win!

171
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,560
I told you to stop that!

172
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,200
Hold a phony funeral

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
and harass my family!

174
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Win, stop!

175
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,520
And when my father doesn't comply,

176
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
go murder him and drown him too!

177
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
Win!

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,640
Pol went missing because of you.

179
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
And my father was murdered
and drowned by your own hands!

180
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,960
My home was destroyed
because of you and that Thamon b*tch!!

181
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,920
I already ended things

182
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,360
and distanced myself from you.

183
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,440
You were the only one lying to yourself,

184
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,160
refusing to accept
that I fell out of love with you!

185
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,400
I don't believe it!

186
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
You still love me!

187
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,360
I'll never love you
again for the rest of my life!!

188
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,280
Kornkavee!!

189
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
Thamon...

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,920
I completely forgot that
you're a shaman in this lifetime.

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,520
Stop it already, Jomkwan.

192
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
Let's talk it out.

193
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
You two won't escape death
in this lifetime!

194
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
Not bad...

195
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Fighting won't do us any good, Jomkwan.

196
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,280
I think...

197
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Shut the f*ck up!

198
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Boon, watch out!

199
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Thamon,

200
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
I'll break it to you.

201
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,280
Your beloved older brother

202
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,480
was never shot dead, like you think.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,720
I killed that bastard.

204
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,240
That's a lie!

205
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,920
Dhamma was shot dead!

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,040
Think again.

207
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
That guy went to school
not far from your house.

208
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,640
He saw your brother every day,

209
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,040
so how the hell
would he have shot the wrong one?

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,720
Why would you f*cking do this?

211
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,200
Dhamma had nothing to do with it.

212
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
Why the f*ck did you kill him?!

213
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,600
He had something to do with it, alright.

214
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,600
He was that scum, Danai,

215
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
who helped you two
make a fool out of me!

216
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,160
The reason
he's been keeping this from you

217
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
is that he felt guilty

218
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,040
and was afraid I would torture him...

219
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,840
so much so

220
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,240
that he put on a charade
of how much he loved his little sister,

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,560
when in fact...

222
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
he's been feeding me
information about you!

223
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,720
You will lose everything as I did!

224
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
No.

225
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,320
I don't care
how anyone's past was connected.

226
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,920
Right now,
the person I need to protect is Win!

227
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,400
(Casting a spell)

228
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Jomkwan,

229
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
I never wanted anything
from your family, little sister.

230
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,760
Not fame, not fortune,

231
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
nor even a part of the Norakankul family.

232
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
You didn't want anything from my family,

233
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
but you wanted my lover!

234
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,900
I know I was in the wrong,

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,790
but had I known that Korn was yours,

236
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
I would never have done it.

237
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,160
I would never have let things get this far.

238
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,120
Then, why didn't you stop
once you knew?!

239
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,920
No, Jomkwan.

240
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,600
I really did try,

241
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,760
and I think you know how it felt
all too well.

242
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,720
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

243
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,960
She tried to break up with me
many times,

244
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,960
but I always held her back.

245
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,768
75 lives that I've been hunting
both of you down...

246
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:13,728
That's good,

247
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,578
because you're going to f*cking die
an agonizing death!

248
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,888
Win, what are you doing?!

249
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:21,868
Where are you two going?

250
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,028
Run away to your death.

251
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,797
♫I'm good at losing♫

252
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:31,397
♫You don't love me, yet I'm still choosing♫
