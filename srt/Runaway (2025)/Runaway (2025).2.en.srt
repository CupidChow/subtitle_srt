1
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,234
Finally, we meet.

2
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:21,064
You care so much
about the danger she's facing

3
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:23,934
that you came
all the way here to summon me?

4
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,074
What do you want from Win?

5
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,504
Do you really think
you'll get an answer from me?

6
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:37,174
Answer me!

7
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:40,304
Find out for yourself, then.

8
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:58,354
[Win: Born on Wednesday,
February 28, 1996, at 09.53 P.M.]

9
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:01,384
[Soulmate?]

10
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,984
How do you know exactly when I was born?

11
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,324
Oops!

12
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,724
You do smile.

13
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,194
I thought your emotions
were nonexistent.

14
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,704
- Hello, Mom?
- Win,

15
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:43,204
Van had a rollover accident
on her way to pick you up.

16
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,224
What?!

17
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,694
And...how is she doing?

18
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:48,994
She's still in the ICU right now.

19
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,224
The rescue team said...

20
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,324
she's in critical condition.

21
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,444
Here, I'll talk to her.

22
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:00,794
Win,

23
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,624
I'll come pick you up.

24
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,524
It's fine. I'll be there.

25
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:05,794
You stay with Mom.

26
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,394
Just send me your location

27
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:09,404
so I know which hospital you're at.

28
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,774
Honey, can you share
the location with her?

29
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,144
Please open the door for me!

30
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:29,494
My sister was in a car accident!

31
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,094
Open the door!

32
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:34,894
What are you up to this time?

33
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:36,094
Can you tell them?

34
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:37,894
I really need to go to my sister!

35
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,464
No can do.

36
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,284
Please.

37
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,824
I'm begging you.

38
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,704
She even got down on her knees.

39
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,864
Are you gonna let her go?

40
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,534
Have you told Mom and Dhamma?

41
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,244
I was shocked,

42
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,514
so I rushed here to you first!

43
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,824
Then, tell them to hold her back.

44
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,054
I'm rushing back home.

45
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,744
I'll do that right now!

46
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,044
Duang...

47
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:12,864
Yes?

48
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,864
Don't let Win leave the shrine.

49
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,194
Tell Mom and Dhamma to keep her there,

50
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,394
at least until I get home.

51
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:24,124
I'll make it quick!

52
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,104
Always looking for trouble.

53
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,344
Move.

54
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:44,944
I'll go see my older sister.

55
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,494
Don't go, Win, don't go!

56
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:48,994
But my sister's in the ICU!

57
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:50,994
How can I just stay here?

58
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,704
Please listen to me. Don't go.

59
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:55,194
Boon said you can't leave
no matter what.

60
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,664
It's dangerous!

61
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,924
Again?

62
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,104
After all those 'don'ts'

63
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,244
where is she?

64
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,924
All she's good at
is telling me what to do?

65
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,164
Boon's coming!

66
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:14,744
Whoa!

67
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,244
Please listen to us.

68
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,194
No one here means you any harm,

69
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:24,034
especially not my little sister.

70
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,724
You do have a sister,

71
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,494
so shouldn't you understand me?

72
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,664
Don't come close.

73
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:57,924
Please don't do this.

74
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:00,364
I'm begging you.

75
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,664
Boon's trying to find a way
to help you.

76
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,064
She can help

77
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,764
when she's found a way, then.

78
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:14,624
Win, don't go!

79
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:27,564
I'm sorry,

80
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,334
but I can't hold her back!

81
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:31,594
She's run away from the shrine!

82
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:34,124
Do you know where she's going?

83
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:35,994
I sure do!

84
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,075
Thank you.

85
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:19,774
I'm sorry!

86
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,664
Which floor?

87
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:21,304
4th floor, please.

88
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,364
The same one, then.

89
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:36,644
Win!

90
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:38,724
Go to hell!

91
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:42,794
I'm gonna tell you everything.

92
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,054
Hey,

93
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,664
are we gonna be back here again?

94
00:09:50,294 --> 00:09:52,564
This is where Van's car rolled over.

95
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,024
It's like she swerved from something.

96
00:09:57,704 --> 00:09:59,864
Have you ever seen the spirit that follows you?

97
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:02,224
Do you still see it?

98
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,104
It's in the back seat.

99
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:15,794
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

100
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:21,364
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

101
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:28,964
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

102
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:35,644
♫As this will be the last of me♫

103
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:06,764
♫Can I be the one embracing you again?♫

104
00:11:07,644 --> 00:11:12,244
♫I want you to hold me back as your swain♫

105
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:20,124
♫Holding back tears, I will pause the time♫

106
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:23,444
♫So you won't see the last of me♫

107
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:27,564
♫Should it be the last of me,♫

108
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:35,994
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

109
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:41,394
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

110
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:48,964
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

111
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:55,664
♫As this will be the last of me♫
