that I was such a failure.

21
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,890
I'm sorry I can't make you proud.

22
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,050
Without me, everything would've been better.

23
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,114
Is this what you want?

24
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,814
Come out if you dare!!

25
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,181
Where in hell are you hiding?!

Show yourself!!

I'm always right where you are.

29
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,734
You will suffer death at my hands!!

30
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:17,133
Let's see how long you can get in the way!

31
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,634
Win!

32
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:39,226
Win!!

33
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,167
Are you hurt?!

34
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,701
Van...

35
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,033
Is this really you?

36
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,667
Why would you do something like this?

37
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,901
It's me!

38
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,434
I don't want to live anymore...

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't say such things.

40
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:06,547
Don't.

41
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,814
I'm right here with you.

42
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,133
I don't want to live...

43
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,434
I don't want to...

44
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,133
If I were gone, everything would've been better.

45
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,767
Stop saying that right now.

46
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,681
From now on, don't bottle up what you feel,

47
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,601
got it?

48
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,734
Mom hates me.

49
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,389
She curses at me all the time

50
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,934
and thinks I'm a burden.

51
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,634
I can't do anything right in her eyes.

52
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,100
Mom actually cares about you.

53
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,601
She just doesn't know how to express it.

54
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,542
Whenever I experience something eerie,

55
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,667
she always says I'm delusional.

56
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,334
But I never lied...

57
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,534
I'm telling the truth.

58
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm completely lost, Van.

59
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,434
I don't even know what I'm facing.

60
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,167
Is it a dream or an actual ghost?

61
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,567
I can't even function like a normal person.

62
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,000
It's almost like it's watching my every move.

63
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,801
Win...

64
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,067
Who do you mean?

65
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,501
I don't know.

66
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,601
I've never seen it in plain sight,

67
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,824
but it's been using you as a medium.

68
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,033
No one can help me.

69
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:11,780
There is.

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,300
The woman that the medium told you about.

71
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,000
But she's not gonna help me.

72
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,834
I can't handle the state I'm in right now, either.

73
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,133
Win,

74
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:31,901
listen to me.

75
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,067
If no one in this world can help you,

76
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,734
then I will.

77
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:44,701
Win!

78
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,167
Are you okay?!

79
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,968
Are you hurt?

80
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,834
Van told me what happened.

81
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,407
I'll let you know...

82
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,467
Listen, sweetie.

83
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,400
Don't feel bad.

84
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,601
Everything you've been doing

85
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,034
is good enough.

86
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,641
How about this?

87
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,674
Tomorrow,

88
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,934
we'll take you to a temple.

89
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,434
If you get better,

90
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,667
you can get back to your life.

91
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,080
Your dad and I are gonna take you to a ritual.

92
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,480
To ward off bad luck and prolong your life,

93
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,291
alright?

94
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,734
It's not gonna work, Mom.

95
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,529
Don't be so quick to judge!

96
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,968
You've never given it a try.

97
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,834
If it helps,

98
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,814
you'll finally live a normal life.

99
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,434
Please?

100
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,467
Greetings, Venerable Sir.

101
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,767
Uh, this is my daughter, Win.

102
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,834
May you be blessed.

103
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,621
Your karma truly is grave.

104
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,467
Please help her, Venerable Sir.

105
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,100
You'll need to make significant amends.

106
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,365
And, by making amends,

107
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,134
what needs to be done?

108
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,100
We'll need a rebirth ritual.

109
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,801
It's usually performed during the day,

110
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,400
so lying in the coffin doesn't take long.

111
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,234
But since she is haunted by immense karma,

112
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,650
it needs to be performed during the night

113
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,000
for 3 consecutive nights.

114
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,234
I don't wanna do it.

115
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,901
Why do I have to lie in a coffin?
Let's go home.

116
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,534
The rebirth ritual

117
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,701
is not scary.

118
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,132
It's not much different from an illusion

119
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,970
to trick your karmic enemies
into thinking you're dead.

120
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,372
Once you're awake,

121
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,934
it'll be similar to a rebirth.

122
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,578
But isn't it usually performed during the day,

123
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,367
with just a little time lying down?

124
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:16,701
In your case, it's much more severe.

125
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,734
The karmic enemy
following you is highly vindictive.

126
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,767
The usual ritual isn't nearly enough.

127
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,228
But I don't want to do it.

128
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,067
Let's just go home.

129
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,734
What about the cost, Venerable Sir?

130
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,306
Ten thousand baht for 3 nights.

131
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,173
Huh?

132
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:48,901
Not a problem.

133
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,354
I already said no!

134
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,868
Why won't you listen?

135
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,334
Wait, Win!

136
00:10:58,926 --> 00:10:59,760
Win!

137
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,100
Win, hang on!

138
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,734
Win!

139
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,403
Just wait, damn it.

140
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,033
Stop!

141
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,907
You can't just walk away from him like that!

142
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,567
But I don't want to go through that ritual!

143
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,478
What's all the fuss?!

144
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,746
It's just a ritual!

145
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,167
Calm down, honey.

146
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,400
Win,

147
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,000
just do what your mom asks,

148
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:25,952
please.

149
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,788
No, Dad!

150
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,389
Look how expensive it is!

151
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,834
Mom, keep that money for the mortgage.

152
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,701
How could a mortgage
be more important than your life?!

153
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,234
As long as you're alive,
you can make more money!

154
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,434
But I don't wanna be a burden to you...

155
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,578
Win,

156
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,267
trust me.

157
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,049
It's only 3 nights for the ritual.

158
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,218
I'm begging you.

159
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:03,567
If you're ready, the ritual can begin tonight.

160
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,324
Mom, but I'm far from ready!

161
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,430
That will work.

162
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,467
Mom, I said I'm not ready!

163
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,674
I'll go home with her to pack her stuff up

164
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,868
and will hurry back.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But Mom!

166
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, please!

167
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,734
Let's hurry home so we can prepare!

168
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,868
Don't you worry, sweetie.

169
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,934
No matter what happens,

170
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,067
I'll be right by your side,

171
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:49,367
alright?

172
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,187
Duang!

173
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,434
Why are you acting so childish?!

174
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,854
I've never grown up, have I?

175
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,534
If you keep acting up,

176
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,398
you won't get any red soda tomorrow.

177
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,667
I'll keep acting up
until you agree to help the pretty lady.

178
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,736
She's so pitiful,

179
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,071
so why aren't you helping your own soulmate?

180
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,906
You precocious Kuman Thong!

181
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,067
What are you doing talking about soulmates?

182
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,878
Mom told me

183
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:34,300
you and she were lovers in your past lives

184
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:35,916
and shared the same karma.

185
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,767
So why won't you help her

186
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,801
so her suffering can be eased?

187
