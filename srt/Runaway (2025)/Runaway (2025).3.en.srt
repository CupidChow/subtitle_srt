1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:08,008
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

2
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,761
I need a room for the night.

3
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:29,401
Follow me.

4
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,121
What?

5
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,921
I changed the bulbs just a few days ago.

6
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:58,577
Now, they're blown out again.

7
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:01,441
I'm sick of this.

8
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,081
Can you stay like this?

9
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:06,241
It's all fine, ma'am.

10
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,481
Win,

11
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,921
please come inside.

12
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,321
Are you gonna tell me now

13
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:02,681
why do we need to come all the way
to this shabby room for rent?

14
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,121
We'll talk later.

15
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:07,641
I've something to take care of.

16
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,481
But you said

17
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,001
you would fill me in on everything

18
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,001
if I agreed to come with you.

19
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,681
Boon...

20
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,241
If you're gonna be like this,

21
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,401
I'm leaving.

22
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:28,385
Win, wait.

23
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,921
Go take a shower.

24
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,378
I promise I'll tell you everything.

25
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,241
No more of your games!

26
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,401
You're just trying to trick me.

27
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,961
So you can leave me
while I'm in the shower

28
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,934
without telling me anything
like you did at the shrine.

29
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:44,654
I'm not falling for that.

30
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,294
I didn't leave you.

31
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,414
Why are you so mysterious?

32
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:57,014
You never tell me anything,

33
00:02:57,534 --> 00:03:00,574
and I never know what to do
or where to put myself.

34
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:03,454
Any piece of information
will do at this point.

35
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:06,514
I'm...

36
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:08,814
I'm not good at explaining,

37
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,774
but I'll try.

38
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,751
Just tell me whatever you know

39
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,254
so we can be on the same page.

40
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,094
So, why here?

41
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,094
This place's full of restless spirits.

42
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:45,694
This way, the one who comes after you

43
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,814
will be disrupted by others' forces.

44
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,854
But if we're talking about
a place full of ghosts,

45
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:56,414
why aren't we at a hospital or a temple?

46
00:03:57,834 --> 00:04:00,094
Do you really think you're that tough-minded?

47
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,014
Judging from what I saw

48
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:04,974
last time,

49
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,374
I don't think you are.

50
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,014
Then,

51
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,454
how did you know
my name and date of birth?

52
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:17,134
Well...

53
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:20,694
Duang looked into those for me.

54
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:26,094
All this time, you've been sending Duang
to keep an eye on me?

55
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,294
Um,

56
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,494
only when I have a premonition.

57
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,614
Then...

58
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:38,054
Is that one of the things
that brought you to the temple?

59
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:41,974
I guess so.

60
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,974
Why did you decide to help?

61
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,054
I...

62
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:54,094
I was... I was just curious

63
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:56,954
about how we were involved
in the past life.

64
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:00,194
Were we soulmates?

65
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:01,414
Nope!

66
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,388
I think...

67
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,574
we probably have shared karma,

68
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,294
one that we have to repay together
in this life.

69
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,054
Right,

70
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,854
aside from seeing ghosts,

71
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:20,314
is there something else?

72
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:22,854
What do you mean by "something else"?

73
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,574
Well,

74
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:30,934
like when a stranger
approaches you, says weird things,

75
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,174
or like...

76
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:38,614
talks about stuff that doesn't concern them.

77
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:43,574
Or maybe bizarre dreams and all that.

78
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:44,774
Is there?

79
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:46,614
There are.

80
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:48,854
- There are?
- Yep.

81
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:51,638
Can you tell me about those?

82
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,830
Are you seriously taking notes?

83
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:02,185
Mm.

84
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:05,454
So, can you tell me?

85
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,974
Okay, sure.

86
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:13,054
Everything started
when I was 4 years old,

87
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,814
when Mom and I went to a playground.

88
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,654
I don't really remember what happened,

89
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:20,734
but I was eating a popsicle

90
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,968
when I saw a woman who...

91
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,294
An unknown, delirious woman...

92
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:47,534
with a missing prophecy...

93
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,934
Have any of her prophecies come true?

94
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:54,174
Every single one of them.

95
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:58,254
I saw a ghost for the first time when I was 6.

96
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,574
The very first one
I encountered on my way home

97
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:05,134
was an old, crazed woman on a brick wall,
pulling out her guts.

98
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:07,494
I was scared to death

99
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,294
and had a fever for days.

100
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,894
Once I turned 11, I got pneumonia.

101
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:14,774
I was in critical condition,

102
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:20,094
so I spent nearly a week in the hospital.

103
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:23,294
And once I was 17, I fell down the stairs

104
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:24,694
and hit my head on the floor.

105
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,694
Another critical condition,

106
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,734
a month in the hospital,

107
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:29,974
bedridden.

108
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:35,294
At the time, I broke my collarbone
and left arm,

109
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:36,974
plus some fractured ribs

110
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,974
and a concussion.

111
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:42,254
Luckily, I was able to live a normal life
after all that.

112
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:51,174
And...

113
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:54,174
How often do you have the same dream?

114
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:58,494
Well, I do, every night.

115
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,854
But...

116
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,054
lately, I haven't really dreamed
about that old lady,

117
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:06,454
probably since I met you.

118
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:08,694
Me?

119
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:10,574
What did I do?

120
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:13,434
No clue.

121
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,014
Right,

122
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:19,254
but I think she mentioned something

123
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:23,374
about when I turned a certain age...

124
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:25,350
I could never make sense of her voice.

125
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:28,974
Every time, it's as if
some strange wave distorts that part.

126
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:43,214
Right, Win.

127
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:44,294
Then,

128
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,294
you have to try again tonight.

129
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,854
Really concentrate on her

130
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:53,014
and try to recall the missing prophecy.

131
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:54,734
Huh?!

132
00:08:54,774 --> 00:08:56,694
Try concentrating before you go to sleep

133
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,134
and think about the old lady.

134
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:02,134
Maybe you'll have another dream
and figure out the missing piece.

135
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,174
Are you nuts?

136
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:06,974
Who in the world
can control their own dreams?

137
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,214
You're giving up

138
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,014
before you even start.

139
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:15,414
Right now,

140
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,774
I know nothing about the malicious spirit.

141
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,334
The only thing I can do
is piece together the clues

142
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,184
and make assumptions.

143
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:28,094
I don't understand.

144
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,920
Well, I don't know who she was,

145
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:36,814
but everything happened
at that playground, right?

146
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:41,054
Then, let's go there tomorrow

147
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:42,534
in case there are more clues.

148
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:49,894
What time should I wake up

149
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,294
before we head there?

150
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,054
Boon!

151
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:54,694
Where are you going?

152
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,054
I need to go pick up
something important at the shrine.

153
00:09:58,374 --> 00:09:59,734
Wait here

154
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,614
and focus.

155
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,694
Set your mind to dream of the old lady.

156
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,054
Can I please come with you?

157
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:07,937
I don't want to be alone.

158
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:11,094
Stay here, Win.

159
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,534
Take a shower
and do what you have to do.

160
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:15,774
Then, concentrate

161
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,134
so you can dream of her.

162
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:19,574
But it's only 8 P.M., Boon!

163
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:21,174
Right, and...

164
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:23,054
If you hear a knock on the door...

165
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,534
No matter who it's from,

166
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,254
do not open it.

167
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:27,454
Got it?

168
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:28,974
Huh?

169
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,934
Hey, Boon!

170
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:34,054
Wait... How could you do this to me?!

171
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,094
Win!

172
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,174
(Incanting)

173
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,374
From now on,

174
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:02,014
I will never leave you alone.

175
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:06,334
And for that, I'm not gonna let you die.

176
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:08,814
Excuse me,

177
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,614
do you remember who I am?

178
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:13,614
We need to find a way
to get her to answer your question.

179
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:16,294
Or do we need to simulate

180
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,054
exactly what happened in my dream?

181
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:28,004
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

182
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:33,574
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

183
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:41,174
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

184
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:47,854
♫As this will be the last of me♫

185
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:18,974
♫Can I be the one embracing you again?♫

186
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:24,454
♫I want you to hold me back as your swain♫

187
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:32,334
♫Holding back tears, I will pause the time♫

188
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:35,634
♫So you won't see the last of me♫

189
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:39,774
♫Should it be the last of me,♫

190
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:48,204
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

191
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:53,604
♫Though it's not tomorrow, it will be alright♫

192
00:12:53,794 --> 00:13:01,174
♫Holding back tears when the time is near,♫

193
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:07,874
♫As this will be the last of me♫
