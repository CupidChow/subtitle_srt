I'll give it back to you.

55

Don't sweat it, Dad.

56
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,680
I just have to take on a couple of gigs,

57

Besides,

if I hadn't asked Van
to come pick me up,

60
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,000
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,960
I'm sorry, Dad.

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,840
Sweetie,

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,720
it was an accident.

64
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,680
Don't blame yourself like that.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Got it?

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,760
How did her car roll over?

67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
The rescue team said

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,040
Van veered the car away from something

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,840
and crashed into a tree.

70
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,776
Why's Van dragged into this mess?

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,720
Hm? What did you say?

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,280
Nothing.

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Do you happen to know
where the accident occurred?

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,120
I sure do.

75
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,080
The rescue team already told me.

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,920
Can you tell me everything?

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Normal heart rate.

78
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,520
Steady pulse.

79
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,714
Don't give up, Van.

80
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:26,554
Oh,

81
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,514
it is you.

82
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:35,354
I can hear your heartbeat
like it's blasting through a speaker.

83
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:38,674
Frightened?

84
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:51,434
You needn't walk away.

85

86
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:08,874

of a breathing mortal.

98

Are you the patient's family?

99

Yes, I'm her younger sister.

100
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:22,754
So...

101
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,394
How's my sister doing?

102
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:27,434
She's now conscious,

103
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,674
but I'll keep her closely monitored for 2 hours.

104
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,594
If she's better by then,
we can move her to a recovery room.

105
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:35,474
Thank you so much.

106
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,914

107
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:39,733
