1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,004
What a waste of time!

2
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:11,444
Good thing we didn't have to pay!

3
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:13,234
Don't say that, honey.

4
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:16,034
Why else would you take our daughter here?

5
00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:18,974
Who would've known
this would be of no help?!

6
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,174
Since when did the shrine break?

7
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:24,034
"Since when did the shrine break?"

8
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:26,094
Your sister's car crashed into it

9
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:27,294
even before her seminar days.

10
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:29,234
Do you even care to come take a look?

11
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:31,734
Mom, stop being so hard on her!

12
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:34,004
She's stressed out enough as it is.

13
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:35,434
Let's eat.

14
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,034
I'm hungry.

15
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:04,174
Wait,

16
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,904
where's Win?

17
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:11,774
What?

18
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:13,804
Goodness! What are you doing?!

19
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,544
That's a good pair of shoes!

20
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,574
- Why did you throw it away?
- Mom!

21
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:17,634
I don't want it anymore!

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,274
Let's go.

23
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:19,274
- Come on.
- Go?

24
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,444
Goodness, are you insane?

25
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:21,474
It's still fine!

26
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:23,014
Mom, just let it go.

27
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,214
Let's go, honey. Get in the car.

28
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:24,934
- Come on.
- Ugh!

29
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:27,114
Treating her like she's a little angel!

30
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,104
What a waste of time!

31
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:54,504
The state of those shoes.

32
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,414
Throwing them away
even with just a little bit of dirt,

33
00:01:57,444 --> 00:02:00,304
acting like money grows on trees!

34
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:01,774
Gosh!

35
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:03,334
This is heavy. Take it, honey.

36
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,524
- Sure.
- Honey...

37
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:05,574
That's enough.

38
00:02:05,854 --> 00:02:06,554
Enough?

39
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,104
What?

40
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:08,644
Look at her.

41
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:09,754
See?

42
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:10,894
She's throwing a tantrum!

43
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,764
- Mom!
- Look at what a brat she is!

44
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:13,594
- What?
- Ugh,

45
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,524
- Would you ever stop to listen?
- stop nagging at her!

46
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,134
You're still gliding?

47
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,834
You need to listen when your mother talks!

48
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,004
If you were half of what your sister is,
I wouldn't have anything to complain about!

49
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:26,404
What a good-for-nothing!

50
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:28,414
She was bad in school,

51
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,874
and now she doesn't even have a job!

52
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:33,084
- What good does she have?!
- Mom, I graduated only a year before her.

53
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:34,914
I can help take care of her!

54
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:36,854
Taking care of her?

55
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:39,054
She should take care of herself,
shouldn't she?

56
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:39,894
Here,

57
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,474
come help me with the groceries.

58
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,524
Come on.

59
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,334
Do it yourself!

60
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:45,564
I'm exhausted!

61
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,504
I'm not in the mood!

62
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,634
If she's already well-off,
I wouldn't say anything.

63
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:18,994
Thank you.

64
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,534
Why didn't you want to help her?

65
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,504
If her mind's not strong enough,

66
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:31,134
it's gonna be a wasted effort.

67
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,304
Just give it another thought.

68
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,874
Why do you want me to help her, Mom?

69
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,474
The spirit that follows her

70
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:00,274
is vicious

71
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,034
and extremely vengeful.

72
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,134
Even Elder Master who has immense virtues

73
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:10,034
can't help with anything.

74
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:18,284
But I don't want to leave you alone.

75
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:22,034
I don't want anything bad to happen

76
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:24,234
like it did to Dad

77
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:26,779
and Dhamma...

78
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:37,834
Since your dad passed away,

79
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:44,304
we have been making merit
by helping people.

80
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:49,034
This time, we have to lend her a hand.

81
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:00,774
In 3 days,

82
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:02,664
if she's still alive by then,

83
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,904
I will give it another thought.

84
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:22,584
(Praying)

85
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,954
Do you truly believe
what that old medium said?

86
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:27,724
Praying will help?

87
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,154
How absurd.

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,804
Win!

89
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:59,004
Help me, Win!

90
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:02,974
Van?

91
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,834
Just kidding!

92
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,034
(Praying)

93
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:26,534
You genuinely think
this stupid thread can help?

94
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:34,834
No one can save you

95
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,164
because what you did

96
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,024
is the karma you will pay for!

97
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,274
I can't take it anymore!

98
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:25,374
Just do whatever you want!

99
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:28,544
What are you waiting for?!

100
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,304
Oh, I will.

101
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:35,574
Unfortunately, it's not yet your time.

102
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,804
If I die,

103
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:12,734
everything will end, right?

104
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,204
I'm sorry...

105
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:17,774
that I was such a failure.

106
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:22,774
I'm sorry I can't make you proud.

107
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:26,934
Without me, everything would've been better.

108
00:09:56,424 --> 00:09:57,804
Is this what you want?

109
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,504
Come out if you dare!!

110
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,864
Where in hell are you hiding?!

111
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,134
Show yourself!

112
00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:05,334
Show yourself!!

113
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,534
I'm always right where you are.

114
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,034
You will suffer death by my own hands!!

115
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:17,784
Let's see how long you can get in the way!

116
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:39,174
We will need a rebirth ritual.

117
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:41,034
No matter what happens,

118
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,034
do not leave the coffin.

119
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,934
If you can't comply, it could be fatal.

120
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,574
Mom...

121
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:51,404
Dad!

122
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,554
No, no, no!

123
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:54,254
No!!

124
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:14,804
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

125
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:20,374
