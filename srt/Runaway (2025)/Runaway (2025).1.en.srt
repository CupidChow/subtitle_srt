Little girl...

20
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:21,794
Here!

21
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,954
How generous of you.

22
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,954
You don't deserve what fate has for you at all.

23
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,641
Listen closely.

24
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,441
You might not understand
what I'm about to say,

25
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:37,954
but once you turn 6,

26
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:39,721
you'll have a sixth sense,

27
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,994
and a vengeful spirit

28
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,354
will find you

29
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,754
and never let you go.

30
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,721
As soon as you turn 11,

31
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,114
you will become severely ill.

32
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,834
When you turn 17,

33
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:55,154
you will be involved in a serious accident!

34
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:57,394
And the moment you are 28...

35
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:05,961
Back off!

36
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:07,474
- You will...
- Sweetie!

37
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,354
Are you alright?

38
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:38,514
Van?

39
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,874
It's late. Why aren't you in bed?

40
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:46,114
What's up with her?

41
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,133
Huh?

42
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,534
Hey...

43
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,673
Van!

44
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,096
Shit!

45
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,033
Van...

46
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,577
What's wrong with you?

47
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,667
I have an interview tomorrow at 10.

48
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,467
Shit!

49
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,033
I'm late...

50
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,536
Bye, Mom, Dad.

51
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,434
Win, come grab a bite!

52
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,067
Here, the rice porridge is mouth-watering.

53
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:47,808
- There.
- Gosh,

54
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,046
you knew too well
you have an interview in the morning,

55
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,067
yet you didn't bother to wake up early.

56
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,200
I couldn't sleep last night.

57
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,534
Don't tell me
you have those nonsense dreams again.

58
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,324
You graduated 5 years ago.

59
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,960
Why don't you find a secure job
like the one your older sister has?

60
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,431
But when she takes on a graphic design gig,

61
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,199
she makes quite a lot of money!

62
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,767
Those are just freelance jobs!

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,103
They only come once in a blue moon.

64
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:16,904
And how did those turn out?

65
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,773
Whenever she runs out of money,
Van has to come to the rescue.

66
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,342
You're not a cheap one, either.

67
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,300
Do you know how much
her hospital bills have cost?

68
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,714
Hey, you said you want her to get a job?

69
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,868
Listen to yourself.

70
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,884
With this stressful atmosphere,

71
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,868
what support will she have for the interview?

72
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:32,801
Huh,

73
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,534
this is how you always are.

74
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,259
If you keep spoiling her like this,

75
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,059
when is she ever gonna grow up?

76
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,798
I hope you get the job this time

77
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,434
so you can finally contribute to the family.

78
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:47,734
Yes, Mom.

79
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,234
Win,

80
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,501
don't be so hard on yourself.

81
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,610
If today doesn't work out,

82
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,400
it doesn't mean there are no fish in the sea.

83
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,100
Take it easy.

84
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,467
- Dad?
- Hm?

85
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,290
Van hasn't left for work?

86
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:11,968
Van?

87
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,100
She's been away
for a seminar out of town since yesterday.

88
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,601
She'll probably be back this evening.

89
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,000
But last night I saw...

90
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:20,834
Hm?

91
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,193
What?

92
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,505
Why aren't you on your way by now, huh?

93
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,542
Don't you think it could rain
or there could be traffic?

94
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,611
Fine.

95
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,334
Fine!

96
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,880
- Bye.
- Alright.

97
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,834
Good luck, sweetie.

98
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:46,826
Hm...

99
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,834
Your portfolio is amazing.

100
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,901
I can't believe
no one has hired you yet.

101
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,133
Thank you so much.

102
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,200
What salary are you expecting?

103
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,467
Are you ready to start?

104
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,667
What do you say?

105
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,253
Or do you want me to make an offer?

106
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:23,397
Miss,

107
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,334
what's the matter?

108
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,634
What's going on?

109
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:44,818
Miss!

110
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,667
Miss,

111
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,121
have you seen my man?

112
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,901
Miss...

113
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,795
Help me...

114
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,367
Miss...

115
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,300
Help me...

116
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,501
Please don't touch it.

117
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,067
Is that...

118
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,267
a yantra against ghosts?

119
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,067
Hey!

120
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,577
When people talk to you,

121
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,810
you gotta answer!

122
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,167
I was just asking.

123
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:55,367
Gosh!

124
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:56,801
Uh...

125
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,701
No one can save you now.

126
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:37,935
Your life...

127
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,509
is mine to claim!
