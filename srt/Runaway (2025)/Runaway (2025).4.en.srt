1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:07,975
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

2
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:20,144
The owner?

3
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:22,094
Are you leaving?

4
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,804
Uh, yes, ma'am.

5
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:26,664
The room key is right here.

6
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:30,004
- Boon...
- Hm?

7
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:30,944
It's the owner!

8
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:32,284
Look!

9
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:41,924
I'm not dead!

10
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:44,604
That's Lin,

11
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:46,184
my twin!

12
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:47,274
What?

13
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,194
Sorry...

14
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:53,924
I'm sorry, ma'am.

15
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,994
These kids are cursing me to death!

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,264
Boon.

17
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:22,224
Boon...

18
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:34,544
Why are we stopping?

19
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:36,694
You're hungry.

20
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:38,124
I can hear your stomach growling.

21
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,274
What do you wanna eat?

22
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:41,854
How about...

23
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:45,794
rice and curry?

24
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,474
7 days from now,

25
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,444
there should only be food
from unopened packaged meals

26
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:54,514
to ward off black magic.

27
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,044
Otherwise, it can weaken
the virtues of those who try to protect.

28
00:01:58,414 --> 00:01:59,494
We can't let our guard down.

29
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:01,114
Wait,

30
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,394
does that mean you can't eat

31
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,134
cooked-to-order meals

32
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,744
or anything from those restaurants?

33
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:16,264
We'll just find something to eat later.

34
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,014
Let's go.

35
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:22,614
Thank you.

36
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:28,464
Oops!

37
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,794
Hey, don't eat that.

38
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:34,804
It's gonna be fine.

39
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:36,524
The 3-second rule
says the germs won't get to it in time!

40
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,314
I said don't eat that!

41
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:39,734
Put it down.

42
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:41,444
But it's wasteful!

43
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:44,594
Hey!

44
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:47,944
Why would you throw away food?!

45
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:49,874
Take this new one.

46
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,454
Give them all of that.

47
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,124
If you steal from ghosts,

48
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,054
another one of them
could get angry and follow you.

49
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,244
What are you gonna do about that?

50
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,214
We're here.

51
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,674
I haven't been here for so long.

52
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:27,144
It's changed so much.

53
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:07,194
Do you remember
any details about this place?

54
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:12,024
I used to play on that swing.

55
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:15,494
Though I can't remember anything else.

56
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,594
Hey...

57
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:24,014
Win?

58
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,824
Let's ask that granny.

59
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:47,134
Win,

60
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:51,044
is that the old lady from your dream?

61
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,244
I think so.

62
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:09,334
Excuse me,

63
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,564
do you remember who I am?

64
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,034
Excuse me,

65
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:22,834
do you remember who I am?

66
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:26,344
Excuse...

67
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:31,564
Though you've cast a spell
to blind and deafen me,

68
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,174
I can still smell the reeks of a b*tch

69
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,954
and a nosy harlot vividly.

70
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:41,734
Win,

71
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,544
keep it together.

72
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,364
Were you the old lady
who told me the strange prophecy

73
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,324
at the swing?

74
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,094
Win,

75
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:11,244
let's slow down.

76
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:13,714
She probably
doesn't want to talk right now.

77
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:15,584
But I...

78
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,064
We still have time.

79
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:21,074
What?

80
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:23,934
How come my watch just died?

81
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,344
Here.

82
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,764
Told you we still had time.

83
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:36,174
We need to find a way
to get her to answer your question.

84
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,484
Let's head back for now.

85
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:05,894
Here...

86
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,824
My childhood fav.

87
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,744
Mom used to buy this for me every day.

88
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,094
Take a bite.

89
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:14,644
No, thanks.

90
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:16,924
Why? I just took it out of the wrapper

91
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:18,604
right after buying it

92
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:19,814
from that freezer over there. See?

93
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,674
It's safe to eat!

94
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:28,764
Try it.

95
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:30,634
Try it!

96
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:31,434
Uh-uh.

97
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:32,614
- Take a bite!
- No...

98
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:34,654
Big bite.

99
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:40,224
How is it?

100
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:43,234
Pretty good.

101
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,314
I really miss how it tastes.

102
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:13,764
Yum!

103
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,584
I think...

104
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:27,574
that granny

105
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:30,624
is the one who told me the prophecy.

106
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,124
Do you think that granny can see her?

107
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:50,724
I think she can.

108
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,244
Is it because she can,

109
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,794
so she doesn't want to say anything?

110
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,464
That's possible.

111
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:11,314
I heard that woman call the granny,

112
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,264
"a nosy harlot."

113
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,774
So I thought these two knew each other.

114
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,794
Maybe they did.

115
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:27,214
Or maybe it's about
the prophecy she gave you.

116
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,264
Since she refused to tell us,

117
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,794
we need a way to persuade her.

118
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:54,364
Or do we need to simulate

119
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,374
exactly what happened in my dream?

120
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,244
Mm.

121
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:01,164
Let's try that.

122
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:03,294
Sure,

123
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,344
after we finish these.

124
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:47,224
Here...

125
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:55,674
Are you the same person

126
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,864
who told me the prophecy?

127
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,224
We've never met.

128
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:19,224
You've got the wrong person,

129
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,044
psycho!

130
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:21,374
Shh...

131
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,444
If we've truly never met,

132
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,394
why in hell would I haunt you
vindictively through all your past lives?!

133
00:11:29,844 --> 00:11:31,924
You know I'm about to die, don't you?

134
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:33,594
Granny, I only have a week left.

135
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,414
I don't want to die.

136
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:37,744
Can I sleep close to you?

137
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:41,344
I don't want another bad dream like last night.

138
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:55,084
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

139
00:11:55,624 --> 00:12:00,654
