It's 11 P.M. already?

17
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,184
She's probably stuck in traffic.

18
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,267
Sissy.

19
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,648
Don't pretend to ignore me
so heartlessly.

20
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,100
I know you can see me.

21
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,517
If you're here to mess with me,

22
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,160
you'll get what's coming to you!

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,601
I've got the good stuff!

24
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:24,400
I've already seen your Bia Gae amulet.

25
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm not here to mess with you.

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm just hungry and lonely.

27
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,791
Well, where's your caretaker?

28
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,293
Mom went out for some errands.

29
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,484
I think she'll be back soon.

30
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:41,537
Then,

31
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,184
should you wait and ask her?

32
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,300
I can't.

33
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,901
Mom hasn't let me eat for days.

34
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:56,751
Then, can I leave it there?

35
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,252
Can you say,

36
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,367
"Little Thaddao can have this," too?

37
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,617
Is that your name?

38
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,784
Little Thaddao
can have this pack of sausages.

39
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,167
Is it hot?

40
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,467
No?

41
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:38,851
I've got to go.

42
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:42,533
Listen closely.

43
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:45,317
You might not understand
what I'm about to say,

44
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,840
but once you turn 6,

45
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,358
you'll have a sixth sense,

46
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,638
and a vengeful spirit

47
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,237
will find you

48
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:56,618
and never let you go.

49
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,626
As soon as you turn 11,

50
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,026
you will become severely ill.

51
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,555
When you turn 17,

52
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,555
you will be involved in a serious accident!

53
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,710
And the moment you are 28...

54
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,734
You will die an agonizing death

55
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,659
at the hands of your karmic enemy, little girl!

56
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,250
Win.

57
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:29,890
Was that a dream?

58
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,601
This is my old home...

59
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:23,634
Win...

60
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,547
Van?

61
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:28,851
Win,

62
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,367
help me.

63
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,984
There's no time left,

64
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,701
not much at all.

65
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:36,567
She's taking revenge on us one by one.

66
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,734
Who are you talking about, Van?

67
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:44,317
The prophecy.

68
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,312
I've got to go.

69
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:50,584
Don't forget the prophecy.

70
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,371
Van...

71
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,868
Where are you going?

72
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:00,868
Van?

73
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:04,984
Van?

74
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,517
You will f*cking die!!

75
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,500
[Van]

76
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,510
Van.

77
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,100
Hello, Win?

78
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:09,684
I'm in front of the building,

79
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,317
about to go up to see you.

80
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,017
Van...are you better now?

81
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,367
Mm, I brought some stuff for you.

82
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,990
I'll see you soon.

83
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,133
If you hear a knock on the door...

84
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,717
No matter who it's from,

85
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,501
do not open it.

86
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:31,801
Got it?

87
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,484
Maybe...

88
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:36,817
it's not Van?

89
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,425
Win, I'm here.

90
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:42,534
Open the door.

91
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,150
Win!

92
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,680
What are you doing?

93
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,067
Open the door for me!

94
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,834
What was I like when I was 9?

95
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,765
What kind of question is that?

96
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,150
Hurry up and open the door first.

97
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:42,951
Answer me.

98
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,067
You got 0 out of 20 on your math test.

99
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,793
You made random guesses,

100
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,384
but it seemed like
you were avoiding all the right ones.

101
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,316
I personally had to meet Miss Kannikar

102
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,734
and endure her preaching
for nearly half an hour.

103
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,855
Was that enough?
Are you gonna let me in now?

104
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,217
Quick, the stuff is heavy.

105
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,033
The password.

106
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,317
Huh?

107
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,366
Van!

108
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,767
You got discharged so quickly!

109
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,918
Such stupid questions.

110
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,033
You think I wouldn't know
something this easy?

111
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,574
I've known everything about you
since you were 6

112
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,083
because I shadowed your every step!

113
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:26,968
It's 1 A.M. already?

114
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:44,984
Boon,

115
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:46,785
after you finish packing,
can you come find me?

116
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,244
Where are you gonna start investigating?

117
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,639
Honestly,

118
00:12:52,141 --> 00:12:54,167
I never want to leave you.

119
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:57,923
I don't want to go through another loss.
