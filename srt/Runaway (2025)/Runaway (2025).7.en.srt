1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:07,975
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫

2
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:26,087
Strange.

3
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:29,047
A monk on pilgrimage
wouldn't come this deep

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,323
into the woods to practice.

5
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:32,327
Are we lost?

6
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:34,447
We're not.

7
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,561
The compass points north.

8
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:37,927
We're on the right track.

9
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:53,527
Win, let's get out of here.

10
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:39,967
Whoa!

11
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,047
- Win!
- Let go!

12
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:45,127
Get away from me!

13
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,447
If you see them again,

14
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,807
- throw this holy water at them.
- Okay.

15
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:13,927
Hey!

16
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,007
Win!

17
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,127
Win, are you okay?

18
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,047
Just hang on.

19
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:40,207
Let's keep going.

20
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,207
Quick.

21
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:48,447
Boon?

22
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:49,537
Boon.

23
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:58,927
Boon,

24
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,927
why aren't they following us?

25
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,927
I have a feeling that they're...

26
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:07,687
scared of something.

27
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:09,767
Exactly.

28
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,287
It's like they're scared of something.

29
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,127
Looks like Jomkwan played us.

30
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:30,647
This is the south.

31
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:33,047
We'll probably
have to spend the night here.

32
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,447
But I don't want to.

33
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,087
Can't we just retrace our steps?

34
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:41,247
But it's getting dark,

35
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:42,967
and now we're out of holy water.

36
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,487
The forest at night is dangerous, Win.

37
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:46,167
But I...

38
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,207
Don't push it.

39
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:50,487
Otherwise, we'll really be dead tonight.

40
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,407
Hey, watch out!

41
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:14,807
What's going on?

42
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,687
Agneya ye aggi dahakam.

43
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,527
The omen occurred on Agneya,
the southeastern direction,

44
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:25,407
and it will ignite the fire,

45
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:26,967
burning up the heart.

46
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,127
It's Yama's Omen.

47
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,167
And what's that?

48
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:36,967
Trembling house,

49
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:38,887
collapsing beam,

50
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,687
barn owl,

51
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,647
laughing ghost;

52
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,647
these are the ominous signs from the deity,

53
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,687
warning us of approaching threats.

54
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,047
We need offerings on Bat Pali...

55
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,887
to turn the omen into blessings.

56
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:25,487
Thamon, you're quite a talented one.

57
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,927
You can even make a garland.

58
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,407
I'm making it for my mother.

59
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:33,287
Mother's Day is coming up.

60
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,367
Are you waiting for Piyada, Thamon?

61
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:41,407
Yes.

62
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:45,247
Mother and Kwan
are in town running errands,

63
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,287
so I'm making a garland
to wait for her return.

64
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,567
Then I'll keep you company.

65
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,127
But...

66
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,167
Could you teach me how to make those?

67
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:05,867
Win!

68
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,007
Hold the compass and follow me.

69
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:17,207
Right...

70
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,167
I solemnly offer
these offerings to seek forgiveness,

71
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,927
using a figurine
of Yama mounted on a buffalo.

72
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,047
May you accept this
for the sake of my follower's

73
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,887
and my happiness and well-being.

74
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:32,887
That didn't work.

75
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:34,887
We can't ward off the omen.

76
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,007
We need to hurry.

77
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,087
We have to leave this place

78
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:40,527
tomorrow before noon.

79
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,167
Let's explore this place

80
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,127
in case there are more clues.

81
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,167
Boon...

82
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,007
are you okay?

83
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:21,847
If not, you can stay here.

84
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:23,767
I'm okay.

85
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:24,807
Just got a little dizzy.

86
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,127
Then, stay right behind me.

87
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,047
I'm used to
this kind of discomfort and pressure.

88
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,567
Take your time to adjust.

89
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:55,887
Boon,

90
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,087
this must be Jomkwan's room.

91
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:27,847
Are you afraid we'll win, Jomkwan?

92
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,567
Is that why you keep getting in our way?

93
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,527
Where's that smart-mouthed little lady now?

94
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,007
Whoa, Win!

95
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:14,527
Don't meddle!

96
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,607
Hello again,

97
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:30,247
My Korn.

98
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:34,247
Judging by the face you're making,

99
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,487
do you remember me now?

100
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:37,847
Jomkwan...

101
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,407
you b*tch.

102
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,847
That's rich,

103
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,447
coming from a betrayer like you.

104
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:48,567
You f*cking womanizer.

105
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:55,167
You acted sweet to me in the beginning,

106
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,647
giving me the best treatment possible.

107
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:04,447
I fell for your eloquence
and the phony love you feigned.

108
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,321
I guess my father was the only one

109
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,788
who saw through your facade.

110
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,607
That was why he always warned me
about how vile you were,

111
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,407
begging me to end things with you.

112
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,967
Even though Mom
tried to find me a nice man,

113
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,927
I was so head-over-heels in love with you

114
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,007
that I couldn't feel anything
for anyone else!

115
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:37,407
Win!

116
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,047
75 lives that I've been hunting
both of you down...

117
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,007
That's good,

118
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,967
because you're going to f*cking die
an agonizing death!

119
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,207
Win, what are you doing?!

120
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,167
Where are you two going?

121
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,287
Run away to your death.

122
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,287
Averena ca sammanti.

123
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,287
Hatred only ceases with non-hatred.

124
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,547
Who the hell are you?!

125
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,207
This doesn't concern monastic duties.

126
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:16,047
Piss the f*ck off!!

127
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,517
