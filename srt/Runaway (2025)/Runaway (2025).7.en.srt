- Have some water.
- Oh, thank you.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Thank you, ma'am.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Thank you.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
So, what makes you
curious about that resort?

20
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:08,320
We happen to be looking for antique places

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,361
for our thesis,

22
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,760
and we came across this drawing
with the signature at that resort.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,720
Seems like it belonged to
Jomkwan Norakankul

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,720
who drew it on February 24, 1972.

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
So, we...would love to know more
about the history behind it.

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,040
But the story I'm going to tell you

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,160
doesn't date all the way back
to the Lanna Kingdom.

28
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,720
That's alright.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,480
The Norakankul family
was a wealthy family of Chiang Mai.

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,160
They started with a trading business

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
and later expanded into a resort.

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
My grandfather
was about the same age as Jomkwan.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,040
But the most flourishing period

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,480
was during the time
of my great-grandfather and Jomtup.

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,160
Grandpa had been working
at that resort since he was 17,

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,160
so he knew something

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,880
the family had tried to conceal,

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,800
which was about
the one who drew that picture.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,400
The resort was managed by
Mr. Jomtup and Mrs. Piyada Norakankul.

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,960
Together, they had 3 children,

41
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,840
2 sons and a daughter.

42
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,720
Jomdej was the oldest.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,640
He left home
to serve as a government official.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,720
Jompol was Jomkwan's older twin,

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
and he didn't care about business at all.

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,917
Their parents' expectations
then rested on Jomkwan,

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,640
the youngest daughter,
a spoiled young lady.

48
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:08,310
[Norakankul's house, 1967]

49
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
After graduating from high school,

50
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,040
the twins went to study abroad,

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,040
and news of them faded for a long while.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Once she was home,

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,960
she introduced her Thai partner,
whom she had met in England.

54
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,600
It caused quite a stir at the time,

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,400
as Jomkwan's partner was a girl.

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,320
Her family was well-off.

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
She was the daughter
of a wealthy gold shop family.

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
If I'm not mistaken, her name was...

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,960
Kornkavee, Kaveekorn,
or something like that.

60
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,120
Things weren't as open back then
as they are now.

61
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
Sure enough, her family didn't take it well.

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,160
They were afraid it would bring
shame and dishonor to the family.

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,680
For that reason, Jomkwan made a deal

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,400
that she'd take over the family business

65
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,960
if her family allowed
their relationship to be public.

66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,080
Though it was still a hard truth for Piyada.

67
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,160
She then planned to convince her 2 sons

68
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
to take over the resort,

69
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,640
but they refused to budge.

70
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,920
Not long after that,

71
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,480
they yielded to their youngest daughter.

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,480
That was just like...the beginning of it all.

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,560
Jomkwan decorated the hallway
with her own drawings.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,560
At that time,
she visited Kornkavee regularly.

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,680
They were together for years,

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,840
yet their relationship wasn't a smooth ride.

77
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,320
Many times, their fights turned violent.

78
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,480
When marriage was brought up,

79
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
Kornkavee became distant.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,240
After she was walked out on,

81
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,960
the family condemned her
and added insult to her injury.

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,320
Jompol was the only one who comforted her

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
and acted as her guide.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
Piyada wanted to change
her daughter's mind,

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,160
so she introduced Danai,
her friend's son, to Jomkwan,

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,560
hoping he'd mend her broken heart.

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,320
That only made Jomkwan blow up even more.

88
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,480
A beautiful bouquet of flowers
for a beautiful lady like you.

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,560
Danai brought you flowers.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,428
Have some decency, Kwan.

91
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,160
Kwan, you brat!

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
Haven't I told you?

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
No one can replace My Korn!

94
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,209
Just see him out.

95
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,200
It wouldn't hurt to talk to him, would it?

96
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't embarrass me, will you?

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,840
This is the son of my best friend.

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,960
Do you hear me, Kwan?

99
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,920
Get the hell out!

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
I told you to get out!

101
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Kwan!

102
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
You know full well I hate this!

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
- Get...
- Why the hell did you bring him in?!

104
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,160
- Get a hold of yourself, Kwan!
- Get out at once!

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
Kwan, calm down!

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
- Calm down, Kwan!
- Leave me alone!!

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,880
Go back to where you came from!

108
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,601
Jompol, get your sister under control!

109
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,254
- Piss off!
- Calm down.

110
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,996
I told you to piss off!

111
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
Look at them, Pol!

112
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:31,489
Calm down.

113
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,720
Where's My Korn?

114
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
What have I done wrong?

115
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,240
Why wouldn't she come back to me?

116
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,340
At first, it seemed like Jomkwan
had given up on Kornkavee.

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,920
But then, out of nowhere,
she went to see her.

118
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
Do you know who she was with?

119
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,840
The adopted older sister
whom her mother brought in.

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,760
My Korn.

121
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,240
Kwan?

122
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,040
You...

123
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,920
Kwan, back off.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
Don't mess with my person.

125
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,480
Are you protecting this wench?

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,280
We took you under our wing,

127
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,252
and this is how you repay me?!

128
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Shameless.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,240
Are you so incapable of finding love

130
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,860
that you have to steal someone else's?!

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Kwan...

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
We've ended things.

133
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,640
Besides, she isn't stealing
anything from anyone.

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,320
But I've never ended things with you.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,720
If you choose to leave me,

136
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,920
I'll take my own life.

137
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,760
Just stop it already.

138
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,880
Stop threatening to do that
when things don't go your way.

139
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
You're a grown-up, Kwan.

140
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,640
Learn to face the truth.

141
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,200
You're really not coming back to me, are you?

142
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,200
- You!
- Kwan, calm down!

143
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,160
Simmer down, okay?

144
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,960
I give up.

145
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I mean it.

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,360
Wait for me at home,

147
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,740
and I'll be right with you.

148
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,320
Jomkwan's attempt
to get her attention was successful,

149
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,840
so much so that
Kornkavee agreed to come back.

150
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,250
But since she had fallen out of love,

151
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
she ran away once again not long after.

152
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,240
Jomkwan was so engulfed in sorrow
that she lost her mind.

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,560
She attempted to harm herself,

154
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
slitting her wrist

155
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,950
and trying to overdose.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
Piyada had to bring Kornkavee back to her.

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,400
Kwan, stop!

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
That's enough!

159
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,040
- Darling!
- Dad! Mom!

160
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,440
Someone, help!!

161
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
Call an ambulance!!

162
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,640
Jomkwan!

163
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,680
- Jompol, what happened?!
- Kwan!

164
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,240
Kwan!

165
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Kwan!

166
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
- Kwan, my dear!
- Kwan!

167
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,360
- Kwan!!
- Kwan!

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,920
- Kwan! Kwan!
- Kwan!

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,920
Kwan!! Kwan!!

170
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,120
- Kwan!
- Kwan!!

171
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,670
- Pol, what happened?!
- Kwan!

172
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
What happened to your sister?!

173
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,240
Kwan, open your eyes!

174
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,640
Kwan, look at me!

175
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,760
Kwan... Kwan!

176
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
- Kwan, no!!
- Kwan, wake up!

177
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,320
- Kwan!
- Are you hurt?! Stay with me!

178
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,540
Kwan... Kwan!

179
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,840
Kwan!!

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
- Kwan...
- Kwan,

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
- Kwan! Kwan!
- please talk to me.

182
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,600
- Kwan, please hold on.
- Kwan...

183
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,480
My Korn, you've come back to me...

184
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,660
Please...don't leave me again...

185
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,960
- Kwan!
- Kwan!!

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
- Kwan!!
- Kwan, wake up!

187
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
- Kwan, wake up!!
- Kwan!

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,200
- Kwan, look at me!!
- Kwan, wake up!

189
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,680
Call an ambulance!!

190
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,920
Kwan, stay with me!!

191
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Please call an ambulance!

192
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Kornkavee was gifted a blood-covered present,

193
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,600
her former lover's life, on her own birthday.

194
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,880
Since Jompol couldn't save her
in time, he was devastated.

195
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,980
He was ordained
and never left the monkhood.

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
And what did Kornkavee do after that?

197
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,300
Well...

198
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,480
she asked Jomkwan's parents for forgiveness

199
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,080
and left everything about that family behind

200
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,280
to start a new life with the mistress.

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,680
At her own girlfriend's funeral,

202
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
no wreath was ever sent.

203
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,633
I'm not sure that the story

204
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,732
I've just told you could help with your thesis.

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,680
It seems pretty nonsensical to me.

206
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,240
Not at all.

207
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,000
That's actually a lot of useful information.

208
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
Thank you.

209
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,880
After Jomkwan died,

210
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,920
what happened to the family?

211
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,680
Jomdej went to work in Bangkok...

212
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,640
and worked his way up
to become a high-ranking civil servant.

213
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,120
But once power was in his hands,

214
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,800
he accepted bribes and was prosecuted.

215
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
He ended up in prison.

216
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,560
The parents were getting really old,

217
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,520
and they couldn't rely on any of their 3 kids,

218
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,040
so they agreed to sell their business
to the current owner...

219
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,400
and slowly wasted away
from a broken heart.

220
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,840
And where is Monk Jompol residing now?

221
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Someone saw him
going on alms-round in another district,

222
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,640
but after that,
no one has seen him anymore.

223
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,880
And where is Jomdej serving his time now?

224
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,080
He died in prison nearly 10 years ago.

225
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,120
And where exactly
did Jomkwan take her own life?

226
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,080
At her family's vacation home.

227
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
Hey, and don't even think about going there.

228
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,120
Jomtup built a vacation home
in the middle of the forest behind the resort.

229
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,800
Once all the family members
had passed away,

230
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,320
the home was abandoned

231
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,240
and eventually rumored to be haunted.

232
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,600
Look,

233
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,160
it was so haunted
that the people who went ghost-hunting

234
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,880
never returned,

235
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,640
as they got lost
in the hungry ghost forest.

236
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,620
Hungry ghost forest?

237
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,250
Hold on a second, Auntie.

238
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,120
Is it this one?

239
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,920
Yes, this is the house.

240
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,240
It was the last picture
Jomkwan drew before she died.

241
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
And if we want to go in there,

242
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,640
do you have any hunters
you could recommend?

243
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Goodness,

244
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,600
no one dares set foot in it anymore.

245
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,600
I guess there's a monk on pilgrimage

246
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,520
who keeps to his precepts
in the forest and manages to survive.

247
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,080
Though I've heard

248
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,920
that the ghost hunters
have tied some guide ropes.

249
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,180
Look, if you really want to go in there,

250
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,360
try following the guide ropes.

251
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,400
The hungry ghost forest
is just at the back of the resort.

252
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,954
If you wanna change your mind...

253
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,520
Do you think you can fight
the ghost of Jomkwan alone?

254
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,207
Win!

255
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:22,879
Win, wake up!

256
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:23,712
Wake up!

257
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:34,474
♫Can I have another lifetime by your side?♫
