1
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Wu Yu,

2
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:39,900
drive us there.

3
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,880
Your way of helping people is quite direct.

4
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,479
Your way of rejecting people

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
is quite tactful.

6
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,850
I just didn't want to offend him again.

7
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,240
Are you afraid of him yourself

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
or do you think I would be?

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,080
I certainly know

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,480
you wouldn't be afraid of him, Mr. Shen.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,240
But I was worried about causing you trouble.

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,560
You'd have to deal with my problems again,

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
and that would waste your time.

14
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,660
Remember this:

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
if you don't want to do something,

16
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,570
no one can force you to do anything.

17
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,880
What's wrong?

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,680
Nothing.

19
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,920
I just think

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,440
you looked pretty cool when you said that.

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,170
Stop flattering me.

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,130
Go pack up. You're ready to be discharged.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Great!

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,240
I can finally join the film crew.

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,500
She left with someone else while I was still standing here.

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,240
Mr. Cheng.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I checked her photos.

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,720
Someone put them there by mistake.

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,880
Do you think we might have misunderstood from the beginning?

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,810
Misunderstood?

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,040
I am Cheng Moyang.

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,730
Would any woman not like me?

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Of course not.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,600
No woman could resist your charm.

35
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,440
So what should we do next, Mr. Cheng?

36
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
She's about to join the production crew.

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
Should we go after her?

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,640
No. Pursuing aggressively isn't the right approach.

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,760
We need to cool down after showing excessive enthusiasm.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,280
That way, she won't be able to handle the contrast.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
would come to me on their own.

42
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,400
Alright, teacher.

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
Thank you.

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,040
Thanks.

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Assassin.

46
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,720
You're an assassin now.

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,240
Have you ever seen a real assassin making peace signs?

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,079
Cold.

49
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,920
Brooding.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
Don't you get it?

51
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
Hello, Ms. Nishang.

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
What do you think?

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,920
Should I go say hello to Nishang?

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
I could mention I'm Yu Youyi's artist.

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,320
Maybe she'll do me a favor

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,800
for your sake.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,160
You were schoolmates after all.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
Who told you that?

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
Isn't it true?

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
Or perhaps

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,060
you were more than just schoolmates?

62
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,880
Let's go watch the award-winning actress perform.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,120
Why are you so excited?

64
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
How can I not be excited?

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Shen Yifan always says my acting is terrible.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,960
I want to see how a real award-winning actress performs.

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,120
Why are you dawdling?

68
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,050
I'm going ahead.

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,640
Doctor, how is my husband?

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm sorry. We did our best.

71
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,200
No.

72
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,960
Doctor, you have to save him. Please calm down.

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,680
Doctor.

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
Doctor!

75
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,120
Doctor, don't go!

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Cut!

77
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,440
That's a wrap!

78
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,050
Why are you grabbing me?

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,560
Let go!

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,240
All these scenes were done in one take.

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,370
Her acting is absolutely incredible.

82
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,760
Who are you people?

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,640
Let me go now!

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
What I need is real tax planning.

85
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Look at what you've submitted.

86
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,640
Don't waste our time.

87
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,120
Hello?

88
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
What's wrong?

89
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
I finally realize

90
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,360
how bad my acting is.

91
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
I'm glad to see

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,620
you've faced reality.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,880
Why don't you find me an acting coach?

94
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,920
Now?

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,200
I've got my headphones on.

96
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,240
You said

97
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
once I put on the headphones,

98
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,690
you'd immediately take care of everything else.

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,440
Are you

100
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,890
threatening me?

101
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,960
You're the big boss. How dare I threaten you?

102
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,760
This is just a test

103
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,680
of your almighty superpowers.

104
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,360
Fine.

105
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Open the door.

106
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

107
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm the acting coach Mr. Shen invited.

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,010
I've been here since your first day on set.

109
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Hello.

110
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,120
Hi.

111
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
Not bad, Mr. Shen.

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,840
You're like my personal Doraemon.

113
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,380
Thanks for appreciating my work.

114
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,040
However,

115
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,400
the cost will come out of your contract.

116
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,080
Also,

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,840
you'll need to double the snacks.

118
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,320
Deal?

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Deal.

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,520
Hey.

121
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,170
Little boss.

122
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,700
In ten minutes,

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,240
notify the finance department to resume the meeting.

124
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,120
You're all gentle breeze with your earpiece,

125
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
but with me,

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you're like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves.

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,400
I...

128
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm here to kill you.

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,040
Cut!

130
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,799
That's it for today. The supporting actress's fight scene was good,

131
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,360
but her acting is a bit weak.

132
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,679
Exactly.

133
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,919
She can't keep up with Ms. Ni Shang at all.

134
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,280
What kind of assassin

135
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,559
stutters when they're trying to kill someone?

136
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,640
That's hilarious.

137
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
Mr. Shen,

138
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,920
can you help?

139
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
How can I help?

140
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,040
Are you the actor or am I?

141
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,520
Isn't your acting usually pretty good?

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
I'll arrange a support vehicle.

143
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,160
Okay.

144
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm sorry, Ms. Ni.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,880
Is your injury serious?

146
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Do you need my help?

147
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
That won't be necessary.

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,440
Professional matters

149
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,300
should be left to professionals.

150
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,220
Ms. Zheng Ying.

151
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
The first part was quite good,

152
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,580
but the latter part...

153
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Your emotions didn't quite keep up.

154
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,200
After you pushed Ms. Ni Shang down,

155
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,000
you were completely led by her.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,680
You didn't show that assassin's decisiveness and ruthlessness.

157
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,000
I understand ruthlessness,

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
but how do I express decisiveness?

159
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,360
It means being resolute,

160
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,530
not backing down, not hesitating.

161
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,290
Understand?

162
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,850
Does this really need to be taught?

163
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
I'm sorry. I was too nervous just now.

164
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
If you want to keep apologizing,

165
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,100
you'd better say it to the whole team,

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,810
because you're wasting everyone's time.

167
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,280
Um,

168
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,360
let's take a break,

169
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,370
and get back in the zone.

170
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
Looks like we'll be pulling an all-nighter again.

171
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,280
One day is fine, but I'm afraid it'll be every day.

172
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeah.

173
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,560
A work

174
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,400
is the result of everyone's efforts,

175
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,530
both in front of and behind the camera.

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,180
But what appears on screen

177
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,300
is only the actor themselves.

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,380
Since you enjoy all the applause,

179
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,040
you must be prepared to bear all the criticism.

180
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,440
So I feel ashamed.

181
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
You know, I'm trying hard to act,

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,440
but why is there such a big gap

183
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,840
between me and Ms. Ni Shang?

184
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,640
Where exactly is the problem?

185
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,180
The problem lies precisely in

186
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,970
the fact that you're 'acting'.

187
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm acting?

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,500
Can you teach me how to do this?

189
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
It's like this.

190
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I understand now.

191
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,440
Today,

192
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,000
I just followed what the teacher taught us

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,560
to break down the character,

194
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,880
but I only understood it superficially,

195
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
without truly comprehending the character.

196
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,700
But Ni Shang is different.

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,770
Whether she's in front of the camera or behind it,

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,800
she has already entered the character's inner world.

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,840
When she faces the child actors,

200
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,570
she's a kind and gentle mother.

201
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
When facing me,

202
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,320
she's the superior,

203
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,760
unyielding wealthy family's young mistress.

204
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
She lives as the character,

205
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,160
so of course she doesn't need to act to be good.

206
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,720
Right?

207
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,520
Yes.

208
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,120
So let me think about how to do this.

209
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,420
Learning by doing effect.

210
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,290
What does that mean?

211
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,200
Exactly what it sounds like.

212
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Learning by doing.

213
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,280
You want me to accumulate theory while filming,

214
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
and then the theory

215
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,720
will help improve my acting skills during filming.

216
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,440
Is that right?

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,370
That's correct.

218
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,880
Are you sure you gave her my business card?

219
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,560
Yes.

220
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,880
Not just your card.

221
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,600
I even printed out your WeChat QR code

222
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
and gave it to her as well.

223
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,880
That doesn't make sense.

224
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,280
She should have been able to contact me.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,720
Mr. Cheng,

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
could it be that

227
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,560
it's not that she couldn't contact you,

228
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,160
but that she doesn't want to?

229
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Impossible.

230
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,620
Where exactly is the problem?

231
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,960


232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,160
in that production team, right?

233
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,890
Zhang Zhang.

234
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,120
Go arrange it. I'll visit the set.

235
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,680
Okay.

236
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,600
Don't move.

237
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,980
You're up to

238
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,100
your tricks again.

239
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm the assassin now and you're my hostage.

240
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Behave yourself.

241
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,360
Tell me.

242
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,320
What were you doing

243
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,120
sneaking around Ni Shang's car?

244
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Trying to poison her?

245
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,840
Reporting to the assassin.

246
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,360
My staff injured someone,

247
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,080
so I'm bringing her some medicine.

248
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,880
And apologizing while I'm at it.

249
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Is it that simple?

250
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,640
What else?

251
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,040
Are you sure you're not using work

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,770
as an excuse to get close to her?

253
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm starting to think that the gossip

254
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,480
Xiao Wan mentioned might be true.

255
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,200
The way you look at Ni Shang is far from innocent.

256
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,460
Brother Youyi.

257
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,440
Why don't you tell me

258
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,520
what terrible things you did to her

259
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,920
so I can be prepared?

260
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,200
Nothing.

261
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm not joking around with you anymore. I have things to do.

262
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,090
What kind of manager doesn't rehearse lines with me?

263
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,120
So unprofessional.

264
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
Here comes someone professional.

265
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
Don't you have someone

266
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,120
to trade with in your script?

267
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,320
Go rehearse with him.

268
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,210
I'm leaving.

269
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,360
Working hard is good.

270
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,850
But don't forget our contract.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,200
Cutting off my snack supply would be a breach of contract.

272
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,920
What do you mean by that, Mr. Shen?

273
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,960
Do you simply want snacks,

274
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,920
or are you expressing dissatisfaction?

275
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
Let's be straightforward.

276
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,680
If you have something to say, just say it.

277
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,120
There's no point in beating around the bush.

278
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,640
You're taking this too seriously, Ms. Zheng.

279
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
I just wanted to emphasize

280
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,400
the spirit of our contract.

281
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,260
After all, this is the foundation

282
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,810
of our future cooperation.

283
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,810
Don't you agree?

284
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,280
Mr. Shen makes a good point.

285
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,260
How about this?

286
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,020
I'd like to treat you to a casual meal.

287
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,240
And we can discuss our future

288
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,240
80 billion cooperation project.

289
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
80 billion?

290
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,640
If this domineering CEO act of yours

291
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,900
was taught by Ms. Wang,

292
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,080
she won't be getting her salary this month.

293
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
I've never played a CEO before.

294
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
Can't you just play along?

295
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
How can I play along with such exaggerated acting?

296
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,400
See?

297
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,240
You're still not in character.

298
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
An actor's conviction

299
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,500
destroyed by just a couple of my remarks.

300
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,560
Mr. Cheng,

301
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,160
how did you find time to visit our film set?

302
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,760
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

303
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,840
He's here. He's coming this way.

304
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,320
Aren't you supposed to be a cold-blooded assassin?

305
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,360
What are you afraid of?

306
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,560
Didn't you already say

307
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,200
my conviction isn't that strong?

308
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,660
He clearly means trouble.

309
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,320
Get lost!

310
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,980
Right away!

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,880
What if I can't control myself and make him angry again?

312
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,840
Good judgment.

313
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Worthy of praise.

314
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,920
But with me by your side,

315
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,180
what are you afraid of?

316
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,200
So

317
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
impressive.

318
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Mr. Shen, someone who values time so much,

319
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,080
is actually visiting the film set?

320
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,320
What a surprise.

321
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,680
You're the surprising one, Mr. Cheng.

322
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,640
You come to visit but don't check on your own people,

323
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,240
and instead come to see mine.

324
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,360
What I do is none of your business.

325
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,020
Why haven't you contacted me?

326
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,360
Mr. Cheng.

327
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,050
No need for your help, Mr. Shen.

328
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,020
Mr. Cheng, do you really want me to reject you directly?

329
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120
A good girl should know when to quit while she's ahead.

330
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,320
Then I must be

331
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
a bad girl.

332
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,520
You...

333
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,120
My special treatment for you

334
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,240
has its limits.

335
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,640
There's a song lyric that says...

336
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
You're not me. How could you know my pain?

337
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,440
[Yiyan A66] You're not me. How could you know my pain?

338
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,480
You're not me.

339
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,800
How would you know if I care about your special treatment?

340
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,839
I'm not afraid of you.

341
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,119
I don't want to manipulate your special treatment.

342
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,119
I truly believe.

343
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,599
Since we

344
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,250
owe each other nothing,

345
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,960
we should both maintain our dignity.

346
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,040
Okay.

347
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,730
You've successfully made me more interested in you.

348
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,840
Do you know why I like you so much?

349
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,640
Last time at the hospital, can I choose not to know?

350
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
But I do need to talk to you about something.

351
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,080
Come with me.

352
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,480
I know.

353
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,020
Even though this has been your intention all along.

354
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,720
But I need to tell you.

355
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,600
I'm not the kind of man you think I am.

356
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,930
You sent the qipao, didn't you?

357
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I misunderstood.

358
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,770
I'm returning it to you now.

359
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,400
Let me make something clear.

360
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
What kind of man you are,

361
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,480
I've never imagined.

362
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,880
And please don't define

363
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
what kind of woman I am.

364
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,850
And I'm telling you,

365
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,530
I'm not that kind of person.

366
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,160
All right.

367
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
I've said what I needed to say.

368
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Please leave now.

369
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,490
Was my rejection too direct this time?

370
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,130
Class is about to start.

371
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Aren't you going?

372
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,770
Then I'll quickly remove my makeup and go to class. Goodbye.

373
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,640
Not bad.

374
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
That feeling of waiting for an old flame,

375
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,160
you portrayed it quite well.

376
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,080
It's so difficult.

377
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,680
I feel that ever since my foster father sent my ex-boyfriend

378
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,640
to help me complete the mission,

379
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,180
every scene has become really challenging.

380
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,240
What should I do, sir?

381
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,160
Half of tomorrow's scenes

382
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,920
are with my ex-boyfriend,

383
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,880
but the actor playing him hasn't joined the crew yet.

384
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
It's okay.

385
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,200
You can find someone else to rehearse with you

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,930
to boost your confidence a bit.

387
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,280
Mr. Shen, although you're an investor,

388
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,960
your superb acting skills are no less than those professionals.

389
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,890
Get to the point.

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
Please help me.

391
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,570
Where did you run off to in the middle of the night?

392
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Urgent notice!

393
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,840
The actor who was supposed to play the ex-boyfriend tomorrow

394
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,280
has something urgent come up.

395
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,600
Tomorrow it's changed to you and Master Zhou

396
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,240
doing the breakup scene.

397
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,330
Who are you looking for?

398
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,120
And who are you looking for?

399
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,280
I asked you first. You should answer me first, mister.

400
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,970
Then who are you?

401
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,840
Ni Hao.

402
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,560
Who introduces themselves in the middle of a conversation?

403
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Anyway, I've said my part.

404
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
Your turn now.

405
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,920
Fine.

406
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
My name is Yu Youyi.

407
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm here to find my artist.

408
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
Artist? So you're a manager.

409
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,080
You even know that?

410
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,240
My mom is an actress.

411
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,840
A really good one.

412
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,520
Is that so?

413
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,010
What's your mother's name?

414
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,570
I can't tell you.

415
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,490
Let me take you to find your mom.

416
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
It's not safe to be alone this late.

417
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,810
Let's go.

418
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
Which floor does your mom live on?

419
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
And which floor do you live on?

420
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,640
Which floor I live on?

421
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
I asked you first.

422
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,490
Let's begin.

423
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,960
Wait.

424
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,320
You memorized it so quickly.

425
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,320
I'm telling you, I need to get it right on the first try.

426
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,000
Can I make a request?

427
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,880
As long as

428
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,040
you don't kill, commit arson, or sell children, go ahead.

429
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,240
I don't know why,

430
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,920
but I used to think life was just waiting to die.

431
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,450
It was pretty meaningless,

432
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,090
maybe because I hadn't met you yet.

433
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,280
You're interesting, bright, and full of energy.

434
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,970
You never lose hope even in the worst situations.

435
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
I really want to have

436
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,260
a relationship with you that's more than just business partners.

437
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
What kind of relationship?

438
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,440
Would you...

439
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,120
would you be my...

440
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,080
Alright,

441
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,800
I think you practiced really well.

442
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Your script revisions are excellent.

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Impressive.

444
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,240
I'm going to bed now.

445
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,920
Goodbye.

446
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,280
Mr. Shen.

447
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,440
The doctor said you must control your emotions at all times

448
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
and absolutely cannot get excited.

449
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,090
The script has changed.

450
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,240
So I practiced for nothing?

451
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,800
I'm back.

452
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm sorry. I failed.

453
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
Why is an assassin hiding?

454
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,680
Such a simple task and you failed.

455
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,240
Why?

456
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,800
Speak.

457
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,000
I...

458
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,200
I just felt she was too pitiful.

459
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,560
I acted it wrong.

460
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,840
What's going on?

461
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,700
Let's finish the scene first.

462
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,570
The emotion an assassin should never have

463
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,320
is compassion.

464
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Was it when you first saw her?

465
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,760
Or when she cooked a meal for you?

466
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,400
Sheng Jie, do you realize

467
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,840
some things can change in an instant?

468
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,520
Even the slightest change

469
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
can lead to severe consequences.

470
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,440
All right.

471
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
Did you prepare for this scene?

472
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,580
Why was your performance so poor?

473
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,280
I'm sorry, Master.

474
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,800
I've embarrassed you.

475
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,120
I'm not embarrassed.

476
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
You're an actor too.

477
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,370
If you perform poorly, you only embarrass yourself.

478
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Action scenes rely on skill.

479
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,760
What do dramatic scenes rely on?

480
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,000
Acting ability!

481
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,840
Especially when you're working with an actress of Ni Shang's caliber.

482
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,240
You can't be that much worse than her in your scenes together.

483
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
Who should I act with then?

484
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
Mr. Shen.

485
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,320
Great!

486
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
Today's learning-by-doing guinea pig

487
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
is going to be you.

488
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,400
Mr. Shen.

489
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,720
Why are you running away?

490
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,140
Young Mr. Shen, what's wrong now?

491
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,600
Are you feeling unwell?

492
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,060
Young Mr. Shen.

493
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,800
You seem a bit off.

494
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,160
Do I?

495
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,160
I can't quite put my finger on it.

496
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,400
Since yesterday,

497
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,250
you haven't been yourself.

498
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,010
You want to stay away from that troublemaker, right?

499
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,650
Young Mr. Shen, I'm relieved that you think this way.

500
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,480
What nonsense are you guessing?

501
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,440
Hello, Ms. Ni.

502
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,680
Ms. Ni.

503
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,120
Do you dislike me?

504
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Yes.

505
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,720
But...

506
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,200
Why?

507
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,420
You don't know the reason?

508
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,680
No, I don't.

509
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,420
When you figure out why I dislike you,

510
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,360
you might be able to play this role well.

511
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
You're avoiding me.

512
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,840
No, I'm not.

513
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,560
Why would I avoid you?

514
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,960
I don't know either.

515
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,520
What reason would you have to avoid me?

516
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,440
But ever since we rehearsed that scene together,

517
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,300
you walk away whenever you see me.

518
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Are you...

519
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,370
Are you like Brother Youyi,

520
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,280
not wanting to rehearse with me?

521
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,640
Yes.

522
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,640
I'm not a professional actor.

523
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,900
Stop asking me to practice with you. It's a waste of my time.

524
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,720
Is it that simple?
