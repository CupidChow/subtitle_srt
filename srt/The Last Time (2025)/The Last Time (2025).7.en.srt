1
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:07,461
Can we go back to how we used to be?

2
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:10,901
Pee

3
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,221
I still have real feelings for you.

4
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,741
In the past I was young

5
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,141
I might make some mistake.

6
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,781
Now I’m change.

7
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:32,501
I really love you

8
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,741
Can we go back to the way things were?

9
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:06,661
That the hell are you doing, First?

10
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:15,421
It's good that you're here.

11
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,421
His mind.

12
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,701
If you can't take care of him, I'll take them back.

13
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,061
Clam down!

14
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:22,421
Come on!

15
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:23,861
Why?

16
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,421
You only realize his worth when you're about to lose him

17
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,861
You are damn like me!

18
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,301
I will tell you one thing

19
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,461
Every time when he cry because of you

20
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,021
I really want to punch you on your face!

21
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:36,501
Come on!

22
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:37,301
Hit me now!

23
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:37,781
Come on!

24
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,221
Clam down!

25
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,461
If you can’t take care of your partner like I take care of mine,

26
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,621
I think you should let him go.

27
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:46,861
Stop it!

28
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:48,381
you both stop it!

29
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,181
You guys fight like a dog!

30
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,461
Don’t talk with me!

31
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:08,421
I think you should calm down first.

32
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,461
Go take some fresh air out side.

33
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,101
So you can calm down.

34
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,541
So, what are you going to do about Ryu?

35
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,261
I can’t think any solution.

36
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:37,901
My head feels so light.

37
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,861
I still don’t understand,

38
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,061
Why doesn’t Ryu love himself?

39
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,021
Just take the medicine on time and continue the treatment properly.

40
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,981
I don’t get him.

41
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:52,741
Yeah, exactly.

42
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:56,861
But this kind of treatment isn’t that easy, right?

43
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:57,821
Yeah

44
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:00,181
It's a brain tumor, you know?

45
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,501
It's not appendicitis.

46
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,741
That can just hang around, moving back and forth.

47
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:05,501
Yeah!

48
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,781
Who sick?

49
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,381
I heard that it's a tumor.

50
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:10,981
Who?

51
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,781
Nothing, Risa.

52
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:15,781
Risa

53
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,021
Ryu

54
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,941
has a brain tumor.

55
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,861
Ken, did a ghost just come out of your mouth to speak or what?

56
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,501
Ryu has a brain tumor?

57
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,821
That’s why he hasn’t come here.

58
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:34,341
That's so pitiful.

59
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:41,101
But you know, doctors these days are really good.

60
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,701
With enough support, I believe Ryu will get better.

61
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,581
I know a skilled specialist.

62
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,261
I’ll leave the contact with you.

63
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,101
Anna, you just reach out to the doctor

64
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,821
and mention that I’m recommended.

65
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,101
Thank you, Risa.

66
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,061
If Ryu knew,

67
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,381
he’d probably be happy

68
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,741
knowing that someone cares for you this much.

69
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:04,821
Risa,

70
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,461
besides the brain doctor,

71
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:09,581
do you happen to know any heart specialists?

72
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,461
Who's having a problem? Don't tell me it's you.

73
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,181
No no no

74
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:13,981
Not me! not me!

75
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:20,021
Well, there's someone around here with a heart condition, but it's...

76
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,901
It's a case of weak heart disease.

77
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,941
They don't really want to accept the truth

78
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:31,181
that they're falling in love,

79
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:32,021
and...

80
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,181
Shut up, Ken!

81
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:35,341
Shut you mouth!

82
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,261
Don’t listen to him, Risa.

83
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:38,741
The weather must be pretty hot these days.

84
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,061
The brain is acting all weird.

85
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:44,221
Oh, Anna! Your face is so red

86
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,981
—like a tomato!

87
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,341
Anyone who looks can tell.

88
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,381
Risa

89
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:57,341
I'll leave this heart disease patient with you for a bit.

90
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:59,101
I’m go buy some snacks!

91
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,701
Don't listen to him.

92
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,381
Crazy!

93
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:10,941
Well, I don't know any heart specialists,

94
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,821
but judging by the symptoms, it seems pretty serious.

95
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:20,901
For now, let me temporarily act as a heart doctor for you.

96
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,141
Whoo!

97
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,461
From my analysis with my eyes...

98
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:29,901
Um...

99
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,741
This condition isn't hard to fix,

100
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:35,141
you just need to stop pushing yourself, Anna.

101
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,181
pushing myself?

102
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:39,301
Yes,

103
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,701
Yes, stop resisting and let things flow naturally.

104
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:47,141
Life is short, opportunities come and go,

105
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:49,221
and once they're gone, we can't go back and fix them.

106
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,941
Love disease isn’t that hard to treat.

107
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,461
Just follow you heart.

108
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:01,741
Trust me.

109
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,301
Hello

110
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,021
Just a moment please.

111
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:15,821
I’ll be back.

112
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:16,701
Yes.

113
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,621
What would you like to order?

114
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:56,021
Ryu...

115
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,741
Hello, who are you here to see?

116
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:04,621
Hello, I'm Arm.

117
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,981
I tried contacting Ryu but couldn't reach him.

118
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,301
Do you know where he is?

119
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,261
I’m not sure either.

120
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,981
Ryu didn’t mention anything.

121
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,341
Um, do you have any business with him?

122
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:21,141
If he contacts me, I’ll let you know.

123
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:23,621
If Ryu contacts you back,

124
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,541
Please make sure to ask him to call me back.

125
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,301
Uh, Mr. Arm...

126
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:32,301
Sorry,

127
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:34,781
what is your relationship with Ryu?

128
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,141
I’m his colleague.

129
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:44,301
Okay.

130
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,621
Ryu...

131
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:57,981
where are you?

132
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,781
I miss you

133
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:01,141
do you know that?

134
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,461
What did you order? You're good at this, huh?

135
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:19,261
I didn’t order anything.

136
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,901
It’s just that someone came asking for Ryu.

137
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:23,301
Who?

138
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,421
They came asking at the house.

139
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,341
The name's Arm,

140
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,981
But I didn’t tell him where Ryu went.

141
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,181
He never tell others what you're doing anyway,

142
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:37,901
so it's not surprising.

143
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,981
People like that don’t usually think about anyone else.

144
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:45,181
How about you, Run?

145
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:53,141
Have you ever thought about asking...

146
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:55,141
how he is doing, what he's up to, or where he is?

147
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,021
what he's up to,

148
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:56,941
or where he is?

149
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,301
Can you stop interfering, please?

150
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,901
You're just an outsider.

151
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:04,061
Run!

152
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,101
Ken!

153
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,021
Clam down!

154
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:15,581
I don't want to meddle in your business, Run.

155
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:24,781
I really feel sorry for Ryu for having a sister like you.

156
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,101
I'll tell you as a favor,

157
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,581
P' New has a brain tumor.

158
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:47,541
His eyes might go blind anytime,

159
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,181
you don’t know, do you?

160
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:55,141
when Ryu was suffering from headaches, almost dying.

161
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:58,741
The important thing is...

162
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:05,341
how long Ryu will be able to stay with you, Run.

163
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:07,741
And the reason he's not here is...

164
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,901
because he doesn't want you to see him like that.

165
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:14,261
He doesn't want to be a burden to you, Run.

166
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:30,621
Ken!

167
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,581
You promised me that you wouldn’t talk about this with Run!

168
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,381
Oh...

169
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,501
I’m sorry.

170
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,101
Today, I'm going outside.

171
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,581
I can't stay in this house anymore.

172
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:48,461
I just can’t!

173
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,421
Why is Ryu resign?

174
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,781
I also don’t know what is happen?

175
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:20,661
The result I call you here today...

176
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:23,301
I got information from client.

177
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,901
They want us to work more on a tourism project in Kanchanaburi.

178
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,181
Mrs. Boong

179
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:29,981
Okay.

180
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:31,101
Mr. Arm

181
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:34,501
I’ve already sent an e-mail about client detail to you.

182
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:38,381
You can check what they needed.

183
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:44,261
No matter what, you must complete this project successfully.

184
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,981
Because we've already signed a contract with the client,

185
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,861
You can't be as selfish as before.

186
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,301
and you have to make it successful.

187
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,661
As for the travel expenses,

188
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:59,101
I has already discussed with accounting.

189
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:01,181
You can handle the reimbursement.

190
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:10,821
Do I have to go to Kanchanaburi?

191
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:00,647
Pee

192
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:03,007
Do you think Arm has been acting strange lately?

193
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:05,567
He doesn’t seem very focused.

194
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:09,767
He seems like someone who’s heartbroken, doesn’t he?

195
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,007
Are you free this evening?

196
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,887
Let's go grab something delicious to eat!

197
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:21,927
Shabu!

198
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:23,767
Grilled pork!

199
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:25,127
Or anything.

200
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:26,767
I will pay.

201
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,047
Haven’t you finish your work?

202
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:30,727
Let’s me help

203
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,207
I’ll help

204
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:51,087
it's torn, don’t you see it?

205
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,087
You're really unlucky.

206
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,887
Just stop bothering me already.

207
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:04,367
Just go!

208
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,407
What the hell wrong with you?

209
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,447
Can’t you talk to me nicely?

210
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:15,847
If something's wrong, just tell me.

211
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,207
I’m asking you nicely.

212
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,047
You’re talking to me like crap.

213
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,167
I’m nothing wrong.

214
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:35,887
I’m just hatting you!

215
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:08,207
First...

216
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:10,927
Are you free today?

217
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:22,447
I just wantt to see you.

218
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:26,927
What the hell wrong with you?

219
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,447
What are you doing?

220
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,407
I have something to talk with you.

221
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,087
I don’t have anything to talk.

222
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:48,647
Get out of my way!

223
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:50,607
But I have something to talk with you.

224
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:56,567
Please!

225
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:10,967
I'm not the one you should be talking to.

226
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,047
But it’s Pee.

227
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:22,367
The situation has come this far,

228
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,407
and he still won’t even look at my face.

229
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:29,567
First

230
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:31,647
I know

231
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,327
that Pee still love you.

232
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,447
Even though I love Pee so much,

233
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:42,607
I know deep down that it's too late now.

234
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:49,687
I don't have a chance to make things right anymore.

235
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:53,847
I'm happy for you, though.

236
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:57,647
Please take care him for me

237
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:03,847
I think...

238
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:05,767
you're misunderstanding something, aren’t you?

239
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:08,727
I don’t know how I”m going to tell you.

240
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,607
But there’s one thing I can tell you.

241
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:15,207
He loves you a lot.

242
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,927
He never thought about betraying you, not even for a second.

243
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,407
The one who misunderstood is you.

244
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:26,127
I think...

245
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:27,847
Go reflect on yourself

246
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:30,447
before you lose him forever.

247
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,167
What do you mean?

248
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,647
He came to ask for my advice.

249
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,887
What?

250
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:07,967
What wrong with you?

251
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:10,327
What was happened?

252
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,167
Is it about Eak?

253
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:25,407
It’s okay.

254
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:27,447
Can you tel me what was happens?

255
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:39,727
I don’t want to feel this anymore.

256
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,167
It...

257
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:49,927
Eak Told me that

258
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:54,007
he not sure

259
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,367
that he like woman

260
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:58,327
or men

261
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,287
And he asking me to wait.

262
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,047
How long do I have to wait?

263
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,007
I'm really heartbroken, First.

264
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:23,767
I don’t know

265
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:27,847
why he doing this?

266
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,127
Do you love him?

267
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:55,487
I don’t want to be like this anymore...

268
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,007
What are you going to do after this?

269
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:12,247
I think...

270
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,847
It looks like we won’t be able to go forward with him anymore.

271
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:20,927
I think I’m going to quit

272
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:23,847
and go study abroad.

273
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:30,767
Are you sure about this?

274
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:37,287
If it is...

275
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:42,087
I’m always ready supporting you.

276
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:00,567
What...

277
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,367
You heard me correctly.

278
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,967
This will be your last chance for you, Eak.

279
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,127
This is all I can do to help you

280
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:51,807
Pee

281
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:53,287
You have to understanding me

282
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:54,767
I’m not ready to tell anyone.

283
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:56,847
Also,

284
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,167
I’m not sure if I like guys or girls.

285
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,967
So what do you want me to understand?

286
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,247
If you feel good to me,

287
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,847
then just be with me.

288
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,047
But why...

289
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:10,367
are you trying to stop talking to me like this?

290
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:15,127
And who’s going to take responsibility for the feelings I gave you?

291
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:18,367
Let me tell you something,

292
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,367
every time he cries and gets hurt because of you,

293
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,767
I just want to punch you in the face to make you realize.

294
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,327
Come on, Do it now!

295
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:28,527
If you can’t take care of your partner like I take care of mine,

296
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,527
then I think you should let him go.

297
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,767
Go reflect on yourself and figure out what you really want,

298
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,367
then come back and tell me.

299
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,567
But I can’t promise that I’ll wait.

300
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,127
He really love you.

301
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,967
He never once thought about betraying you, not even for a second.

302
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:47,247
Go reflect on yourself first.

303
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:49,847
be for you loosing him forever

304
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,167
This will be your last chance, Eak!

305
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,367
This is all I can do to help you

306
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:37,722
How was your lesson with the teacher today?

307
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:39,082
Are you understand?

308
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:40,882
Understand!

309
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,362
Good job!

310
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:43,562
And...

311
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:47,122
Where is your parents taking you on the weekend?

312
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:50,362
My parents said they will take me to an amusement park.

313
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:53,602
But actually, I would prefer to go to Khao Yai.

314
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:57,362
But thy have already made a decision, so I can't disagree.

315
00:25:58,122 --> 00:25:59,762
Nok, are you forgeting?

316
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:00,402
On the way back,

317
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:02,962
You can ask my parents to take me to an amusement park instead.

318
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:07,002
Teacher, I’ve already decided that I want to ride the Viking.

319
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:07,842
Oh wow!

320
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:09,722
That's great!

321
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:13,642
Aren’t you afraid? If it were me, I’d pass on that.

322
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:14,082
Ha ha ha ha

323
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:18,282
As for me, I’m going to the beach.

324
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:19,682
We're going to Bang Saen.

325
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:22,362
My parents like to take us there on weekends

326
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:28,922
At the end of the year, they said they will take me to Japan.

327
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:30,282
Wow!

328
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,722
I heard they’ve already booked the tickets.

329
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,202
As for me,

330
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,522
I have dance classes

331
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,522
and singing lessons

332
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:40,762
that my mom signed me up for.

333
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:41,522
But actually,

334
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,522
I would prefer to go to the beach like Pim.

335
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:46,882
Run!

336
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:49,202
Where will your parents take you?

337
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:58,642
Um...

338
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:03,242
Are you asking where Ryu is going to take you?

339
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,002
My bottle is empty, I'll go refill it for you.

340
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,562
I told you

341
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:21,122
not to bring this crazy kid

342
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,922
into my house

343
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:27,962
and make them a burden.

344
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,482
Are you sure

345
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:32,762
this is your sibling?

346
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:37,402
Do you really believe

347
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,762
it's my flesh and blood?

348
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:46,522
A kid like this,

349
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,282
if they keep avoiding things,

350
00:27:48,282 --> 00:27:50,282
will only end up with a low life.

351
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:52,522
Dad!

352
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,362
The reason Narin died from a broken heart

353
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,122
is because of my father, right?

354
00:27:58,522 --> 00:27:59,322
Me?

355
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:01,562
Do you know what?

356
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:06,242
Her mother isn’t exactly a good woman either.

357
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,802
I don't know how many men she's been with.

358
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:18,202
I’ve stopped contacting her.

359
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:19,522
I’ve stopped giving her money,

360
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,042
that should be fair enough, right?

361
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:24,922
I’ll say it once.

362
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:29,322
You all need to get this crazy kid

363
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:32,362
out of my house as soon as possible.

364
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,522
Okay!

365
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:47,042
I’ll go with her!

366
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:50,162
Hey, you.

367
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:51,602
Ryu!

368
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,362
Are you trying to challenge me?

369
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:55,922
He has a brain tumor.

370
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,962
I don't know how much longer he can stay with you, Run!

371
00:29:02,722 --> 00:29:04,762
Because of personal anger,

372
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:06,922
I’m ended up taking it out on you.

373
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:10,282
You didn’t do anything wrong. Ryu,

374
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:11,922
I’m sorry.

375
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:13,362
It’s my own foolishness.

376
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:16,122
I didn’t want it to turn out this way either.

377
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:00,802
Thank you.

378
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:18,002
Ryu!

379
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:22,962
Ryu!

380
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:29,722
Ryu

381
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,362
What are you doing here?

382
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:33,642
You know that toon...

383
00:30:33,642 --> 00:30:34,962
What the hell are you doing at my house?

384
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:40,642
Coming to my house like this,

385
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:42,762
if you want to die so badly, you should have just said so.

386
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:43,682
Toon!

387
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:46,642
Clam down first!

388
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,522
I’ve been wanting to tell you something for a long time.

389
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:49,322
Shut the fuck up, Tin!

390
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,522
THat’s great!

391
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:54,522
That you are here!

392
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:55,762
I don’t have to make it difficult for myself.

393
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,362
Toon!

394
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:58,402
It’s time for you!

395
00:30:59,762 --> 00:31:00,362
You going to die today!

396
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:01,522
You!

397
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:04,002
I’ll repay you for everything, both the principal and the interest.

398
00:31:04,002 --> 00:31:05,522
Just be a ghost guarding my house.

399
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:07,602
Why are you stopoing me?

400
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:15,282
Are you pretending to be all tough?

401
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:17,202
Hum?

402
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:18,322
Wait for me!

403
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,282
Are you okay?

404
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:28,402
I'm going to kill you.

405
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:31,002
Hey!

406
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:31,522
Stop it!

407
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:32,402
Clam down!

408
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:33,202
Hey!

409
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:34,282
Get off me!

410
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:35,682
Stop it!

411
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:37,682
Get off me!

412
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:38,842
Get off me!

413
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:40,762
Let me go!

414
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,002
Let me go!

415
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,202
Let me go!

416
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,762
You're have to face bullets!

417
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:45,562
Let me go!

418
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:46,002
Stop!

419
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:46,442
Let me go!

420
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:46,922
I’m going to kill him!

421
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:48,082
Let me go!

422
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:49,562
Let me go!

423
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:51,802
I’m going to kill him!

424
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:53,042
I’m here for you!

425
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:57,322
Tin

426
00:31:58,562 --> 00:31:59,602
get off him.

427
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,002
I understand

428
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:04,722
How he feel.

429
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,642
Woo!

430
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:10,242
A Hero!

431
00:32:11,882 --> 00:32:13,442
But the hero can die at the end too.

432
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:14,202
Let’s me go!

433
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:17,242
Die today, then.

434
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:17,522
Stop!

435
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:21,562
If you don’t see me as a mother,

436
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:24,562
then I’ll die today along with Ryu.

437
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:26,322
Mom!

438
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:27,322
Mom!

439
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:39,002
Mom!

440
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,722
you're taking the side of the person who hurt me.

441
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,082
If it weren’t for him,

442
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:45,522
our family wouldn’t have to struggle like this, Mom.

443
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:49,922
You do it youself!

444
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:54,122
All the terrible things that happened

445
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:57,282
were because of you.

446
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:01,722
The one possessed by a gambling addiction.

447
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,122
It’s you!

448
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,762
The one who embezzled from the company

449
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:08,922
It’s you!

450
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:14,202
Do you really not know,

451
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:17,722
or are you just pretending to be ignorant?

452
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,962
Everyone make mistakes, Mom.

453
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,962
If I didn’t go to jail, I could make money.

454
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,522
I can handle everything!

455
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:34,722
Why are you taking his side, Mom?

456
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:37,522
Stop blaming others already.

457
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:42,922
Stop barking and stop biting others like a crazy dog.

458
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:46,042
If we don’t have him...

459
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:50,722
Not even a place to rest

460
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:52,802
We won’t have it!

461
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:54,522
Do you understand?

462
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:57,962
What are you talking?

463
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:01,842
It’s him

464
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:04,842
who redeemed the house you mortgaged.

465
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:07,282
The house you mortgaged to pay off your gambling debt.

466
00:34:07,522 --> 00:34:10,082
Don’t think that we don’t know.

467
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,322
"And when you were in jail,

468
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:17,402
the one who took care of the expenses and medical costs for Mom,

469
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:19,282
because she was heartbroken over you,

470
00:34:19,962 --> 00:34:22,522
The one who helped find ways for us to make a living

471
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:24,762
and have income until today

472
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,722
is also him!

473
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:29,722
What the hell is this?

474
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:35,642
The reason Mom and I didn’t tell you about this

475
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:37,602
is because he asked us not to.

476
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:44,122
He didn’t want to bring up the past

477
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:46,162
so you could forget it faster.

478
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:48,042
But I never thought

479
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:52,722
that when you got out, you'd end up like this—full of hatred,

480
00:34:52,922 --> 00:34:54,562
thinking only about revenge.

481
00:34:57,522 --> 00:34:58,722
If you’re going to be like this

482
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:02,122
and make Mom sad every day,

483
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:05,562
I think you should go back to jail.

484
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,202
Toon

485
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:16,922
you don’t have to overthink it.

486
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,162
Everything I did,

487
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,322
I did because

488
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:27,162
I felt like I was a part of it.

489
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:29,482
That led to that happening.

490
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:32,282
And the reason I came here

491
00:35:34,722 --> 00:35:35,802
is that I just want to apologize to you.

492
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,522
I'm sorry, Aunt.

493
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,002
I'm sorry, Toon.

494
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:12,322
You don’t have to do this.

495
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,682
It my false.

496
00:36:26,002 --> 00:36:27,002
I let my anger cloud my judgment,

497
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:30,002
not realizing that I was wrong,

498
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:33,722
which ended up hurting the people I love.

499
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:56,602
I’m sorry.

500
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:06,602
Iet’s begin again.

501
00:37:08,322 --> 00:37:09,482
I’m sorry, mom.

502
00:37:10,082 --> 00:37:10,882
Sorry, Tin.

503
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:24,922
No matter what happens to me from now on,

504
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:27,322
there’s nothing I need to worry about,

505
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,122
nothing that I owe or need to be indebted for.

506
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:33,522
From now on

507
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,482
I hope you live a good life, Toon.

508
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:54,882
Good job.

509
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:59,002
Just take medicine, then it’ll be done

510
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:04,402
Why are you so kind to me?

511
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,202
I’ve treated you like this, aren’t you angry?

512
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,322
Listen!

513
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:14,322
I'm not like this with everyone,

514
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:19,962
if that person...

515
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,002
isn’t you.

516
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:27,922
Just let go, little one.

517
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,122
Stop forcing it and let things happen naturally.

518
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,162
Life is short.

519
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:33,722
Opportunities come,

520
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:36,522
but they might pass, and you can’t go back to fix them.

521
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:39,402
Heart disease isn’t hard to cure

522
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:41,722
just follow your heart.

523
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:54,322
Are you scared?

524
00:38:58,282 --> 00:38:59,082
You don’t have to be scared.

525
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:13,762
Don’t worry, I’m right here.

526
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,602
Can you stay with me tonight?

527
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:50,762
The porridge has been delivered.
