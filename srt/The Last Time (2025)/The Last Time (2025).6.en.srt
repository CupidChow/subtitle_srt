1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Run

2
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,720
Run

3
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,760
I cooked for you. Why aren't you eating?

4
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,200
It's already late.

5
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,960
Run

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,560
Run!

7
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,280
Hey!

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,680
Run

9
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
What’s wrong with you?

10
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,320
You're burning up!

11
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,800
Ken! Ken!

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,280
Ken!

13
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,600
Ken!

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
What’s wrong with you, Anna?

15
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm about to shower and sleep.

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Ken!

17
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,040
I don't know what's wrong with her.

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,840
What?

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
I don’t know!

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,920
She’s burning up!

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,760
Anna let bring her to hospital.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,560
Okay! Go!

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,440
Run!

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,640
Run!

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,680
Run!

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,680
Run!

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,960
Run, please be okay!

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,600
Run!

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,480
Run!

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Run!

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Run!

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Run!

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,280
Run!

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,880
Run!

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,960
Relatives of the patient must wait outside.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
You cannot enter.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,800
Ken, is she going to be fine?

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,280
It's my fault... I didn’t take good care of her.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,560
if something happens to her, how will you tell Ryu?

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Calm down.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,280
Calm down, Anna!

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
For now, let the patient get plenty of rest.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Thank you.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Lucky

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,360
that she isn't got seriously hurt.

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Ken< what should we do now?

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I think,

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
we have to tell Ryu.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,840
If got anything to Run,

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,720
We both can’t handle it.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,840
I’ll call and tell him.

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Stay out of it.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,600
And you don’t need to take responsibility for my life either.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
What ever happens to me,

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,800
This has nothing to do with Ryu.

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,640
Run!

57
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Speak to him nicely!

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,880
It's okay, Anna.

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
I don’t mind.

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
Yeah, Ken.

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,000
You can wait for me outside.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,960
I'll handle things inside.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,760
Yeah.

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,520
Call me if you need anything.

65
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,960
Hey!

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,880
I told you not to get up yet!

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,240
I was just getting up to grab some water.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm thirsty! Do you want me to die of thirst here or what?

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
Why don’t you tell me?

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
I’m getting for you.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,080
Here.

72
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
So stubborn.

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Get some rest now.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Anna...

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
I’m sorry.

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you saying?

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,360
I said “Sorry”.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Why should you apologized?

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
You did nothing wrong.

80
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,920
Do you really not feel anything to me?

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,080
I think people who love each other...

82
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,800
sometimes, there's no need to define the relationship.

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
What are we to each other?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,960
As long as we're happy together.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,840
I think this is already the best it can be.

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,400
I know that Run wants love to fill the missing piece.

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
I want to fill that space for you too.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm ready to be a sister to you, Run.

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
Get some rest now, Run.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,560
I'll go talk to Kan outside for a bit.

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,360
Okay.

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Sigh...

93
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
Boss

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,760
Come to think of it, love is pretty strange.

95
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,280
How?

96
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,360
Look at Eak and Pee.

97
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,720
Those two like each other.

98
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
But why can't they be open about it?

99
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,000
It's modern times, boss.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,960
No matter the gender, love is love, right?

101
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Why it’s not not me?

102
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
Why?

103
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,840
If it were you, what would you do?

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,000
If it me,

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,480
I’d announce it to the whole world!

106
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,600
That I have a partner!

107
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
And why are you telling me this?

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,440
Look me boss.

109
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
How can someone this handsome not have a partner?

110
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Jeez.

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
You narcissist!

112
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,560
It’s called

113
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
accepting the truth, boss.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,480
Don't forget to do the exercises the teacher assigned!

115
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,880
And if anyone doesn’t understand something,

116
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,160
you can message me.

117
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
Okay, teacher!

118
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,120
Make sure to focus on the exercises I assigned.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Pim, Who is picking you up to day?

120
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,280
My dad coming to pick me up.

121
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,240
And he will bring me to the shopping mall.

122
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,600
To get a new phone.

123
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
He told me that,

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,320
If I get a good score on the exam,

125
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,800
Dad will buy me a phone.

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
Last time you got iPad,

127
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,160
This time, you got a phone!

128
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,200
Your dad is so kind!

129
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,960
I’ve asked my dad so many times, but I still haven’t gotten one.

130
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,280
You should focus on studying like Pim.

131
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
So your dad going to buy one for you.

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Teacher, my dad is here to pick me up.

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,080
I’m leaving now. Goodbye!

134
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,160
And who’s picking up Nook and Nick?

135
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Mother.

136
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,680
There she are, right on time! Never late.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,520
Hello, teacher!

138
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,360
Hello!

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Were they being stubborn?

140
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
If they’re naughty, feel free to handle it.

141
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,640
They weren’t at all!

142
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Both of them are very focused on their studies.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,080
Are you hungry?

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
I’m so hungry! I feel like I’m starving!

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,560
It’s okay!

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,400
I bought your favorite grilled pork with sticky rice and soy milk.

147
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,160
It’s waiting in the car

148
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,360
let’s go eat!

149
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Hey, Run!

150
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
Isn't your mom picking you up, dear?

151
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Her parents aren’t coming to pick her up.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,440
I heard that both of her parents have passed away.

153
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,800
I’m heading home now.

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,600
Goodbye.

155
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,440
Do you really not feel anything with me?

156
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,442
look ate this it will male you smile!

157
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:16,442
this is not a true story

158
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,242
That’s very good, so fun.

159
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:36,082
Run, this is my friend, Tan.

160
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:40,322
Hello

161
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:42,842
Hi

162
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,762
He will be here for a few days.

163
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:48,842
I already tell Ryu.

164
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:49,762
He don’t mine.

165
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:53,242
You don’t have to tell me,

166
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,402
because this house wasn’t mine.

167
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,282
Who come or go

168
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:00,242
don’t have to tell me.

169
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:07,882
Why don’t you text me what you want?

170
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:13,682
just got cut by a glass, not disabled.

171
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,922
If I ever end up disabled or bedridden,

172
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,282
I’ll be sure to let you know right away.

173
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:21,642
Go ahead and stay with your friends.

174
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:35,042
Um...

175
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:36,922
By the way,

176
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:39,882
where he sleeping?

177
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,682
My room.

178
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,082
Ew, disgusting!

179
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:03,802
I’m going.

180
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:18,882
If staying over at your place is this much of a hassle...

181
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,042
It's okay, never mind.

182
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,922
No worries, I told Ryu.

183
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,482
He know you.

184
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,282
He even said it's a good thing

185
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:29,762
at least there’ll be a guy around.

186
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:33,122
Ryu has no problem with it,

187
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:34,682
but the one who does...

188
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:48,442
Everyone!

189
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,682
Today we have a new member.

190
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:52,762
Two people—Aek and Pee.

191
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,402
Today we’re celebrating!

192
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,002
No drunk, no going home,

193
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,722
no sleep, no rest!

194
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:00,162
Woohoo, hey!

195
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:05,162
Cheers!

196
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:10,202
So fresh!

197
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:12,682
Here!

198
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:16,962
Who want to drink with me, right?

199
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:22,002
It’s us!

200
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:26,922
Refreshing!

201
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,242
Cheers!

202
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:40,682
What wrong with this two?

203
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,082
Why are they being so tense with each other?

204
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:46,882
Making faces like sour soup with foam, just like you, boss.

205
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,202
I’m asking a wrong preson.

206
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:56,482
This guy’s face is all stiff, looks like a crow.

207
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,042
What did you said?

208
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,522
Nothing boss...

209
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:07,882
I’m going to say “ Cheers, Din!”

210
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,842
Pee and Eak, let’s cheers?

211
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,282
Cheers!

212
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:19,402
If you’re not that willing, then you don’t have to cheers.

213
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:21,162
Mangkorn. Your throat must be dry too.

214
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,242
What the hell wrong with you?

215
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,642
Since the morning!

216
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:25,482
What you want?

217
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:32,882
What do you want? I'm asking seriously.

218
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,642
Don’t you feel like you're being selfish?

219
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:44,242
Uh, calm down.

220
00:16:44,242 --> 00:16:45,762
Let’s talk slowly.

221
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:47,842
That right.

222
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:50,242
I think we should have some fun.

223
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:50,962
Right, Mangkorn?

224
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:52,522
Yeah, let’s have some fun.

225
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,042
But i’m not.

226
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,442
I don’t like selfish people.

227
00:16:58,122 --> 00:16:59,442
Speak nicely, Pee!

228
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:08,802
You should know yourself.

229
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,402
You are so damn stupid!

230
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:12,202
Stop it!

231
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:26,842
You are so...

232
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,522
Sorry everyone.

233
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:43,282
Boss.

234
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:46,082
Boss.

235
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,442
What should we do with this two?

236
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,042
Aren’t you afraid of people seeing you do this?

237
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:27,322
You're not afraid of them finding out what we are to each other?

238
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,242
See!?

239
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:06,602
In the end, you only care about yourself.

240
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,802
Pee, You have to understand me.

241
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,242
I’m not ready to tell anyone.

242
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,122
Another thing,

243
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:23,442
I'm not even sure if I like guys or girls.

244
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:28,522
So all this time, I’ve just been a test for you, huh?

245
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:31,242
To be honest, do you like girls or guys?

246
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,162
It’s not what you think, Pee.

247
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,242
Don't act like this, seriously.

248
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,042
You were never like this before, man.

249
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:40,442
I’ve always been like this for a long time.

250
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:42,562
So, what do you want me to understand?

251
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:44,762
If talking to me makes you feel good,

252
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,602
then just be with me.

253
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,522
But why?

254
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,922
So, are you deciding to stop dealing with me like this?

255
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:52,802
What about the feelings I’ve given you?

256
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,482
Who’s going to take responsibility?

257
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,882
You’re so damn selfish!

258
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,522
So what do you want me to do?

259
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,642
What do you need?

260
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:02,282
If you want me to do something, just tell me!

261
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:04,642
You don’t have to do anything,

262
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,482
and I don’t want anything either.

263
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:09,282
From now on, you go live your life,

264
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:11,002
and I’ll live mine.

265
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,202
Then go reflect on yourself,

266
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,202
figure out what you really want,

267
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:16,722
and come back to tell me.

268
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,402
But I can't promise I’ll wait.

269
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:30,682
Stop being so childish!

270
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:31,922
It’s just something small.

271
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:33,442
We are not kids!

272
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:48,402
I still like you. I feel good with you,

273
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:57,562
it's just that I’m not sure about my own feelings.

274
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:22,722
Eak.

275
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:25,642
Clam down first.

276
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:28,442
Don’t worry, when P'Pee is in a good mood,

277
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:30,602
he’ll come and apologize to you.

278
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,042
Ryu.

279
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:45,562
I can kind of see where our relationship stands.

280
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:52,722
But I didn't ask because I felt that when you're ready,

281
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:55,242
you'd tell me yourself.

282
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:59,162
And what do we really want?

283
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:07,802
I don't know what Pee is thinking. What is he angry at me for?

284
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:14,482
Since that day, Pee has completely changed, like night and day.

285
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:23,002
I just need clarity, that's all

286
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:27,202
What does clarity mean to you?

287
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:31,002
Just

288
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,242
Tell everyone that we’re dating

289
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:36,322
it have to be all hidden like this.

290
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,802
I’m just not confident in myself.

291
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,242
What do you want me to do?

292
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:42,442
I’ve never been in this situation before.

293
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:48,722
Right now,

294
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,482
I feel like I’m stuck at a crossroads.

295
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:56,002
I don’t know which way I will go.

296
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:00,842
I’m confuse.

297
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,642
And if Ek comes out in the open about it,

298
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:08,482
will that make you happier?

299
00:23:12,242 --> 00:23:13,042
I don’t know.

300
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:20,162
Then let me ask you this

301
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:22,602
Does he love you?

302
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,042
I can’t even answer that.

303
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:32,322
But

304
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:34,202
every time when we were together,

305
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:36,402
Ek really takes care of me,

306
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,042
like...

307
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:41,922
someone who truly cares…

308
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:45,082
Okay

309
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:46,602
then

310
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:48,642
I’m asking you a last question.

311
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:53,402
Do you love him?

312
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:58,602
Love these days is so hard to understand, bro.

313
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,242
is so hard to understand, bro.

314
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,002
You can't judge just by their actions alone.

315
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:12,322
But I think

316
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:15,442
you should try talking with your heart.

317
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:26,002
If you feel good doing something,

318
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:28,442
being with someone, and it makes you happy,

319
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:31,722
I think that's...

320
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:33,682
what they call love.

321
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:47,282
You don't have to answer me,

322
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,082
but if you keep thinking about these things

323
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:53,642
and caring about what the whole world thinks,

324
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:58,042
you'll be the one suffering, Pee.

325
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:00,442
Besides feeling hurt,

326
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:02,722
you might also lose Ek.

327
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:10,322
Sometimes, the true happiness of loving someone

328
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:14,122
isn’t about whether others accept it or not.

329
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:19,082
But the true happiness of loving someone is simply being able to love them

330
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:22,882
today, tomorrow,

331
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:25,682
or even after we're no longer in this world.

332
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:30,002
As long as we love someone

333
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,642
and have someone who loves us in return,

334
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:35,522
maybe

335
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:38,242
what we want...

336
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:41,842
that's all love really needs.

337
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:43,607
Mon

338
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,047
I’m missing you.

339
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,407
Boiled vegetables again and again...

340
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,327
I've eaten so much that I might as well be a vegetable now.

341
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,927
Just eat it.

342
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,527
Having something to eat is good enough.

343
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,207
Eat more boiled vegetables,

344
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:01,327
so you can be slim like me.

345
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:15,487
Today, there's grilled chicken too!

346
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,887
Whose favorite is this?

347
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,367
Me!

348
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:29,727
Run

349
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:31,327
Where is Run?

350
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:32,807
Is P'Run not coming to eat?

351
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,007
You go call her to have diner.

352
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:43,407
Oh wow, me again, huh?

353
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,087
Run, uncle  Ith is calling you for dinner.

354
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:13,647
I’m not eating,

355
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,127
I’m not hungry.

356
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,607
But today, there’s grilled chicken too. Smells so good!

357
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:22,247
We don’t get to eat this often!

358
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:23,687
Let’s go eat.

359
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:26,567
We've been eating boiled eggs and omelets so much

360
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,287
that our faces might turn into eggs!

361
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:33,647
Don’t you go to eat?

362
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:36,687
I’m not eating.

363
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:38,207
I’m full.

364
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:40,887
Go ahead and eat!

365
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:43,407
Up to you then,

366
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,087
I’ll go tell Uncle Ith then!

367
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:55,207
Little girl.

368
00:30:57,367 --> 00:31:00,247
Do you know where the house of the person named Ith is?

369
00:31:01,447 --> 00:31:03,487
Oh, that's my house! Why do you ask?

370
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:05,807
I’m looking for someone named Ith.

371
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:06,807
Could you take me there?

372
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:09,207
Alright! It’s just a little further.

373
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,367
I’ll take you there.

374
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,287
Uncle Ith! Uncle Ith! Someone's here to see you!

375
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:27,007
Hello uncle Ith.

376
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:28,647
Hi Mr. Ryu

377
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,407
Thank you for coming to see me.

378
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:39,407
Are you Rin's younger brother?

379
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,807
Did you ask me to come here for something?

380
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,607
You never knew, did you?

381
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,247
That you have a younger sister…

382
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:16,207
my sister passed away.

383
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:18,607
I took Ran in and raised her.

384
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:21,007
At first,

385
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:22,967
I was able to take care of her.

386
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:25,607
But now I'm starting to get sick,

387
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:28,207
and all my burdens have increased.

388
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:35,807
All the income comes from the eldest niece who earns it.

389
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,847
Right now, we're in a really bad situation.

390
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:44,807
What I could help you?

391
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:47,647
When Rin was alive,

392
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:50,207
she was very kind to me.

393
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:54,847
Before my sister passed away,

394
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:58,007
she told me

395
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:02,207
that if I ever had any problems, I should call you.

396
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:05,607
Um...

397
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,407
I would like to ask if...

398
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,847
you could take care of Ran for me.

399
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:16,847
I think

400
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:20,767
I probably won’t be around much longer.

401
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:35,007
Sure.

402
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:37,007
No matter what,

403
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,567
Ran is still my younger sister.

404
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:46,047
I’m not going.

405
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:48,487
I want to stay with uncle.

406
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:51,007
with Chang,

407
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:53,967
And younger sister.

408
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,007
Run

409
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:04,607
Go live with him, okay?

410
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:11,367
I’m not going!

411
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,447
I said I don’t want to go!

412
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:45,367
Run

413
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:48,287
I think you…

414
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,007
It’s better if you go stay with Ryu.

415
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:54,287
No, Chang.

416
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,167
I don’t want to go.

417
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,047
I'm already happy here.

418
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:03,767
Why do I have to leave?

419
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:08,567
Skipping meals,

420
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:10,367
and going hungry.

421
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:13,167
No access to books or education.

422
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:15,207
This is what you call happiness?

423
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:19,407
Even if I have to skip meals

424
00:35:20,847 --> 00:35:22,887
, I still get to be with my brothers and sisters.

425
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:26,647
Isn't that happiness enough?

426
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:30,887
Chang.

427
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,567
Please don’t kick me out.

428
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:44,767
Run

429
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:47,247
I'm not kicking you out.

430
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:50,527
I understanding you.

431
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:53,807
But if you...

432
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:56,487
going with Ryu.

433
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,247
You'll get to study,

434
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:01,847
have money,

435
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,407
and live a better life than staying here.

436
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:12,527
I don't want to see your future

437
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,487
end up like mine.

438
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:25,847
Think about it.

439
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:30,567
if you’re mom were looking down from the sky,

440
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,087
how happy would she be?

441
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:37,407
If seeing you

442
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,167
Having a future.

443
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:47,847
Run

444
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,047
Run, come stay with me.

445
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:55,687
I'll take care of you.

446
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,007
Run

447
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:21,007
Run

448
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:22,767
Run

449
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:26,727
Run, I made food for you. Why aren't you eating?

450
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:28,167
It's already late.

451
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:38,807
Run

452
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:46,447
Run!

453
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:48,207
No...

454
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:49,967
Run!

455
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,407
What’s wrong with you?

456
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:56,207
Ken! Ken! Ken!

457
00:37:58,087 --> 00:37:58,967
Run!

458
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,287
Run!

459
00:38:03,087 --> 00:38:03,887
Run!

460
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:05,287
Run!

461
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:07,207
Run!

462
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:11,647
Run!

463
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,847
The patient's relatives must wait outside. You are not allowed to enter.

464
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:18,927
Ken!

465
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:20,847
Is she going to be fine?

466
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,367
It’s my fault. I didn’t take good care of her.

467
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:25,727
If anything go wrong with Run...

468
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:26,167
Clam down.

469
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:27,607
How I’m going to tell Ryu?

470
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:28,047
Clam down.

471
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:29,247
But Run...

472
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:30,247
Clam down, Anna!

473
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:33,407
You need to calm down.
