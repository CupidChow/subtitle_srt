1
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,040
How are you going to explain this?

2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,320
I didn’t do it, President.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,200
I don’t know anything.

4
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,280
Someone is framing me.

5
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Toon!

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,600
If you did something wrong,

7
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,560
then take responsibility for it.

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,760
All the money that transferred from the company

9
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,600
I've checked

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,560
it went into your account.

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
This was your plan all along, wasn't it, Ryu?

12
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,840
You just want me gone.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
So you framed me.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
Excuse me.

15
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,600
Officer, please take care of this.

16
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,360
I’m going to see this through to the very end.

17
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,200
Please come to the station to give your statement.

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,920
Ryu!

19
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,720
Remember it,

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,200
If I make it out of this,

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,560
I’ll come after you.

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Just you wait and see.

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,560
Hand off me!

24
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Ryu, remember this. I’m going to kill you.

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Hand off me!

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,400
Ryu!

27
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
Arrest him! Arrest him!

28
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
Toon!

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think Ryu...

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Stay out of this, Tin!

31
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,680
I don’t see anyone here, boss.

32
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,400
Hey!

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,720
They are here!

34
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,880
How was it? Was the journey difficult?

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
Must be exhausting.

36
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,520
It’s nothing, brother.

37
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,920
I’ve been through tougher than this.

38
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720
This is chill.

39
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
You're talking big now,

40
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,080
but I saw you complaining about motion sickness, saying you didn’t want to come.

41
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Wow, who could be as skilled as you?

42
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,880
You’re talking about me,

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but you were vomiting the whole way here.

44
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,160
Did I even have to see your face?

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,960
It might have been better if I hadn’t.

46
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
And do you think I want to see your face?

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,520
Guy! guy!

48
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
Clam down first.

49
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,960
Let’s go get something cold to drink,

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,800
so we can cool off.

51
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
I'm calm already,

52
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
I don't really want to cause trouble with someone like that,

53
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,720
but they always try to take credit for everything,

54
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,320
even simple things.

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,840
What do you really want?"

56
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,280
He don’t even know it.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,640
If the president didn't order this,

58
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,320
I wouldn't have come.

59
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,040
Just so you know.

60
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,360
You think I actually wanted to come with you?

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
Hey, Pee!

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,200
Come back and talk to me when you can make sense.

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Pee!

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,080
Boss

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,240
I don’t think this is normal.

66
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,960
Who told you that?

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,960
If they are not fighting, that's unusual.

68
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,400
Wait for me boss!

69
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,640
Where are they gone?

70
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Why are you like this?

71
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Can you stop being so childish already?

72
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Oh there!

73
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
they're yelling at each other in the market.

74
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,840
just tell me what you want!

75
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,520
Coming to work like this...

76
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,040
I shouldn't have come at all.

77
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,520
And you think I wanted to come with you?

78
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,280
If the director didn’t order it, I wouldn’t have come.

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
And you ask me what I want.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
If I tell you, will you be able to do it?

81
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,720
Just tell me now!

82
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,760
If you don't tell me, how would I know what I can do to help you?

83
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
Tell me first! Hey,

84
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,600
what’s going on?

85
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Nothing.

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
The dog just barking.

87
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,880
Ryu!

88
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,480
Here you are! I tried calling, but couldn't get through.

89
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,120
This is Pee and Eak.

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,040
This is Mangkorn

91
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,280
and Din.

92
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,520
The person who's going to help us with the project,

93
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,080
please make sure to assist us.

94
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
I think you guys must be tired.

95
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,240
Let me take you to your accommodation first.

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Let’s go!

97
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Brother,

98
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,760
Do these two have something going on?

99
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,840
Please don't say I'm being difficult.

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,720
If these two have issues,

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,960
I think our work will be in trouble.

102
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,720
If it's too much, we still have to handle it.

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,480
Hello boss.

104
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you doing good?

105
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,880
I’m fine.

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
How about you?

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,600
Long time no see! Are we doing well?

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
Me?

109
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
How do you think?

110
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Maybe?

111
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
Probably not as much as the boss,

112
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,320
sitting in the air-conditioned office all day.

113
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,200
Hey, Toon.

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,440
Clam down!

115
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,840
I’m telling the truth!

116
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,680
I must be thank to you,

117
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Who has been teaching me the job so well.

118
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,800
I remember, I’ve never forgotten, what you’ve done for me.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
Boss, you sure have a lot of tasks for me, huh?

120
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,640
By the way, does the boss know who they are?

121
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,680
The world is small, isn't it? These two know each other.

122
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,360
Well then,

123
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,400
we'll take our leave now.

124
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
Excuse us.

125
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Excuse us.

126
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,280
I think you should stop holding a grudge against him and move on.

127
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,200
Don't you remember?

128
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
what does he did to me?

129
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,280
One day... No, I think it has to end with his death

130
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,120
before I'll let it go.

131
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,680
How many times do I have to talk to you about this before

132
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
you actually get it?

133
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
If you cause trouble again this time,

134
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,000
me and Mom won't be able to help you anymore.

135
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,680
Finally here!

136
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,080
I thought you were already on your way to the South of Thailand!

137
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,320
You’ve just arrived and already complaining.

138
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,600
I rarely come to Bangkok,

139
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,560
can’t you understand me a little?

140
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,200
By the way,

141
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Is this Bangkok or hell?

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah!

143
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,840
If I stand here for another ten minutes,

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
my skin will definitely burn like charcoal!

145
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,640
Oh daring!

146
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,200
don’t for get my bag.

147
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,000
Crazy Tan!

148
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,640
By the way

149
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,560
How long you are staying in Thailand?

150
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
I still don’t know. I haven’t finished clearing up everything yet."

151
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,200
Maybe for a while.

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,440
So what about the past two or three days I've been here?

153
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,680
You told Ryu for me, right?

154
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,800
I did, Ryu don’t mind,

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
If you hadn’t stolen from his house...

156
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,960
Sis,

157
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,360
I’ve quit having that kind of attitude already, haha!

158
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Hey!

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
Are you still using that dating app or whatever?

160
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,640
Don’t you remember?

161
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
I've had my heart broken so many times, cried so many times.

162
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,400
So, who are you dating this time?

163
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,160
I’m single.

164
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,840
If you weren’t single, would you still be using a dating app?

165
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,520
Someone like you, single?

166
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,360
No way, I don’t believe it!

167
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,720
You really are exactly like my friend, huh?

168
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,000
Right now, I’m talking to this one girl,

169
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,280
but her house is so far away.

170
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
We'll meet in the next two or three days.

171
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah, just make sure to be careful about who you date.

172
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,720
Don’t make me have to listen to you crying again.

173
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Yeah!

174
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,160
I swear this time,

175
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,400
you’re definitely not getting a punishment.

176
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
By the way,

177
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,120
I heard that

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,640
My friend like to eat grass or something?

179
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,280
That news spreads fast!

180
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,360
Did you get it from the CCTV footage or what?

181
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,600
No.

182
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,160
I don’t know,

183
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,680
but what I do know is, right now,

184
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,080
Your face is all red,

185
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,120
hey Ken!

186
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,320
What are you talking about? Come back here right now!

187
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,960
Who go a red face?

188
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Ken!

189
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,040
Crazy!

190
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,720
Who go a red face?

191
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,259
look ate this it will male you smile!

192
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,259
this is not a true story

193
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,059
That’s very good, so fun.

194
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,899
Run, this is my friend, Tan.

195
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,139
Hello

196
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:45,659
Hi

197
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,579
He will be here for a few days.

198
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,659
I already tell Ryu.

199
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,579
He don’t mine.

200
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,059
You don’t have to tell me,

201
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,219
because this house wasn’t mine.

202
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,099
Who come or go

203
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,059
don’t have to tell me.

204
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,699
Why don’t you text me what you want?

205
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,499
just got cut by a glass, not disabled.

206
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,739
If I ever end up disabled or bedridden,

207
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,099
I’ll be sure to let you know right away.

208
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,459
Go ahead and stay with your friends.

209
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:37,859
Um...

210
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:39,739
By the way,

211
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,699
where he sleeping?

212
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:47,499
My room.

213
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:49,899
Ew, disgusting!

214
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:06,619
I’m going.

215
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,699
If staying over at your place is this much of a hassle...

216
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:23,859
It's okay, never mind.

217
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,739
No worries, I told Ryu.

218
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,299
He know you.

219
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,099
He even said it's a good thing

220
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:32,579
at least there’ll be a guy around.

221
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,939
Ryu has no problem with it,

222
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,499
but the one who does...

223
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,259
Everyone!

224
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,499
Today we have a new member.

225
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,579
Two people—Aek and Pee.

226
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,219
Today we’re celebrating!

227
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,819
No drunk, no going home,

228
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,539
no sleep, no rest!

229
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:02,979
Woohoo, hey!

230
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:07,979
Cheers!

231
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,019
So fresh!

232
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,499
Here!

233
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:19,779
Who want to drink with me, right?

234
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,819
It’s us!

235
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,739
Refreshing!

236
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,059
Cheers!

237
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,499
What wrong with this two?

238
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,899
Why are they being so tense with each other?

239
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,699
Making faces like sour soup with foam, just like you, boss.

240
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:56,019
I’m asking a wrong preson.

241
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,299
This guy’s face is all stiff, looks like a crow.

242
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:04,859
What did you said?

243
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:06,339
Nothing boss...

244
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,699
I’m going to say “ Cheers, Din!”

245
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,659
Pee and Eak, let’s cheers?

246
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,099
Cheers!

247
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,219
If you’re not that willing, then you don’t have to cheers.

248
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:23,979
Mangkorn. Your throat must be dry too.

249
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,059
What the hell wrong with you?

250
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:27,459
Since the morning!

251
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:28,299
What you want?

252
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,699
What do you want? I'm asking seriously.

253
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,459
Don’t you feel like you're being selfish?

254
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:47,059
Uh, calm down.

255
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,579
Let’s talk slowly.

256
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:50,659
That right.

257
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,059
I think we should have some fun.

258
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:53,779
Right, Mangkorn?

259
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,339
Yeah, let’s have some fun.

260
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:56,859
But i’m not.

261
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:00,259
I don’t like selfish people.

262
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,259
Speak nicely, Pee!

263
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,619
You should know yourself.

264
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,219
You are so damn stupid!

265
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,019
Stop it!

266
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:29,659
You are so...

267
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,339
Sorry everyone.

268
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,099
Boss.

269
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:48,899
Boss.

270
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,259
What should we do with this two?

271
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,859
Aren’t you afraid of people seeing you do this?

272
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:30,139
You're not afraid of them finding out what we are to each other?

273
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,059
See!?

274
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,419
In the end, you only care about yourself.

275
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,619
Pee, You have to understand me.

276
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,059
I’m not ready to tell anyone.

277
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:23,939
Another thing,

278
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,259
I'm not even sure if I like guys or girls.

279
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:31,339
So all this time, I’ve just been a test for you, huh?

280
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,059
To be honest, do you like girls or guys?

281
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,979
It’s not what you think, Pee.

282
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,059
Don't act like this, seriously.

283
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,859
You were never like this before, man.

284
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:43,259
I’ve always been like this for a long time.

285
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,379
So, what do you want me to understand?

286
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,579
If talking to me makes you feel good,

287
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,419
then just be with me.

288
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,339
But why?

289
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:52,739
So, are you deciding to stop dealing with me like this?

290
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,619
What about the feelings I’ve given you?

291
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,299
Who’s going to take responsibility?

292
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,699
You’re so damn selfish!

293
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,339
So what do you want me to do?

294
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,459
What do you need?

295
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,099
If you want me to do something, just tell me!

296
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,459
You don’t have to do anything,

297
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,299
and I don’t want anything either.

298
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,099
From now on, you go live your life,

299
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,819
and I’ll live mine.

300
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,019
Then go reflect on yourself,

301
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,019
figure out what you really want,

302
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,539
and come back to tell me.

303
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,219
But I can't promise I’ll wait.

304
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,499
Stop being so childish!

305
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,739
It’s just something small.

306
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:36,259
We are not kids!

307
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:51,219
I still like you. I feel good with you,

308
00:22:53,499 --> 00:23:00,379
it's just that I’m not sure about my own feelings.

309
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,539
Eak.

310
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:28,459
Clam down first.

311
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:31,259
Don’t worry, when P'Pee is in a good mood,

312
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:33,419
he’ll come and apologize to you.

313
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:39,859
Ryu.

314
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:48,379
I can kind of see where our relationship stands.

315
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:55,539
But I didn't ask because I felt that when you're ready,

316
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:58,059
you'd tell me yourself.

317
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,979
And what do we really want?

318
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:10,619
I don't know what Pee is thinking. What is he angry at me for?

319
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:17,299
Since that day, Pee has completely changed, like night and day.

320
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,819
I just need clarity, that's all

321
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,019
What does clarity mean to you?

322
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:33,819
Just

323
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:37,059
Tell everyone that we’re dating

324
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:39,139
it have to be all hidden like this.

325
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:41,619
I’m just not confident in myself.

326
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:44,059
What do you want me to do?

327
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,259
I’ve never been in this situation before.

328
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,539
Right now,

329
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,299
I feel like I’m stuck at a crossroads.

330
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:58,819
I don’t know which way I will go.

331
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:03,659
I’m confuse.

332
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:07,459
And if Ek comes out in the open about it,

333
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:11,299
will that make you happier?

334
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:15,859
I don’t know.

335
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,979
Then let me ask you this

336
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:25,419
Does he love you?

337
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:31,859
I can’t even answer that.

338
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,139
But

339
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,019
every time when we were together,

340
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,219
Ek really takes care of me,

341
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:41,859
like...

342
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,739
someone who truly cares…

343
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:47,899
Okay

344
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:49,419
then

345
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,459
I’m asking you a last question.

346
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:56,219
Do you love him?

347
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:01,419
Love these days is so hard to understand, bro.

348
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,059
is so hard to understand, bro.

349
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,819
You can't judge just by their actions alone.

350
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,139
But I think

351
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,259
you should try talking with your heart.

352
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:28,819
If you feel good doing something,

353
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,259
being with someone, and it makes you happy,

354
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:34,539
I think that's...

355
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:36,499
what they call love.

356
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,099
You don't have to answer me,

357
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:53,899
but if you keep thinking about these things

358
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:56,459
and caring about what the whole world thinks,

359
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:00,859
you'll be the one suffering, Pee.

360
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:03,259
Besides feeling hurt,

361
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:05,539
you might also lose Ek.

362
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:13,139
Sometimes, the true happiness of loving someone

363
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:16,939
isn’t about whether others accept it or not.

364
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,899
But the true happiness of loving someone is simply being able to love them

365
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,699
today, tomorrow,

366
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,499
or even after we're no longer in this world.

367
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:32,819
As long as we love someone

368
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:35,459
and have someone who loves us in return,

369
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:38,339
maybe

370
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,059
what we want...

371
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:44,659
that's all love really needs.

372
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,425
Mon

373
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,865
I’m missing you.

374
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,225
Boiled vegetables again and again...

375
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:57,145
I've eaten so much that I might as well be a vegetable now.

376
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,745
Just eat it.

377
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:01,345
Having something to eat is good enough.

378
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:03,025
Eat more boiled vegetables,

379
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:04,145
so you can be slim like me.

380
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:18,305
Today, there's grilled chicken too!

381
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,705
Whose favorite is this?

382
00:30:22,225 --> 00:30:23,185
Me!

383
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:32,545
Run

384
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,145
Where is Run?

385
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:35,625
Is P'Run not coming to eat?

386
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,825
You go call her to have diner.

387
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,225
Oh wow, me again, huh?

388
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:14,905
Run, uncle  Ith is calling you for dinner.

389
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:16,465
I’m not eating,

390
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:17,945
I’m not hungry.

391
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:22,425
But today, there’s grilled chicken too. Smells so good!

392
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:25,065
We don’t get to eat this often!

393
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:26,505
Let’s go eat.

394
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,385
We've been eating boiled eggs and omelets so much

395
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:31,105
that our faces might turn into eggs!

396
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:36,465
Don’t you go to eat?

397
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:39,505
I’m not eating.

398
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,025
I’m full.

399
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,705
Go ahead and eat!

400
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,225
Up to you then,

401
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,905
I’ll go tell Uncle Ith then!

402
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,025
Little girl.

403
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:03,065
Do you know where the house of the person named Ith is?

404
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:06,305
Oh, that's my house! Why do you ask?

405
00:33:06,705 --> 00:33:08,625
I’m looking for someone named Ith.

406
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,625
Could you take me there?

407
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:12,025
Alright! It’s just a little further.

408
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:14,185
I’ll take you there.

409
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:25,105
Uncle Ith! Uncle Ith! Someone's here to see you!

410
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:29,825
Hello uncle Ith.

411
00:33:30,665 --> 00:33:31,465
Hi Mr. Ryu

412
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:39,225
Thank you for coming to see me.

413
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,225
Are you Rin's younger brother?

414
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:48,625
Did you ask me to come here for something?

415
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,425
You never knew, did you?

416
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,065
That you have a younger sister…

417
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:19,025
my sister passed away.

418
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,425
I took Ran in and raised her.

419
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:23,825
At first,

420
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,785
I was able to take care of her.

421
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:28,425
But now I'm starting to get sick,

422
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,025
and all my burdens have increased.

423
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:38,625
All the income comes from the eldest niece who earns it.

424
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:43,665
Right now, we're in a really bad situation.

425
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:47,625
What I could help you?

426
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,465
When Rin was alive,

427
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:53,025
she was very kind to me.

428
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:57,665
Before my sister passed away,

429
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:00,825
she told me

430
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,025
that if I ever had any problems, I should call you.

431
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,425
Um...

432
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:12,225
I would like to ask if...

433
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,665
you could take care of Ran for me.

434
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,665
I think

435
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:23,585
I probably won’t be around much longer.

436
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:37,825
Sure.

437
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:39,825
No matter what,

438
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:43,385
Ran is still my younger sister.

439
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:48,865
I’m not going.

440
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:51,305
I want to stay with uncle.

441
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:53,825
with Chang,

442
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:56,785
And younger sister.

443
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:04,825
Run

444
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,425
Go live with him, okay?

445
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:14,185
I’m not going!

446
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:16,265
I said I don’t want to go!

447
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:48,185
Run

448
00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:51,105
I think you…

449
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:53,825
It’s better if you go stay with Ryu.

450
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:57,105
No, Chang.

451
00:36:58,705 --> 00:36:59,985
I don’t want to go.

452
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,865
I'm already happy here.

453
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,585
Why do I have to leave?

454
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:11,385
Skipping meals,

455
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:13,185
and going hungry.

456
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,985
No access to books or education.

457
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:18,025
This is what you call happiness?

458
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,225
Even if I have to skip meals

459
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:25,705
, I still get to be with my brothers and sisters.

460
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,465
Isn't that happiness enough?

461
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:33,705
Chang.

462
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:38,385
Please don’t kick me out.

463
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:47,585
Run

464
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:50,065
I'm not kicking you out.

465
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,345
I understanding you.

466
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:56,625
But if you...

467
00:37:58,505 --> 00:37:59,305
going with Ryu.

468
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:02,065
You'll get to study,

469
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:04,665
have money,

470
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:09,225
and live a better life than staying here.

471
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:15,345
I don't want to see your future

472
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:20,305
end up like mine.

473
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:28,665
Think about it.

474
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,385
if you’re mom were looking down from the sky,

475
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:36,905
how happy would she be?

476
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,225
If seeing you

477
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:41,985
Having a future.

478
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:50,665
Run

479
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:53,865
Run, come stay with me.

480
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,505
I'll take care of you.

481
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:16,825
Run

482
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:23,825
Run

483
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:25,585
Run

484
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,545
Run, I made food for you. Why aren't you eating?

485
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,985
It's already late.

486
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:41,625
Run

487
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:49,265
Run!

488
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:51,025
No...

489
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:52,785
Run!

490
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,225
What’s wrong with you?

491
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:59,025
Ken! Ken! Ken!

492
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:01,785
Run!

493
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:05,105
Run!

494
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:06,705
Run!

495
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,105
Run!

496
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:10,025
Run!

497
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:14,465
Run!

498
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:17,665
The patient's relatives must wait outside. You are not allowed to enter.

499
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:21,745
Ken!

500
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:23,665
Is she going to be fine?

501
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:27,185
It’s my fault. I didn’t take good care of her.

502
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:28,545
If anything go wrong with Run...

503
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:28,985
Clam down.

504
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,425
How I’m going to tell Ryu?

505
00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:30,865
Clam down.

506
00:40:31,425 --> 00:40:32,065
But Run...

507
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:33,065
Clam down, Anna!

508
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,225
You need to calm down.
