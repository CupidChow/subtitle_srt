1
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,200
I’m your brother!

2
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,960
Because it’s you!

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
That's why I dare to say it.

4
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,000
And Run still stands by their words.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,920
Having a lousy brother like this,

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,320
I'd rather have a dog as my brother.

7
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,120
Run!

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Pin

9
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Is this really you?

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,240
I'm not dreaming, right, Pin?

11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,480
Do you know that...

12
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,520
I can’t stay,

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,480
If I don’t have you.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
It’s well deserved.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,240
A Person right you,

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
It’s well deserved.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,880
You have to face the consequences of what you did to me.

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Why did you kill me?!

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
A Person right you, It’s well deserved.

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,880
You have to face the consequences of what you did to me.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
มึงฆ่ากูทําไม

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
Ryu!

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,960
today you are coming so early.

24
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,640
And,

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,080
The task I assigned to you, is it completed?

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Already completed.

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Hey!

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
Why press it so many times?

29
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,440
Pressing once is enough.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm not deaf.

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,520
Is Ryu here?

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
No, Is there anything?

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
Are you Run?

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,600
Haven’t see you for a long time.

35
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
You have grow up a lot!

36
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
I’m Anna, Can you remember?

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,240
Um, no!

38
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,280
The one who's Ryu's junior.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
I’ve been here since I’m in uni.

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,640
Then?

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,840
I said I can’t remember.

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,000
It’s hot out here, Bye!

43
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
Hey, Wait!

44
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,040
Didn’t Ryu told you that I will be here?

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,040
No.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Can you let me in and wait in side?

47
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
No!

48
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,680
So, you won’t let me in right?

49
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,120
I see!

50
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,560
Ryu!

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,000
Ryu!

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,600
Ryu!

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,240
Hey!

54
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,960
Why are you being so loud? People will end up scolding.

55
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,360
I said Ryu is not here, he out for work!

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
Then let me in,

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,800
So I can wait in side.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,640
No!

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200
I don’t know who you are.

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,720
You look just like a criminal.

61
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,880
If you're here to deceive me, then I'm doomed.

62
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,200
Get out!

63
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,320
Hey, wait!

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,760
I got his photo too!

65
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,240
I’m not stupid!

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
you can edit the photo!

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,000
A clip! I got a video with him too!

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
You can also edit the video,

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
People these days are hard to trust.

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,640
Go deceive someone else.

71
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,400
Not open right?

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,840
Hey, Let me in!

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,560
Ryu!

74
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,880
Let’s me in!

75
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,920
Run!

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,600
Run!

77
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
Come back!

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,960
What are you doing? You look just like a thief!

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,960
Stop it now!

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,640
Otherwise I will call the police.

81
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
Then Let’s me in.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,880
Ryu!

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Let’s me in Please!

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Hey, Run!

85
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
Come back, Run!

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Run!

87
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
Boss!

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,400
Can we start the meeting now?

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,240
I have another work to do.

90
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,080
Then,

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,080
I think we will start now.

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,920
Um, Sorry for let’s you guys waiting.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,680
So sorry, the traffic was so worst.

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
There's no sense of responsibility.

95
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,600
I scheduled an appointment with you at 8 AM.

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,200
you come at 9 AM.

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
Cool!

98
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,120
Everyone is waiting.

99
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Go sit!

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
It’s will be like this,

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,480
I got a new project

102
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,400
It is a presentation of tourism in Kanchanaburi Province.

103
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,240
But this time, it's not like every other time we've done it.

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,120
I have to work in another zone,

105
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,800
We're going to work on the Sangkhlaburi zone.

106
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
E-Tong and Pilok.

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,320
And this time, initially...

108
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,320
I will go check the location and gather information.

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
As for who will be responsible for what...

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,480
Can you explain it?

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,720
Sure!

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,000
But first,

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,440
I will have Arm and Ryu go down to survey the area together.

114
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,760
What?

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,080
Can you say it again?

116
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,360
Do I have to go with boss alone?

117
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,040
Yes!

118
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Seriously unlucky!

119
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Milk!

120
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,920
As for the budget, I’m entrusting you with this matter.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
We might process the budget request,

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,320
before Arm and Ryu arrive in Kanchanaburi.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,320
But in the meantime,

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,160
someone might join later, though I haven't decided who yet.

125
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,960
As for the information and coordination,

126
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,640
Eak and I will handle it with Arm and Ryu.

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Anyway, I’m counting on everyone to take care of the office.

128
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
When in not here.

129
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,680
As for who will be going with me...

130
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,920
Please don’t be late!

131
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,600
Uncle, I have something to talk to you about.

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,280
what is it about?

133
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,600
Don’t tell me that...

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,360
The matter of you going to Kanchanaburi with Ryu?

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
You don’t want to go?

136
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,600
You have to!

137
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
I’m not going!

138
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,000
You have to go!

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
I’m not going!

140
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
You have to!

141
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,080
Please listen to me clearly.

142
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,800
I’M NOT GOING!

143
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,880
If I go,

144
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,680
You can call a buffalo.

145
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,680
You're no different from your father.

146
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,960
You're irresponsible, just like your father.

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Okay!

148
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
I will go!

149
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,560
I will let you know,

150
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,320
that I different from my father.

151
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,240
Finally, you called back.

152
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,640
I've been in front of the house for an hour now.

153
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,600
She won't open the door. Can you call Run and tell them?

154
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,920
Okay, I’m so sorry

155
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,800
I was in a meeting and I turn-off my phone.

156
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,800
I will tell her now.

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Okay, brother.

158
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,160
Have you trust me now?

159
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
What the...

160
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,120
Hum...

161
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,240
You little troublemaker!

162
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,400
Is it here? the first room?

163
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,920
Okay!

164
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,920
I’m in I’m room mow

165
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Wow

166
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,480
this is good!

167
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
sure Ryu!

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,640
See you this evening, Thank you lots!

169
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
Fuck!

170
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,480
Fuck!

171
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,720
Why it happens today?

172
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
I didn’t  prepare for it.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,800
Run!

174
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,360
What’s up?

175
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,440
Do you have a sanitary pad?

176
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you have a sanitary pad?

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,960
What? I can’t hear it.

178
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,760
Do you have a sanitary pad?

179
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,400
Ouch!

180
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,400
Then why are you whispering?

181
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,400
Just say sanitary pad

182
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
Wait here, I will get it for you.

183
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,840
Thank you

184
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,560
I thought your period was over.

185
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:05,979
How are you, Arm?

186
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:10,499
Why are you asking me like that?

187
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,019
Nothing.

188
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,339
I’m just asking.

189
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,619
Why you have to be that mad?

190
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,299
How could I not be upset?

191
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,859
Because of that damn boss.

192
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,299
I was only a little late.

193
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,539
He scolded me like I had killed someone.

194
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,099
I'm seriously asking you.

195
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,419
What is he usually like?

196
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,299
Normally, Ryu doesn’t really socialize with anyone.

197
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,179
He acts hard to approach,

198
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,259
like he has something on his mind.

199
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,579
I heard that he's an alcoholic too.

200
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,419
His life just revolves around the office and the bar.

201
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,379
See! I know it.

202
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,979
I really wasn't wrong about him.

203
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,539
But he's a good person.

204
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,419
Also good at work.

205
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,339
I could say that he's the best in the office.

206
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,619
He cares for his subordinates and protects them.

207
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:09,579
But...

208
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:12,979
he's extremely serious about punctuality.

209
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,859
He doesn't really like people who are late.

210
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,619
Power-hungry lunatic...

211
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:21,539
What did you say?

212
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,459
Oh, nothing.

213
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:26,459
So he is a good person.

214
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,459
But his social skills are just a little lacking.

215
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,419
By the way, why do you ask?

216
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,459
Just asking, nothing special.

217
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,219
Oh yeah, I'm going to buy coffee.

218
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:42,059
Do you want to go together?

219
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:42,859
No, I’m...

220
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:43,899
This shop is delicious, Arm.

221
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:44,579
Trust me.

222
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,899
I don’t want.

223
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:46,859
This shop is delicious.

224
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:47,699
I have a coffee.

225
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:48,979
It’s delicious, Trust me.

226
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,339
Let’s go together.

227
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:51,539
Trust me!

228
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,419
No thank, I already got my coffee.

229
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,619
Hi Lisa.

230
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:15,979
Hi Eak.

231
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:17,699
Is he your new friend?

232
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,779
Yesterday he was here.

233
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,099
Oh, the president nephew?

234
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:28,899
Quite a big connection.

235
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,179
Like you think.

236
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:34,099
Arm

237
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:35,859
What you want to drink?

238
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,499
Just anything.

239
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,779
Something cold.

240
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,259
I'm irritated, bro.

241
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:43,819
Ah...

242
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,139
Is there anything he can drink to cool down his temper?

243
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,139
This is pretty serious.

244
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,899
I'll get you something strong.

245
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:52,859
Sounds good, let's go with that.

246
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,779
I'll have the same as usual.

247
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:56,339
Okay.

248
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,259
I will call you.

249
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:58,019
Thank you.

250
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:58,659
Your welcome.

251
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,499
Do you know what?

252
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,819
I'm still not over my anger yet.

253
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,859
Just because you're the boss, you think you can do whatever you want?

254
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,019
Damn it!

255
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,499
Don't let me run into him.

256
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,179
If I see him, I will...

257
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,699
Hi boss.

258
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,779
Are you buy a coffee?

259
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,939
It's almost time to start work.

260
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:33,699
Eak.

261
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,179
Please keep an eye on the new recruit for me

262
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,139
Don't be late for work again.

263
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:42,299
You're already grown up; no excuses.

264
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,659
Yes, boss.

265
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:46,459
No late for sure!

266
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:49,299
Lisa,

267
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,379
Same thing.

268
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,739
Black coffee.

269
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,499
Ah...

270
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:55,899
Why...

271
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:57,859
don’t you tell me to buy a coffee?

272
00:17:58,259 --> 00:17:59,459
So you don’t have to come by yourself.

273
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:00,899
No worries.

274
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,419
It’s not that far, I can take care myself.

275
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,499
But yesterday, you treated me like a servant.

276
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:07,499
Damn it, Mustache!

277
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:12,779
Eak, your order is ready!

278
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:14,019
Okay.

279
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:18,139
Thank you.

280
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,579
And this is your.

281
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,019
Thank you.

282
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:25,379
Oh, Ryu!

283
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,739
Do you remember the project I mentioned to Ryu?

284
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,179
The one where I said to you would be helping me?

285
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:31,699
Oh.

286
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:33,699
I remember.

287
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,299
My brand is about to finalize things now.

288
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,099
I will call you again.

289
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:40,499
Sure!

290
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,539
I'll excuse myself to get back to work now.

291
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:43,659
Okay.

292
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:53,259
No late for sure.

293
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,939
You're done for me, Mustache!

294
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,099
No late for sure.

295
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,499
100% sure!

296
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:33,099
It’s time for you, Mustache!

297
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,499
You will know today,

298
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,379
who’s you playing with.

299
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,379
Consider that I going easy on you.

300
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,339
It your turn!

301
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:40,699
Um.

302
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:46,419
You're back, troublemaker?

303
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,779
I’m so sorry!

304
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,979
I was in a meeting.

305
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:56,099
Ryu!

306
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:59,779
Miss you so much!

307
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,179
Clam down!

308
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,179
Breath in deeply!

309
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:08,619
I really missing you.

310
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:11,979
But it took me so long to get in.

311
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,059
So tried!

312
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:14,459
I’m sorry.

313
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,899
I didn’t tell Run that you will coming today.

314
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,339
[sigh]

315
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,979
And your little sister is really something else.

316
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,139
When she was a kid, she wasn’t this fierce.

317
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,739
Why she was so....

318
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:26,259
Yeah...

319
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,059
I will tell you when I’m free.

320
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,179
Um...

321
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,579
Have you eat anything yet.

322
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,899
Not yet, I’m starving now.

323
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:40,099
Wonder if I'll get to taste someone's cooking around here today.

324
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,099
Of course!

325
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,179
Since your are back in Thailand,

326
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,939
I'll cook and show off my skills myself.

327
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,939
Great! I've really missed your cooking.

328
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:54,339
When I was there,

329
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,659
It’s really hard to find Thai’s food

330
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:57,699
And it’s very expensive.

331
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,219
I can't cook for myself.

332
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:01,339
Today I going to clean the plate!

333
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:02,259
Let's do it!

334
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,099
Go!!

335
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:09,779
Wow!

336
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,059
Everything looks so delicious, Ryu!

337
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:15,499
ทําเยอะมาก เลี้ยงคนได้ทั้งหมู่บ้านเลยนะเนี่ย

338
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:17,539
Oh yeah,

339
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,379
Since you're back in Thailand, I have to go all out!

340
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,979
My big brother is so sweet!

341
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:26,579
Humm...

342
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:28,739
I’m not a dog.

343
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,259
Hm, Ryu.

344
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:36,459
but even though I was away from Thailand for only a few years,

345
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,939
a lot of things have changed

346
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:41,899
Oh? P'New, aren't you eating?

347
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,379
I’m waiting for Run.

348
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:48,539
So spicy.

349
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:52,499
Run!

350
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:53,739
Sit.

351
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,179
Here!

352
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,739
Ryu cooked a lot of food!

353
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:19,219
That’s your favorite fried chicken.

354
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:23,459
Yeah! Ryu cooked it especially for you.

355
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:40,979
I'm going to eat upstairs.

356
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:45,619
Ryu...

357
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:47,979
Why she is...

358
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,259
Um!

359
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:51,499
Never mind.

360
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:55,819
Hurry up and eat! If it gets cold, it won’t taste as good.

361
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:56,899
I won't make it again!

362
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:29,339
Working at this hour? When do you even sleep, Arm?

363
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,219
When?

364
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,099
In the morning.

365
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:34,779
If you didn’t tell me,

366
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,859
I would probably think your boss absolutely hates him.

367
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:41,099
Did you do something to him?

368
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,019
Why is your boss so...

369
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,539
You're just a kid—go to bed.

370
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:47,539
I need to work.

371
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,219
Hey, Ohm.

372
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,139
Why are you bothering him?

373
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:57,219
Go to bed now, sweetie. You have to go to school early tomorrow.

374
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,659
Alright, mom.

375
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:02,459
Good luck, big bro! Might as well work until morning!

376
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:08,579
Goodnight, bro.

377
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:11,979
Woah!

378
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,859
Why have you got so much work?

379
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:19,339
I still got a lot to do.

380
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:22,259
I already finish a lot,

381
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,499
I don’t why?

382
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,139
The more I do, the more it seems to pile up.

383
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,339
Is there anything I can help?

384
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:36,939
My boss, Mom.

385
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:39,139
My first day at work.

386
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:41,979
He dumped a ton of work on me!

387
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,219
And he even said they want it done by tomorrow!

388
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:46,299
The worst part, Mom,

389
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:49,499
is that tomorrow I have to go inspect the work with him too!

390
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,979
I'm so tired, Mom.

391
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,899
Every job is tiring in its own way, sweetheart.

392
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:00,379
You're working in an air-conditioned office in front of a computer,

393
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:02,099
and you're already complaining?

394
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,779
Look at some people, like the cleaning lady.

395
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,299
She has to sweep, mop, and clean all day long, sweetheart.

396
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,539
No air-conditioned.

397
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,779
And she earns even less than we do.

398
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,539
They can Handle it.

399
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:17,579
This is just your first step.

400
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,659
Already complaining about being tired?

401
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:23,259
My child even graduated from studying abroad.

402
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,259
Then show your boss what you're capable of!

403
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,699
How good you are.

404
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:33,739
Then let my boss see for himself!

405
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,459
He doesn't like me, Mom.

406
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,619
This is a hardest part.

407
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,339
Student life and working life are so different.

408
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,139
You see?

409
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,299
Do you know?

410
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:54,379
How can we get people to like us without spending a single cent?

411
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:58,579
Is there is?

412
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:00,099
Investing without investment.

413
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:01,659
Yes.

414
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:03,299
Like this.

415
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,379
Smile?

416
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,099
Yeah.

417
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:08,499
Is it hard?

418
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:13,059
Then you have to smile more.

419
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,099
Even what you have face.

420
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:17,299
Just remember,

421
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:19,899
Smile can win anything.

422
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:22,539
Thank you, mom.

423
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,219
Fighting!

424
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:27,339
Work hard,

425
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:28,459
and keep fighting!

426
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,230
Um...

427
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,270
"It's so delicious, I'm totally full!"

428
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,910
Thank lots!

429
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,470
Hm...

430
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,470
Since I come back,

431
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,950
I haven’t ask you.

432
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,190
How are you now?

433
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,110
Same thing same day.

434
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,230
In the morning, going to work.

435
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,670
Evening, come back and work.

436
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,310
At night I’m going out to drink.

437
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,510
Drink?!

438
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,430
Have you check up your medical exam?

439
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,190
Because I can’t sleep.

440
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,030
Go have a few drinks to get a little tipsy,

441
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,270
and when you're sleepy, just come back and sleep.

442
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,870
Did you still remember the old day?

443
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,510
I’m worry about you.

444
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,070
As for drinking, take it easy if you can.

445
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,350
Um...

446
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,230
But now I get better.

447
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,990
Only time can truly help you get better.

448
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,470
Hm,

449
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,070
Why I have to drama?

450
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,630
Yeah, so what did you want to talk to me about?

451
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,270
It like this,

452
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,870
I got a new project

453
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,270
I have to go work out of town.

454
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,070
Can I ask you to look after the house and Ran while I'm away?

455
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,910
What?

456
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,830
To look after the house I can do it.

457
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,510
But Run,

458
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,910
I can’t handle it.

459
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,470
You sister is so...

460
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,990
Please...

461
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,430
Just think of Ran as your little sister

462
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,270
feed her, take care of her, and that's it

463
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,510
I will try my best!

464
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,710
How many day you going?

465
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,630
I’m not sure.

466
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,070
Maybe

467
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,310
Half a month.

468
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,030
Half a month?

469
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,710
I’m dying!

470
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,310
You'll probably hear news of a murder first.

471
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,270
Yeah, yeah, just go with it.

472
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,590
Since you come back

473
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,110
you haven’t update me,

474
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,230
How were you?

475
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,470
I’m going good,

476
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,150
I can do whatever I want.

477
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,350
I can go anywhere I want.

478
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,670
As for the business...

479
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,150
It's going pretty well. Foreigners really like it.

480
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,550
That’s good

481
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,630
Seeing you do what you love and being happy makes me happy too.

482
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,430
Um.

483
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,030
You already cooked.

484
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,670
I will clean up for you.

485
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,630
How was it, Boss?

486
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,830
I’m working all night.

487
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,350
Is that cool?

488
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,070
Boss...

489
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,630
Do you want to have some chips?

490
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,470
No, I don’t like chips.

491
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,630
It's useless.

492
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,070
Don’t eat chips.

493
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,550
But drink,

494
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,750
That's so contradictory.

495
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,870
What did you say?

496
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,150
Nothing sir.

497
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,510
Don’t you think that...

498
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,750
thinking that being punctual

499
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,550
will make you look good in my eyes is so contradictory.

500
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,070
I’m not you friend.

501
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,190
Not even close.

502
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,670
If you got a mistake,

503
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,390
You'll damaging the company's reputation.

504
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,190
Passing the probation? just keep dreaming.

505
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,070
Yes, Boss.

506
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,870
Glad you understand.

507
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,470
Buffalo!

508
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,670
I’m not going!

509
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,510
If I go,

510
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,350
You can call me a buffalo.

511
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,710
Oh no...

512
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,950
The mustache guy heard it.

513
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,870
mustache guy!

514
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,670
Driver, Stop the van,

515
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,510
I need to take a dump.

516
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,670
Hello, Ryu.

517
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,430
Hello, how are you? Ton Mai and Ton Nam have you doing well?

518
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,750
I’m well.

519
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,350
Let's go! Uncle Chit is waiting inside.

520
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,270
Sure!

521
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,590
Hey,

522
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,990
Let’s go, Buffalo!

523
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,710
Is there is? invest without investing money.

524
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,470
Smile.

525
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,430
Uncle, Ryu is here!

526
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,750
Hey.

527
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,870
Hi, Uncle Chit.

528
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,790
How are you, Are you good?

529
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,030
You call me like an old person.

530
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,750
Hi, uncle Chit, I’m Arm.

531
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,310
I’m here to study and observe the work at the E Tong Pilok village.

532
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,350
Please take care of me and I look forward to learning from you!

533
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,710
Alright, alright, alright!

534
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,830
We're all like family here, just make yourself at home!

535
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,030
By the way, you've had a long journey.

536
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,830
Let's grab some food and drink first!

537
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,870
Please!

538
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,990
Once we're done,

539
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,430
I'll have Ton Nam and Ton Mai take you to check out the accommodation.

540
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,270
Wow!

541
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,270
Sounds great, Uncle Chit! I'm really hungry right now!

542
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:30,430
Lets go!

543
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,670
Lets go!

544
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,470
Here is it.

545
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,190
Your accommodation.

546
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,830
No Air- condition?

547
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,110
Stay with nature,

548
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,150
Why would you need AC?

549
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,590
Being so close to the stream,

550
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,710
the air at night must be cool and comfortable.

551
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,590
No AC I can stay.

552
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,870
Well, if people around here can't sleep

553
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,990
and find it difficult,

554
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,950
they might as well head to a hotel in the city to rest.

555
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,310
Not what you think.

556
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,030
I’m just asking.

557
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,710
If that's the case, should the two of us go ahead

558
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,270
and carry the bags up for you?

559
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,230
No need, I will do it myself.

560
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,430
Thank you so much! Anyway, the two of you can help Uncle Chit.

561
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,830
Then, goodnight.

562
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,870
Boss,

563
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,790
I’m bagging you...

564
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,150
Don't think that I'm like a spoiled kid

565
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,710
who can't handle hard work or can't do anything!

566
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,750
Or it not true?

567
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,910
It’s not true!

568
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,430
This time I'm working in the province,

569
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,150
I'll show you that you're wrong about me!

570
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,070
Little weakling!

571
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,310
I’m afraid of darkness

572
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,430
gecko!

573
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,870
gecko!

574
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,390
gecko!

575
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,390
gecko!

576
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,790
gecko!

577
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,070
gecko!

578
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,070
gecko!

579
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,590
Hey, why does my life have to face something like this?

580
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,950
Is there only one bed?

581
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,470
who told you it have only one bed?

582
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,070
There!

583
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,270
Your bed.

584
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,030
What?

585
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,750
Who said you're not a spoiled brat?

586
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,110
But you are boss.

587
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,910
You have to sacrifice for me.

588
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,430
Okay!

589
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,950
There!

590
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,550
Your bed!

591
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,670
Next time is my turn!

592
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,870
Please pack my bag for me.

593
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,670
Yes Sir!

594
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,670
What the hell are you doing?

595
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,030
Haven’t you finish?

596
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,910
Do you know that other is waiting?

597
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,430
I give you 10 minutes!

598
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,390
If you don't finish, there will be trouble.

599
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,510
Then, can you please grab the shampoo for me?

600
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,670
I’m not variable!

601
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,070
I’m in rush!

602
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:57,710
If you need it,

603
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,350
Get it by yourself.

604
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,630
What the hell!

605
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,630
You heartless person!

606
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,350
What's wrong? Never seen a person before?

607
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,430
Oh, no!

608
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,710
No!

609
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,470
Fuck!
