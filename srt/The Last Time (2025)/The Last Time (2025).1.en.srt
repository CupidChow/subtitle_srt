00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,960
Mom

2
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Hello, mom.

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,720
Arm, where are you?

4
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
I’m at the gym.

5
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,800
hum?

6
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,680
Isn't today your first day at work?

7
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm doomed!

8
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
How did you for get it?

9
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
You know how strict Uncle is.

10
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,800
If you're late, don't make excuses to your uncle.

11
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Just apologize and accept the consequences.

12
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,120
I found a parking!

13
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,600
I thought I was going to be late.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Whoa!

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
What the hell!

16
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200
Hey!

17
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,560
Didn't you see that I was about to park?

18
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,960
What kind of person do you have to be for this?

19
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,640
Didn't you see that I was about to...

20
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,760
Didn't you see that I was about to park?

21
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,920
why did you take my parking spot like this?

22
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
You almost hit my car just now!

23
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
If I hadn't braked, what would have happened?

24
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
What the...

25
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,640
Aren't you ashamed?

26
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,200
Shouldn't I be the one worried about getting hit by a car?

27
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,840
How shameless do you have to be to say something like that?

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
I will park here!

29
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
shameless!

30
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Judging by your face, you're not that young anymore.

31
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Also looking good.

32
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,560
But you have no manners at all.

33
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
You little brat!

34
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,080
You old man! A grown-up not worthy of respect!

35
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
You...

36
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,000
Why are you so shameless?

37
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
Move back! I'm in a hurry!

38
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
You go instead!

39
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
This is my parking spot!

40
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,600
Why are you so stubborn?

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,480
How could this be your parking spot?

42
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a public parking space. Open your eyes and look!

43
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,600
Here it is.

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,880
A great start to my first day at work.

45
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,480
Thanks to this mustached guy!

46
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,680
Welcome to the first day of work

47
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,720
for the handsome younger brother of the president!

48
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,880
Woah!

49
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,240
Yeah!

50
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
Arm!

51
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,280
First day on the job, and you're already late, Arm!

52
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Don’t you think,

53
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,800
that you could be as careless as you were when studying abroad?

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,080
Not like what you think.

55
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,400
I mean...

56
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
You don’t need to make excuses.

57
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,360
I didn’t make any excuses

58
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,480
I really want to intern at Uncle's company!

59
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but...

60
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Do you still remember what we agreed on?

61
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,000
The one that...

62
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
That you didn't graduate from university,

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,040
and your mom and aunt still don't know.

64
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Sure!

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,760
I won’t tell your mom and aunt.

66
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,640
And I'm going to send you back to studies in England.

67
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
But you have to pass your internship.

68
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Uncle!

69
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,360
I will tell you that...

70
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,800
this is so easy for me.

71
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Here he is!

72
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,000
This is Ryu, the one who will train you.

73
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
Mustache guy!

74
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,520
What the...

75
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,400
Aren't you ashamed?

76
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,080
Shouldn't I be the one worried about getting hit by a car?

77
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,560
How shameless do you have to be to say something like that?

78
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
you’re ashamed!

79
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
You little brat!

80
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
You old man! A grown-up not worthy of respect!

81
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,000
I don’t want to train with this guy!

82
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Why?

83
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
What was happens?

84
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,240
At first, you were desperate to intern at the company.

85
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,040
This is just your first day.

86
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,480
Now you don’t want to intern anymore?

87
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,440
It's not that I don't want to intern at your company, Uncle.

88
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,360
But I don’t want to train with him.

89
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,160
But this is the person I've given authority to.

90
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,560
And he's the one who will sign off on your internship approval.

91
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,800
Uncle...

92
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Mr. Ryu,

93
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll leave my nephew in your care.

94
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,000
You can put him to work however you like

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
consider him yours to use.

96
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,480
As for you, whether you want to intern or not is up to you.

97
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,600
If you fail your internship,

98
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,720
I'll consider our agreement null and void.

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh my! Are you Arm?

100
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
Hello!

101
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Oh wow! Hello, Auntie! You're still working here?

102
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,840
Oh, Arm! You never change.

103
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,200
Why are you calling me Auntie?

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
Just call me sister.

105
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,120
how could you even ask if I'm still working here?

106
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
If I don’t work here,

107
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,640
Where Should I go then?

108
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
You can work wherever you want, it's up to you.

109
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,600
Alright, as you wish.

110
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Then I'll work here. This place seems nice and comfortable.

111
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,600
Oh!

112
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,080
By the way, Arm, have you graduated yet?

113
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,120
Yes!

114
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,080
Someone like me? How could I not graduate?

115
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm naturally talented, Auntie!

116
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,520
Awesome!

117
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
I was thought like that, You are number one!

118
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,080
If you're really that talented, prove it to others.

119
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,120
Don't just talk big.

120
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,760
This is all the company's work.

121
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
Read it and summarize it for me by the end of today.

122
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,280
Then I will train you.

123
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,160
This is nothing! It won’t be a problem for me.

124
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
Who’s said?

125
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
What the hell!

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
What’s Wrong, Arm?

127
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,520
Have you done your work?

128
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,400
Of course!

129
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,920
Good thing that mustache guy only gave me one file to work on.

130
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,560
Calm down!

131
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,440
Whoa, bro! I can't stay calm anymore.

132
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm super stressed!

133
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,760
Do you want to relieve some stress?
