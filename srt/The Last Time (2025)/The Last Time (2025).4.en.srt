1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

2
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,760
Mr. Arm

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
Where have you been starving for beer?

4
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,600
This little bit of beer
won't do anything to me!

5
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
No!

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don’t tell me that...

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
last night, me and that mustache guy...

8
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
[Screaming]

9
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
[Screaming]

10
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,160
Take some hangover medicine.

11
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,159
If you can't go to work, just rest.

12
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,120
I'll take care of work today.

13
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
That mustache guy is actually pretty kind.

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,240
Wait.

15
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,399
Or is this part of his plan

16
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,720
to make me fail my internship?

17
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,080
I won't fall for it. Keep dreaming!

18
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Hey!

19
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,520
Who gave you permission
to take pictures around here?

20
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,640
I've seen plenty of
tourists taking pictures here.

21
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Why can't I take pictures?

22
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,240
I said no, so that means no!

23
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
This Place

24
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,439
I take care of it.

25
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,879
If you want to take photos,

26
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,120
then you pay me.

27
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,759
Then I will delete all photos

28
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
and please give my camera back too.

29
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,120
Do you want camera back?

30
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,799
"Even if you delete
it, you still have to pay.

31
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,560
You've already committed the offense.

32
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
I just look you form outside,

33
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,600
you must be some rich kid.

34
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,760
If you want this back give me 5,000

35
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,480
Damn scammers!

36
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
Oh? Got a sharp tongue, huh?

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey!

38
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,400
What is going on here?

39
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
It's these guys! A
bunch of society's trash.

40
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,680
You've got a sharp tongue, huh?

41
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,080
I'll make you put on a show
for the kids around here!

42
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
He is my people!

43
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,680
Think before you doing any thing

44
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,040
Be careful, or you won't
be able to stay here.

45
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
Won't be able to stay here?

46
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Who you think who you are?

47
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,240
What are you, the governor or something?

48
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,080
You think you can make me leave?

49
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I’m not,

50
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
But I know.

51
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,640
If you not getting out of here,

52
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
let’s wait and see!

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hello, Governor!

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is Ryu.

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,400
Boss, Or he really know the Governor?

56
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't believe him. I can do that too!

57
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
Right now,

58
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm in a dispute with some locals,

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
but from what I can tell,

60
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
they seem like scammers.

61
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
If this goes on any longer,

62
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,320
the governor's area will
definitely get a bad reputation.

63
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,919
Governor, could you send someone...

64
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,999
Wait!

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Clam down!

66
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
Here is your camera.

67
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,520
I was just messing around a little,

68
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,320
no need to be so serious.

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
Go ahead, take all the pictures you want.

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Go! Dum!

71
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Wow!

72
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
Boss!

73
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,000
You’re so cool!

74
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Boss, do you know the governor?

75
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
So Cool!

76
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
No,

77
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
It’s Mod phone number.

78
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Here boss!

79
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,240
Black coffee, I remember that you like it.

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
Boss...

81
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Just drink it.

82
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,360
I didn’t put any poison in it.

83
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,480
I already buy, drink it!

84
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,279
Boss

85
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,800
You was so fucking cool!

86
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,799
"I never thought that a calm
and serious boss like you,

87
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
would have an even scarier side.

88
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
You are my people.

89
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,840
So I have to take care of you.

90
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,280
If you got anything happen

91
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,120
The President is giving me a hard time.

92
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Boss

93
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,119
Do you know what?

94
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
Why do I have to intern
at my uncle's company?

95
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,800
Back when I was abroad,

96
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,520
I was so rebellious that I
got expelled from school.

97
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,479
And then I was sent back to Thailand.

98
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,400
Mom still doesn't know about this.

99
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
My uncle is the only one who knows.

100
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,599
So I made a deal with my uncle

101
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,000
if I successfully complete
my internship at his company,

102
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,400
he'll send me back abroad.

103
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,720
Why do you have to tell me?

104
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
I know that you don’t really like me.

105
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,000
How about this?

106
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,800
Let's make a deal.

107
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,479
You'll be a good boss, and
I'll be a good subordinate.

108
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,800
I'll follow all your orders.

109
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,599
And if I can make you change your mind,

110
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,159
you'll sign off on my internship
and approve my completion

111
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,760
so I can go back abroad.

112
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Sounds good,

113
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,960
but I’m not making any promises.

114
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Damn mustache guy!

115
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
By the way, did you
already order more drinks?

116
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Ouch!

117
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
When you say it,

118
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,400
I’ve got a headache right away boss.

119
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Do you realize that since
we arrived in Kanchanaburi,

120
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,679
we've been working every single day?

121
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,200
We haven’t gone anywhere for fun yet!

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,919
Ouch, ouch... Another headache.

123
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,400
Ugh!

124
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,040
Focus on you work.

125
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,120
People are strange, huh?

126
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,920
They forget their own words so easily.

127
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Okay boss, Then let work now!

128
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
Weren’t you going on a trip?

129
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,520
Hurry up, or I might change my mind!

130
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,760
Yes! let’s go!

131
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,640
Wait for me boss!

132
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,440
What is this?

133
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,080
Of all places to take me on a
trip, you brought me to a temple?

134
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Come here!

135
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,639
You're not that bad after all.

136
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,480
Hard to believe I used to really hate you.

137
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
Do you know what...

138
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
Today my feeling has change,

139
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,960
because of the kind of
person you're becoming.

140
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,240
Work hard and don’t give up.

141
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,280
I’ll help you.

142
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Does it really have?

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Someone who is kind to us

144
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
without any conditions.

145
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Are you really that kind of person?

146
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Boss

147
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,200
I want to asking you this for a long time.

148
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,400
How long have you work here?

149
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Many years

150
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,320
So, why did you choose
to work in this field?

151
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,840
Um boss...

152
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,079
Can I ask another question?

153
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,120
What do you like to eat?

154
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,240
Why you have to know it?

155
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Why not?

156
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,159
"So when you ask me to buy something,

157
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,600
I’ll get the right one!

158
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,959
Otherwise, you'll scold me again

159
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
if I don’t buy the right one.

160
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,560
I like to eat Pad Kra Pao without spice.

161
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,200
Without holy basil leaves.

162
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,440
Really boss?

163
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
You know what?

164
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:26,999
I like to eat the same with you.

165
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,839
I like to eat Pad Kra Pao with minced pork,

166
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,199
not spicy, and without basil leaves.

167
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,920
I absolutely hate basil leaves!

168
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,439
It smells bad.

169
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,480
Do you think so too, boss?

170
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Boss!

171
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,760
Do you thing that I’m looking good?

172
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
What!?

173
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Hey!

174
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,120
Back when I was in
school, I was super popular.

175
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,000
Girls were all over me!

176
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,040
Such a bragger!

177
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,760
I’m saying the truth!

178
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,040
I once scheduled a date
with four girls at the same time!

179
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,199
Wait… wouldn’t that cause a train wreck?

180
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Wow boss,

181
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,520
What do you think happened?
It was a total disaster!

182
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
See, you can smile!

183
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,320
Why do you always look so
serious and grumpy all the time?

184
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Like,

185
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,480
constantly tense and frowning?

186
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,080
Like you carry the whole world.

187
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm seriously asking, boss.

188
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,520
Do you have something on your mind?

189
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,640
You can talk to me.

190
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
I think we should go back now.

191
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Ugh!

192
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
Quick!

193
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,959
"The air is chilly here,
and it gets dark quickly.

194
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,560
If we don't head down the mountain soon,

195
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Ouch!

196
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Help me!

197
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Run!

198
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,519
Next time, turn on the lights!

199
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,080
Why do you always do things in the dark?

200
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,600
Are you a bat?

201
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,719
Complain, complain, complain, complain...

202
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,416
Well, isn’t it something
worth complaining about?

203
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,320
Clumsy and always doing pointless things.

204
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
Look at you face.

205
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,200
I might just pour saline on your wound!

206
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Ouch!

207
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,600
Hmph, I thought you
were good at everything.

208
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,879
Now that I've applied the medicine,

209
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,080
be careful not to get the wound wet.

210
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,240
Yes, nurse.

211
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Thank you, sis.

212
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,039
You're pretty gentle.

213
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,680
Treating the wound didn’t hurt at all."

214
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,640
Good job Toon!

215
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,160
You learn really fast!

216
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,599
I’ve been training you
for less than two weeks,

217
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,400
and you’ve already
picked up all the details.

218
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,800
I should thank you, Ryu.

219
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,799
You taught me what’s important,

220
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,919
what comes first,

221
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,760
and what comes after.

222
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,920
Difficult things became so much easier.

223
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Wow!

224
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,520
These two get along so well!

225
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,520
Both the boss and the subordinate.

226
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,920
"But anyway, Toon, I’ll leave
these documents with you.

227
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,600
If there’s anything you don’t understand,

228
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,400
just ask Ryu. This guy is really sharp!

229
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Damn!

230
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,320
What is going on?

231
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,800
Nothing. Stay out of it.

232
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Move!

233
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,920
Mom!

234
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,519
Mom, P'Toon got into a fight again.

235
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
He even has a wound on his face!

236
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,280
This fucking kid!

237
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,200
Toon! What are you doing?

238
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
What is happend to your face?

239
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
I’m not a kid, mom!

240
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,760
Stop meddling in my business already!

241
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
I warned you, didn’t
I? Stay out of trouble!

242
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,000
You ran into Ryu, didn’t you?

243
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
What!?

244
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Toon!

245
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,160
Don't tell me you went...

246
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,920
Mom, don’t you remember

247
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
what Ryu did to me?

248
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,919
Who do you think is to blame
for my life ending up like this?

249
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
For me hitting rock bottom

250
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,240
and being stuck here?

251
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,719
If it weren’t for him,

252
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,560
my life wouldn’t have turned out like this.

253
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,600
Haven't you already caused
enough trouble for this family?

254
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,176
You really feel no remorse
at all, do you, Toon?

255
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,440
You're blaming me, you cripple?

256
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Toon Stop!

257
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,599
You are brother!

258
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
Why you have to fight each other?

259
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,920
You’re always like this

260
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,400
only loving him.

261
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,040
Have you ever loved me?

262
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,240
Why would you say that? We're all we have.

263
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,960
I love all my children equally.

264
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,960
Fuck it!

265
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,200
I just want to know—how can you
hate your own brother this much?

266
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,640
Forget about just hating him...

267
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,400
even his face I don’t wont to look at it.

268
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,160
Then can you tell me what
happened between Ryu and you?

269
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Do you know?

270
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,880
Ryu’s family never liked me

271
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
not even a single person.

272
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Also Ryu.

273
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
I told you, didn’t I?

274
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,480
Don’t bring that crazy kid into my house!

275
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,720
Bringing him in as a burden.

276
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Are you sure

277
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
it’s your sister?

278
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Do you know for sure

279
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,200
that it’s really my blood?

280
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,599
So, this is the reason you hates Ryu?

281
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Right!

282
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,720
Do you think Run should
love someone who hates him?

283
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Dad!

284
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,840
แต่ที่ณรินทร์ตรอมใจตาย

285
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,480
But the reason Narin died of a
broken heart is because of Dad.

286
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,280
And also,

287
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,960
they are the ones who caused my mom death.

288
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Her mother

289
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,600
She's not some perfect woman, you know.

290
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,200
I don't even know how
many men she's been with.

291
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,080
I stopped contacting her, stopped
giving him money. Isn't that fair enough?

292
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Stopped giving her money.
Isn't that fair enough?

293
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,400
I stand by my word.

294
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,840
You need to get this crazy kid out
of my house as soon as possible.

295
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,280
Mom died of a broken heart
because she was a mistress.

296
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,720
Do you think that’s fair to Mom?

297
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,479
Run, But Ryu also...

298
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,680
You’re just like Ryu.

299
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Run!

300
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Run.

301
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Pin.

302
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I’m so tired.

303
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
When will we get to meet?

304
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Ryu!

305
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,600
You have to be strong!

306
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,840
There are still people who love you.

307
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,840
You're about to meet them.

308
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,280
Thank you so much, Arm!

309
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,959
It’s okay, boss.

310
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
It’s just a small thing.

311
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Um...

312
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Boss,

313
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
you sure have a lot of enemy, huh?

314
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
But I’m not surprised.

315
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,680
By the way, Do you know who did this?

316
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,960
I think it’s just a misunderstanding.

317
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,680
Are you alright?

318
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Why not?

319
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Ouch!

320
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Take it easy.

321
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,880
You said it's fine.

322
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
I thought you were gonna be tough.

323
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,440
Stop it!

324
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,440
I’m going back to the room!

325
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,760
If you can't handle
it, don't force yourself.

326
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,320
Hello, President.

327
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,840
How was your work?

328
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Work?

329
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,160
Um...

330
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,240
Oh, Work?

331
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,640
นี่หัวหน้าเพิ่งโดนกระทืบมา

332
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
Boss, just got beaten up.

333
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,800
I don't even know if
the work will be finished.

334
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,000
I going to call you,

335
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,400
But boss said

336
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,719
He can handle it!

337
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,920
Look at the state of
the person handling it.

338
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
Sorry, president.

339
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,080
I thought I could handle
something like this.

340
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,320
Okay...

341
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,680
If you can't handle it, no worries.

342
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,559
I’ll send P'Ek and Ek to help you out.

343
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,320
Next time something
happens, you have to tell me.

344
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Sure.

345
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
Thank you.

346
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,040
Let’s go boss.

347
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,480
I will bring you back to the room.

348
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,840
You really can't handle this in this state.

349
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Bro.

350
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,080
Please stop being mad already.

351
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,720
Don't stay upset for too long,

352
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
it makes me feel uneasy.

353
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
You...

354
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,560
So this is how it's going to be, huh?

355
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,320
If you won’t talk to me,

356
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,280
then I’ll just sit right here

357
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,720
and not go anywhere.

358
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Mr. Eak

359
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,600
What going on between both of you?

360
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,960
I've seen you sulking since this morning."

361
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Mr. Pee

362
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,279
Look at his face

363
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,120
that's really pitiful.

364
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,080
You're sitting there like a dog waiting
for its owner to take it for a walk.

365
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,960
Mr. Eak And Mr. Pee

366
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,040
The president has requested
to see you in their office.

367
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Take a sit.

368
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,119
We've already heard the
news about Arm and Ryu

369
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,320
in Kanchanaburi, right?

370
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Yes.

371
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,960
When I heard the news,

372
00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:23,920
I felt uneasy,

373
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,360
so I wanted us to go help
them out in Kanchanaburi.

374
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,720
What?

375
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Me and this guy?

376
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,400
Me and Eak

377
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,719
help Ryu with work in Kanchanaburi?

378
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,280
Right.

379
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,080
Do you have any problem?

380
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,960
I don’t have any problem.

381
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,680
Whatever the director says,

382
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,400
I’ll go along with it.

383
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
How about you, Pee?

384
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,760
I'm not really available at the moment.

385
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,520
Why?

386
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,319
If he weren’t sick or unwell,

387
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,560
I wouldn’t be asking you guys for help.

388
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,080
If you are not going

389
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,320
this job isn't going to be
finished as per the contract.

390
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,200
I can't guarantee what will happen.

391
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,800
Alright, then I’ll go.

392
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
Hmm, that's it.

393
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,080
If you need any help, you
can contact me through Boong.

394
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,919
Can’t you remember what was he did to me?

395
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,800
What was he did to me?

396
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,879
My life ended up like this,

397
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,360
hit rock bottom,

398
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,280
and I had to be here because of who?

399
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,719
If it weren’t for him,

400
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,560
my life wouldn’t have turned out this way.

401
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,720
Hey! So what’s the deal?

402
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,119
Where’s that one million

403
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,320
you said you’d transfer
to me three days ago?

404
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,559
Ou think just because I'm being
nice, you can dodge me again?

405
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,360
You can dodge me again?

406
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,520
Didn't I say I'd transfer it today?

407
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,320
You think I'm that nice?

408
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,080
You wanna play games with me, huh?

409
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Keng,

410
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,680
can you give me three more days?

411
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,761
I'll find the money and pay
you back as soon as possible.

412
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,920
You think I'm a charity or what?

413
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,800
Three days is too long.

414
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,840
No matter what,

415
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:38,376
you have to transfer the
money to me within tomorrow.

416
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,199
If you keep messing around,

417
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,960
I'll come find you at
your company for sure.

418
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,720
Toon, can you help me deposit this check?

419
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,040
Can you help me deposit this check?

420
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,520
I'll be relying on you a lot these days

421
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,440
since the finance team
is on maternity leave.

422
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,880
Thanks! I'm counting on you.

423
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Hello, Jane.

424
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,720
I have the money to pay you back now.

425
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
By the way

426
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,920
Tonight, please send me the big match odds.

427
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,480
Did you go see Ryu?

428
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,521
Haven't you already caused
enough trouble for the family?

429
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,160
You really have no remorse, do you, Toon?

430
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,280
How you going to explain this?

431
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I didn’t do it!

432
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
I don’t know anything.

433
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Someone is framing me.

434
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
Toon!

435
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
You made a mistake,

436
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,920
and you accepts responsibility.

437
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,160
All the money transferred
out of the company.

438
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
I have checked.

439
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,320
It was transfer into your bank account.
