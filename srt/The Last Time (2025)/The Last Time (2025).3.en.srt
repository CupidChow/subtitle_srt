1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,440
Since I’m already here, I gotta take a bath like this!

2
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
Wow!

3
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Wow!

4
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
Have you not ready to go yet?

6
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,200
Do you know that you're making everyone wait?

7
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,480
I give you 10 minutes

8
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,440
If you don't finish, you gonna be trouble!

9
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,560
Then, boss, can you pass me the soap?

10
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm not available.

11
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
I’m in rush!

12
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,680
If you need it,

13
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,360
then take it yourself.

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,600
What’s up with the boss?

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,600
You cold-hearted person!

16
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,640
What’s wrong? Have you never see a handsome person?

17
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Ouch!

18
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,280
No!

19
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Fuck!

20
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Go away!

21
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Donงt look at my Anaconda!

22
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,640
get out of here!

23
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,720
Go!

24
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
You are crazy!

25
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
I don’t want to look at it.

26
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
Go away!

27
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
I grab it myself!

28
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
Hello, Ryu.

29
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,840
How are you, Mangkorn?

30
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
How are you?

31
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,000
We haven’t meet for a longtime.

32
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
I’m fine!

33
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
How about you?

34
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you sleep well last night?

35
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,800
Um, yeah.

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
This is Din.

37
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
My assistant.

38
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
This is Arm.

39
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,120
My junior colleague at work.

40
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,400
Hi, I’m Arm.

41
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,280
Hi!

42
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,840
Arm, this is Mangkorn.

43
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
My junior from university.

44
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Today, he will be our guide, introducing us to tourist attractions.

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Hello!

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
I’m Arm,

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,040
Please take care of me too!

48
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Hello!

49
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
So where we going to start today?

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,440
Should we start now?

51
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,240
Let’s go!

52
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,000
This is Itong Village

53
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,600
It's a small community hidden in Pilok Subdistrict.

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
in Thong Pha Phum District, Kanchanaburi Province.

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Originally, this community was the site of the Pilok Mine.

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,280
Back when the tin mining industry was thriving,

57
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,040
around the year 1940

58
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
At that time, this place was filled with markets.

59
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,760
The locals came to trade and do business in great numbers.

60
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,200
But then, around the years 1984–1985

61
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,480
The global decline in mineral prices,

62
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,400
caused this community to become quieter and less lively.

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,000
Today, Itong Village has become an ecotourism destination.

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
As everyone can see.

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,800
And around the village,

66
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,200
there are many other tourist attractions to explore.

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,280
Most tourists enjoy strolling along the canal here.

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,120
And they often like to hang signs on that bridge over there.

69
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,040
To mark that they've been here.

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
And over there is another landmark of this place.

71
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
Along both sides of the path,

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,120
we can see souvenir shops.

73
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Clothing shops and various souvenir stores line the way.

74
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,200
If you want to take some souvenirs home...

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,680
Before heading back, you can stop by here.

76
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
And here,

77
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,400
This is the spot where tourists love to write and hang signs.

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
Tourists love to write and hang signs.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
That right!

80
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,280
Arm.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Arm!

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Are you two interested to hanging one?

83
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
I will take a photo for you.

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
That look fun!

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
Should we hang a sigh together?

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
No!

87
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,920
You know...

88
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,640
that I don’t like something like thi....

89
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,280
This place the weather feel like we are in Korea.

90
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,120
Write the name of someone you like,

91
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,160
or writhe a message you want to share.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,320
If we have a partner,

93
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,760
we'd probably want to bring her here too, right?

94
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
If you want to bring them, just do it! No one’s stopping you.

95
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,280
Well, the thing is... I don't have a partner yet.

96
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
I can’t find one.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So I ended up writing one with you first

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,760
Um,

99
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,000
Why you write only you name?

100
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
If you don’t know something for once, will you die?

101
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,240
[Ryu]

102
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,560
[Arm]

103
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't know what to write?

104
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Just write that, then?

105
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200
Um...

106
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,840
I don’t know what to write.

107
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,400
So I wrote only my name and a heart.

108
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,000
One day, if I have a partner,

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,440
they can come and write their name next to my heart.

110
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,160
Hey boss, where are you going?

111
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,840
Cheers!

112
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Boss is gone, time to chill!

113
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,560
Are you guys not working?

114
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,800
Just sitting around eating this early in the morning?

115
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,160
Hey, hey, hey!

116
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,960
I'm gonna tell the boss!

117
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,840
Just a little break, sis!

118
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,440
Once in a while, we don’t have to sit around fearing getting scolded

119
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,640
Yeah.

120
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,600
Then why are you here, sis?

121
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,520
Or do you miss me?

122
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,000
Such a sweet talker, huh?

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sweet like this, even the ants love it—just like I do.

124
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,000
Alright, whatever you brought, just hand it over already!

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,680
What's up with you, Pee?

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't tell me you had too much sugar

127
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
you're acting like an angry dog!

128
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,600
Gun!

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,040
I brought the budget reimbursement documents for you.

130
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Fine, I'll go. Hmph!

131
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Wow!

132
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,960
How awful!

133
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,480
Grinning from ear to ear like someone in love, huh, Pee?

134
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
Wow, wow, wow!

135
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,080
If you're getting a partner, shouldn't you at least tell your friends?

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
I also want to have a boyfriend too, you know!

137
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,400
Right now, I'm way too single!

138
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
Who are you talking with?

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
Smiling to yourself, huh?

140
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,840
A friend.

141
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,960
He happened to get an assignment around here, so he just texted to let me know.

142
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,560
Why you have to smile?

143
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
Why you have to be shy?

144
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,600
But it's probably just a friend, right?

145
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,600
Because with this face and this mouth,

146
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,960
no one would want to date me.

147
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
If anyone ends up dating you,

148
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,160
they must be pretty dumb, right?

149
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,320
Oh, oh! Ran away already? Hey!

150
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,320
What happen to him?

151
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Hey,

152
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
I think you went too far, didn't you?

153
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
I didn’t go too far, I just spoke the truth.

154
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,726
Why are you so hard to eat?

155
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,206
I went all the way to buy this for you at the alley entrance!

156
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,526
I stood in line for so long!

157
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:56,846
Many people said that it delicious!

158
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:57,846
Try it first.

159
00:12:58,606 --> 00:12:59,766
No!

160
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,726
Why told you that it delicious?

161
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,566
Just smelling it makes me want to throw up.

162
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:04,566
What?

163
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:05,126
But...

164
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,526
Ryu said that you like to eat som tam from this place.

165
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,166
Why you talking about him?

166
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,406
Just hearing the name makes me lose my appetite

167
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:21,766
Are you okay, Run?

168
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:26,526
If there's anything bothering you, you can tell me.

169
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:29,926
Stay out of it.

170
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:45,486
Chill out with the nature...

171
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,406
Wow!

172
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,166
Boss, Mangkorn look!

173
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:50,966
That’s very beautiful

174
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:51,486
Yes.

175
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:52,486
Um...

176
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,486
Mangkorn

177
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:55,486
Can you take a photos for me?

178
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:56,286
Sure!

179
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:58,166
Come take a photo together, boss!

180
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:02,326
Ready?

181
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,446
Move closer together, please.

182
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:05,966
Okay!

183
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:07,006
1 2 ...

184
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,606
Ryu, smile a bit!

185
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,686
Smile a bit! Just a little more

186
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:14,526
I don’t like to take a photo!

187
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,646
Ryu is always like this

188
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:19,326
he doesn’t really like taking pictures.

189
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,566
Let’s do it again, ready?

190
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,526
1 2 3

191
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,686
Okay!

192
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:27,526
1 2 ...

193
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,526
Ryu, give us a smile! Just a little smile, please!

194
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:33,926
Change a post please.

195
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:34,766
Change a post.

196
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:35,726
Okay!

197
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,006
This is so cute!

198
00:15:37,006 --> 00:15:39,086
1 2 3

199
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:51,606
Wow, this so nice!

200
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,486
I think I have to excuse myself now.

201
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,086
I have to run some errands.

202
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,086
Thank you so much, Mangkon!

203
00:15:58,886 --> 00:15:59,926
No worries, Mangkorn.

204
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,766
I'll take a little walk to enjoy the atmosphere for a bit.

205
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,606
Alright, bro. I'll take my leave then.

206
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,086
Let’s go, Din.

207
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:10,406
Boss.

208
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:11,966
Let’s go!

209
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:12,726
What?

210
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:14,406
Go take some more photo!

211
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:15,606
I’m not going!

212
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,486
Boss, look there first!

213
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,206
I’m not going!

214
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,366
I’m not going, I don’t like to take a photo!

215
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:25,926
Yeah, just take a picture for me, that's enough.

216
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:26,966
No!

217
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:28,606
Old man!

218
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,726
Old where? I just don't like taking pictures.

219
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,526
Toon, where have you been?

220
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:45,886
Are you hungry?

221
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:51,206
I will make Hainanese chicken rice for you to eat.

222
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,766
Toon, who are you mad at again?

223
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,566
Toon,

224
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,046
Have you eat?

225
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,806
I will bring some, alright?

226
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,566
Don't bother me.

227
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:10,726
What the hell wrong with you?

228
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:13,926
Why are you yelling at your brother  like that?

229
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,126
I found him!

230
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:23,526
found him?

231
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:24,806
Who?

232
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:27,446
Fucking Ryu.

233
00:19:30,446 --> 00:19:31,486
So what?

234
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:33,646
Don’t you remember?

235
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,446
You already know why I have to be like this because of whom?

236
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:37,566
Toon!

237
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:38,686
I think you...

238
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:39,566
But it's good as well.

239
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,726
He came to my territory like this.

240
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:44,886
So I don’t have to go to Bangkok.

241
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,926
What are you trying to do?

242
00:19:54,286 --> 00:19:55,086
What I’m going to do?

243
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,406
What’s wrong with him?

244
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:56,606
Wake up!

245
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:58,166
Ouch! What’s wrong with you?

246
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:00,926
how did you end up sleeping here?

247
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:04,086
yesterday I slept down there,

248
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:05,726
and my back got hurt.

249
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,606
Even though I slept on the bed, my back still hurts.

250
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:12,606
Wake up now!

251
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,486
Go take a shower and brush your teeth so we can go eat.

252
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:26,926
Hey you!

253
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:28,566
Why you still on bed?

254
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:45,366
Uh... I can't get up yet, bro.

255
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:51,646
I'll give you 5 minutes, then meet me downstairs.

256
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:00,366
Ouch! What kind of wake is this now? It's a completely different wake!

257
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,286
Get down!

258
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:06,526
now!

259
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:11,126
Get down!

260
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:13,486
What the hell? just go down!

261
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:55,806
This porridge shop serves

262
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:58,446
the most delicious and famous porridge in this area!

263
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,646
Hurry up and eat so we can move on.

264
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,366
Boss!

265
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:10,966
Look at this, boss!

266
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:18,886
Even the fried dough sticks have a pair.

267
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,086
Why I don’t have one?

268
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,646
But I'm not jealous of it.

269
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:30,686
Look here boss.

270
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:36,526
Do you see?

271
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:38,486
In the end,

272
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,766
they will have to be separated by my own hands anyway.

273
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:47,126
What wrong with you?

274
00:23:58,326 --> 00:23:59,766
What are you doing boss?

275
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,366
This is even hotter than before. What did the boss do?

276
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:04,646
Take this!

277
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:16,766
I told you to eat quickly, but not like you're starving to death!

278
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:18,006
Boss!

279
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,486
Boss, do you know,

280
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:22,006
that last night I was so hungry my stomach was growling?

281
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:23,246
When I was in Bangkok,

282
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:25,646
if I got hungry, I could just walk down to 7-Eleven.

283
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:28,606
But here, there aren’t any stores open at all.

284
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:30,646
And you want me to wake up Uncle Chit?

285
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:32,326
I can’t do it.

286
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:34,446
I was so hungry!

287
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:38,326
Then tonight, before we head back to our stay,

288
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,486
let's buy some food to stock up.

289
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,366
Eat quickly!

290
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,246
This shop is really delicious!

291
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,726
[ttamanusorn Wooden Bridge]

292
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:24,846
Hello Ryu, Hello Arm.

293
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:26,646
Hi Din.

294
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:27,646
Um, where...

295
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:31,246
Oh, Mangkon is stuck in a meeting, so he sent me instead.

296
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:36,686
Anyway, please take care of Din today. Shall we go then

297
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:38,006
Sure!

298
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:39,406
But

299
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:43,326
I think since you two have come all the way here,

300
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:46,046
you should try to blend in with the locals a bit.

301
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,181
How was it Din, am I look handsome?

302
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:27,181
You are so handsome!

303
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:29,861
Of course!

304
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,781
พี่ใส่อะไรก็ดูดีอยู่แล้วล่ะ!

305
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:33,781
Um...

306
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,541
Boss! come out.

307
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:19,461
What’s wrong boss?

308
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:20,941
You look like you need to poop.

309
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,861
I never do something like this.

310
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,061
Wow, you're not that young anymore.

311
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,741
Try doing something different for once.

312
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:35,461
Come, come, look that.

313
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:37,461
These are all so beautiful!

314
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:38,941
Yes!

315
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:41,461
Especially during festivals, the bridge gets really crowded.

316
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:42,621
Wow.

317
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:44,621
With so many people, won't the bridge break?

318
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:45,781
No, it won’t break.

319
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:47,141
Here, we have a team that takes care of the maintenance

320
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:48,581
and improvements all the time,

321
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:49,661
so don't worry!

322
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,541
The place where we are standing right now

323
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,661
is called the Mon Bridge,

324
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:55,301
or it is also known as the Uttamanusorn Bridge.

325
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:58,181
It is the longest wooden bridge in Thailand,

326
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:00,741
with a length of 850 meters.

327
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:05,341
So why is there a wooden bridge in Thailand?

328
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:07,341
But the name is of Burmese origin.

329
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:10,221
Ah, the word "Songkalia"

330
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,581
is in the Mon language.

331
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:12,541
It means that in the past,

332
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,541
there was no border division

333
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:15,781
like there is today between the two sides.

334
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:18,381
This allowed both the Burmese and Mon people

335
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:19,901
to visit each other across both sides.

336
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,581
As we know, driving there only takes a short while.

337
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,181
We would have reached Myanmar by now.

338
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:28,621
This has led to a blending of languages and cultures.

339
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,341
In the morning.

340
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:32,101
There will be a alms-giving ceremony,

341
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,901
and tourists like to participate in it.

342
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:38,861
Some tourists choose to stay here.

343
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:41,101
So that they don't have to drive up here,

344
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,021
there are various types of accommodations available.

345
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:44,061
For example hotel

346
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:44,941
resort

347
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:47,181
The prices are according to one's budget.

348
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:49,061
If you have the chance next time,

349
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:51,221
feel free to come up and join the almsgiving.

350
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,661
How long you going to stay here?

351
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:29,381
Would you like the work pass?

352
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:32,741
Of course!

353
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,221
Of course, boss!

354
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:38,581
This is for you.

355
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,581
What wrong with you?

356
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:45,101
Ouch!

357
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,221
I don't have any attraction towards the boss.

358
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,981
It just so happens that someone brought it to sell,

359
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,981
and I helped buy it.

360
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,181
I was going to throw it away, but it felt like a waste.

361
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:54,941
Here, just take it.

362
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,501
Let's go, I'll take you to the boat.

363
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,981
The boat?

364
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:21,181
Cheers!

365
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:32,061
Today, I have to thank Mongkorn very much

366
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,541
for sending the Din to help.

367
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:34,941
If I hadn't Din to help,

368
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:36,981
my work wouldn't be moving this fast.

369
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:41,181
You should be saying that you are really talented for the work to move this fast.

370
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:45,621
On a good day like this, we have to celebrate!

371
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:48,261
