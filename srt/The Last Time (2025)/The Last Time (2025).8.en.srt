1
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,240
I'd like to take a moment of your time.

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
As we all know,

3
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,800
there have been issues with the project we're working on.

4
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,920
However,

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,400
we must move forward with this project,

6
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
even without Ryu.

7
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,680
I've made my decision.

8
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,240
I will appoint Arm as the new project leader in place of Ryu

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
because Arm and Ryu

10
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,040
started this project together from the very beginning.

11
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
Miss Boong

12
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,040
Could you help coordinate with Kanchanaburi province?

13
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,720
Let them know that we've changed the project leader.

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,080
From Ryu to Arm.

15
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,600
Yes, Sir.

16
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,240
I'll get everything coordinated by this afternoon.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,360
But there's one thing I can tell you

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,800
He loves you a lot.

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,480
He never even thought about cheating on you for a single second.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,520
The one who assumed everything on their own was you.

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,040
This is truly your last chance, Ek.

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,600
This is all I can do to help you.

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Does anyone else have anything to say?

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,480
If not, I will...

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes, I do.

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
I know that I'm handsome,

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,720
confident,

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,880
and talented.

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
But this confidence

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,200
is what has led to the biggest regret of my life.

31
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,040
I've just realized that

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
in truth

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm not as talented as I thought.

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
I didn’t know anything at all.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
And more importantly,

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
I’m the biggest fool

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,040
in the world

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
too foolish

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,840
to even understand my own heart.

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,560
Pee

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
I’m sorry.

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,160
I’m sorry for lying to you.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,960
I’m sorry

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,360
That I’m too selfish.

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,840
I’m sorry

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
for hurting your feelings.

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Everyone.

48
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,240
Today

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,640
I will tell all felling

50
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
front of everyone.

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,360
I love Pee

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,960
Love you the most.

53
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
The happiness,

54
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,880
the smile that comes from the person we love,

55
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
this is how beautiful it is.

56
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,760
Thank you for giving me one last chance, Pee.

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,680
Thank you.

58
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,200
That’’s right!

59
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Are you checking the bill?

60
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Please wait a moment.

61
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,000
Ton Mai.

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Ton Mai!

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,800
just a second!

64
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,400
I will call you back.

65
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes uncle.

66
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,400
Recently, you've been acting strange.

67
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

68
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,760
Why are you suddenly asking me this, uncle?

69
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,840
Oh,

70
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,280
don't be shy.

71
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,800
I see you're growing into a young man now.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
"Kids these days grow up so fast.

73
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,120
Look at Non from next door

74
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,440
his wife is pregnant now.

75
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
"Wow, Uncle,

76
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,160
I’m a kid focused on studying first.

77
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,680
Let me lead the way for now.

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,960
I’m not in a hurry.

79
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
Let it be real, okay?

80
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Ah, go

81
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,480
Too enjoy talking,

82
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,960
go collecting money from the customers.

83
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,560
Here incle.

84
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
Keep working hard like this,

85
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
and you'll get rich!

86
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,560
Hey Arm!

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,320
How are  you coming here?

88
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,880
Hello Uncle Chit.

89
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,600
I plan to stay here for a day or two.

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,760
Sure!

91
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,880
For you, it's not a problem at all.

92
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
A few days, or even a week, would be fine.

93
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,680
Hey, is this the bowl, Uncle?

94
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Who ordered this?

95
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
I don’t see any customers.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
The rice porridge is here.

97
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
Arm!

98
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,360
How are you coming?

99
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,600
This is Uncle Chit’s house.

100
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,680
Why I can come here?

101
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,240
If even you can come, then why can't I come?

102
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Go back now!

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,800
No!

104
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
I will stay here tonight!

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
Hey, I told you to come down.

106
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I want to tell you something.

107
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
Right now,

108
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
you can’t order me around anymore

109
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,880
because I’ve resigned from the company.

110
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,640
Resigned?

111
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,400
Are you sure about this?

112
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Didn't you tell me that this project

113
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,160
is your dream,

114
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
and you want to make it successful?

115
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,800
You want to make it good,

116
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
and most importantly,

117
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,800
you don't want to be known as irresponsible like your father, right?

118
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Arm,

119
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,200
is something bothering you?

120
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,080
Would you like to talk to him?

121
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I believe your he can help you.

122
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,680
It's nothing.

123
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
If this project doesn't succeed,

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,280
I probably won’t be able to send you back to study in England.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,200
And I’ll tell your mother

126
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,560
that you didn’t finish university,

127
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,600
Up to you.

128
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
I'll excuse myself.

129
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,040
Arm!

130
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,480
Resigned?

131
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,560
Why?

132
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,680
Since there’s no one I love at the company anymore,

133
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,800
I don't know why I should stay.

134
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Stupid kid.

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
Come down!

136
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,200
Don’t you understand that you can’t order me around anymore?

137
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,840
Because I’ve resigned from the company,

138
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,400
and you’re not my boss anymore.

139
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,280
Do I need to repeat it again?

140
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,800
- You can’t order me around anymore....
- Go take a shower.

141
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,080
Then let's lie down and talk.

142
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Yes Sir!

143
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,440
What are you looking?

144
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,960
I thought

145
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
I wouldn’t get to see you again.

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
You’re so cruel, you know that?

147
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Am I?

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Yes!

149
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
I miss you a lot.

150
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,440
Don’t run away from me.

151
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
Ouch!

152
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,680
What are you doing?

153
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,600
Go take a shower already, so we can go eat.

154
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,480
No shower

155
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,720
Shower!

156
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,400
No shower

157
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,840
Go quickly!

158
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
I still want to lay down.

159
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,560
Go shower!

160
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,360
No!

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,160
No!

162
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,800
No!

163
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,240
Go!

164
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Come here!

165
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,200
No...

166
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:09,043
Pee

167
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,403
Do you think Arm has been acting strange lately?

168
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,963
He doesn’t seem very focused.

169
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:18,163
He seems like someone who’s heartbroken, doesn’t he?

170
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:25,403
Are you free this evening?

171
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,283
Let's go grab something delicious to eat!

172
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:30,323
Shabu!

173
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:32,163
Grilled pork!

174
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:33,523
Or anything.

175
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:35,163
I will pay.

176
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:37,443
Haven’t you finish your work?

177
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,123
Let’s me help

178
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:44,603
I’ll help

179
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:59,483
it's torn, don’t you see it?

180
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:02,483
You're really unlucky.

181
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:04,283
Just stop bothering me already.

182
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:12,763
Just go!

183
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:15,803
What the hell wrong with you?

184
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:20,843
Can’t you talk to me nicely?

185
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,243
If something's wrong, just tell me.

186
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,603
I’m asking you nicely.

187
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:34,443
You’re talking to me like crap.

188
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:42,563
I’m nothing wrong.

189
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:44,283
I’m just hatting you!

190
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:16,603
First...

191
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:19,323
Are you free today?

192
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:30,843
I just wantt to see you.

193
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:35,323
What the hell wrong with you?

194
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:50,843
What are you doing?

195
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:54,803
I have something to talk with you.

196
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:56,483
I don’t have anything to talk.

197
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,043
Get out of my way!

198
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,003
But I have something to talk with you.

199
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:04,963
Please!

200
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,363
I'm not the one you should be talking to.

201
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:21,443
But it’s Pee.

202
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:30,763
The situation has come this far,

203
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,803
and he still won’t even look at my face.

204
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:37,963
First

205
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:40,043
I know

206
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:41,723
that Pee still love you.

207
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,843
Even though I love Pee so much,

208
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:51,003
I know deep down that it's too late now.

209
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:58,083
I don't have a chance to make things right anymore.

210
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,243
I'm happy for you, though.

211
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,043
Please take care him for me

212
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:12,243
I think...

213
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:14,163
you're misunderstanding something, aren’t you?

214
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:17,123
I don’t know how I”m going to tell you.

215
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,003
But there’s one thing I can tell you.

216
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:23,603
He loves you a lot.

217
00:22:24,563 --> 00:22:26,323
He never thought about betraying you, not even for a second.

218
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:29,803
The one who misunderstood is you.

219
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:34,523
I think...

220
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:36,243
Go reflect on yourself

221
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,843
before you lose him forever.

222
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:41,563
What do you mean?

223
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:46,043
He came to ask for my advice.

224
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,283
What?

225
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,363
What wrong with you?

226
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:18,723
What was happened?

227
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:24,563
Is it about Eak?

228
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:33,803
It’s okay.

229
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:35,843
Can you tel me what was happens?

230
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,123
I don’t want to feel this anymore.

231
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:55,563
It...

232
00:23:57,363 --> 00:23:58,323
Eak Told me that

233
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:02,403
he not sure

234
00:24:03,963 --> 00:24:04,763
that he like woman

235
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:06,723
or men

236
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,683
And he asking me to wait.

237
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,443
How long do I have to wait?

238
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:29,403
I'm really heartbroken, First.

239
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,163
I don’t know

240
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:36,243
why he doing this?

241
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:44,523
Do you love him?

242
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:03,883
I don’t want to be like this anymore...

243
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,403
What are you going to do after this?

244
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:20,643
I think...

245
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:24,243
It looks like we won’t be able to go forward with him anymore.

246
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:29,323
I think I’m going to quit

247
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,243
and go study abroad.

248
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:39,163
Are you sure about this?

249
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:45,683
If it is...

250
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:50,483
I’m always ready supporting you.

251
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:08,963
What...

252
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,763
You heard me correctly.

253
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:16,363
This will be your last chance for you, Eak.

254
00:26:17,163 --> 00:26:18,523
This is all I can do to help you

255
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:00,203
Pee

256
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:01,683
You have to understanding me

257
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:03,163
I’m not ready to tell anyone.

258
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:05,243
Also,

259
00:27:05,243 --> 00:27:07,563
I’m not sure if I like guys or girls.

260
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,363
So what do you want me to understand?

261
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:13,643
If you feel good to me,

262
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:15,243
then just be with me.

263
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:16,443
But why...

264
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,763
are you trying to stop talking to me like this?

265
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:23,523
And who’s going to take responsibility for the feelings I gave you?

266
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:26,763
Let me tell you something,

267
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:28,763
every time he cries and gets hurt because of you,

268
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:31,163
I just want to punch you in the face to make you realize.

269
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:32,723
Come on, Do it now!

270
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,923
If you can’t take care of your partner like I take care of mine,

271
00:27:37,443 --> 00:27:38,923
then I think you should let him go.

272
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:43,163
Go reflect on yourself and figure out what you really want,

273
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,763
then come back and tell me.

274
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:46,963
But I can’t promise that I’ll wait.

275
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:50,523
He really love you.

276
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,363
He never once thought about betraying you, not even for a second.

277
00:27:54,443 --> 00:27:55,643
Go reflect on yourself first.

278
00:27:56,763 --> 00:27:58,243
be for you loosing him forever

279
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,563
This will be your last chance, Eak!

280
00:28:02,643 --> 00:28:03,763
This is all I can do to help you

281
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:46,117
How was your lesson with the teacher today?

282
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:47,477
Are you understand?

283
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,277
Understand!

284
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:50,757
Good job!

285
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:51,957
And...

286
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:55,517
Where is your parents taking you on the weekend?

287
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:58,757
My parents said they will take me to an amusement park.

288
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:01,997
But actually, I would prefer to go to Khao Yai.

289
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:05,757
But thy have already made a decision, so I can't disagree.

290
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:08,157
Nok, are you forgeting?

291
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:08,797
On the way back,

292
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:11,357
You can ask my parents to take me to an amusement park instead.

293
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:15,397
Teacher, I’ve already decided that I want to ride the Viking.

294
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:16,237
Oh wow!

295
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:18,117
That's great!

296
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:22,037
Aren’t you afraid? If it were me, I’d pass on that.

297
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:22,477
Ha ha ha ha

298
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:26,677
As for me, I’m going to the beach.

299
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,077
We're going to Bang Saen.

300
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:30,757
My parents like to take us there on weekends

301
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:37,317
At the end of the year, they said they will take me to Japan.

302
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:38,677
Wow!

303
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:41,117
I heard they’ve already booked the tickets.

304
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:43,597
As for me,

305
00:29:43,597 --> 00:29:44,917
I have dance classes

306
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,917
and singing lessons

307
00:29:47,397 --> 00:29:49,157
that my mom signed me up for.

308
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:49,917
But actually,

309
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,917
I would prefer to go to the beach like Pim.

310
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:55,277
Run!

311
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,597
Where will your parents take you?

312
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,037
Um...

313
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:11,637
Are you asking where Ryu is going to take you?

314
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:17,397
My bottle is empty, I'll go refill it for you.

315
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:26,957
I told you

316
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,517
not to bring this crazy kid

317
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:31,317
into my house

318
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:36,357
and make them a burden.

319
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:38,877
Are you sure

320
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:41,157
this is your sibling?

321
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:45,797
Do you really believe

322
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,157
it's my flesh and blood?

323
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:54,917
A kid like this,

324
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:56,677
if they keep avoiding things,

325
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,677
will only end up with a low life.

326
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:00,917
Dad!

327
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:03,757
The reason Narin died from a broken heart

328
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,517
is because of my father, right?

329
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:07,717
Me?

330
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:09,957
Do you know what?

331
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:14,637
Her mother isn’t exactly a good woman either.

332
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:18,197
I don't know how many men she's been with.

333
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,597
I’ve stopped contacting her.

334
00:31:26,597 --> 00:31:27,917
I’ve stopped giving her money,

335
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,437
that should be fair enough, right?

336
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,317
I’ll say it once.

337
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,717
You all need to get this crazy kid

338
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:40,757
out of my house as soon as possible.

339
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:52,917
Okay!

340
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:55,437
I’ll go with her!

341
00:31:57,757 --> 00:31:58,557
Hey, you.

342
00:31:59,197 --> 00:31:59,997
Ryu!

343
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:01,757
Are you trying to challenge me?

344
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:04,317
He has a brain tumor.

345
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:09,357
I don't know how much longer he can stay with you, Run!

346
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:13,157
Because of personal anger,

347
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:15,317
I’m ended up taking it out on you.

348
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:18,677
You didn’t do anything wrong. Ryu,

349
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,317
I’m sorry.

350
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:21,757
It’s my own foolishness.

351
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,517
I didn’t want it to turn out this way either.

352
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:09,197
Thank you.

353
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:26,397
Ryu!

354
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:31,357
Ryu!

355
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:38,117
Ryu

356
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:40,757
What are you doing here?

357
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,037
You know that toon...

358
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:43,357
What the hell are you doing at my house?

359
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:49,037
Coming to my house like this,

360
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,157
if you want to die so badly, you should have just said so.

361
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:52,077
Toon!

362
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:55,037
Clam down first!

363
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,917
I’ve been wanting to tell you something for a long time.

364
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:57,717
Shut the fuck up, Tin!

365
00:33:58,717 --> 00:33:59,917
THat’s great!

366
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:02,917
That you are here!

367
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,157
I don’t have to make it difficult for myself.

368
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,757
Toon!

369
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:06,797
It’s time for you!

370
00:34:08,157 --> 00:34:08,757
You going to die today!

371
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:09,917
You!

372
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:12,397
I’ll repay you for everything, both the principal and the interest.

373
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:13,917
Just be a ghost guarding my house.

374
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:15,997
Why are you stopoing me?

375
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:23,677
Are you pretending to be all tough?

376
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:25,597
Hum?

377
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:26,717
Wait for me!

378
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:31,677
Are you okay?

379
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:36,797
I'm going to kill you.

380
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:39,397
Hey!

381
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:39,917
Stop it!

382
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:40,797
Clam down!

383
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:41,597
Hey!

384
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:42,677
Get off me!

385
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:44,077
Stop it!

386
00:34:45,557 --> 00:34:46,077
Get off me!

387
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:47,237
Get off me!

388
00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:49,157
Let me go!

389
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:50,397
Let me go!

390
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,597
Let me go!

391
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,157
You're have to face bullets!

392
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:53,957
Let me go!

393
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:54,397
Stop!

394
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:54,837
Let me go!

395
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:55,317
I’m going to kill him!

396
00:34:56,037 --> 00:34:56,477
Let me go!

397
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:57,957
Let me go!

398
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:00,197
I’m going to kill him!

399
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,437
I’m here for you!

400
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:05,717
Tin

401
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:07,997
get off him.

402
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:10,397
I understand

403
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,117
How he feel.

404
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,037
Woo!

405
00:35:17,837 --> 00:35:18,637
A Hero!

406
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:21,837
But the hero can die at the end too.

407
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:22,597
Let’s me go!

408
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:25,637
Die today, then.

409
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:25,917
Stop!

410
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:29,957
If you don’t see me as a mother,

411
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,957
then I’ll die today along with Ryu.

412
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:34,717
Mom!

413
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:35,717
Mom!

414
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:47,397
Mom!

415
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,117
you're taking the side of the person who hurt me.

416
00:35:51,437 --> 00:35:52,477
If it weren’t for him,

417
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:53,917
our family wouldn’t have to struggle like this, Mom.

418
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:58,317
You do it youself!

419
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,517
All the terrible things that happened

420
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:05,677
were because of you.

421
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:10,117
The one possessed by a gambling addiction.

422
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:12,517
It’s you!

423
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:15,157
The one who embezzled from the company

424
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:17,317
It’s you!

425
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:22,597
Do you really not know,

426
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,117
or are you just pretending to be ignorant?

427
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:32,357
Everyone make mistakes, Mom.

428
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:36,357
If I didn’t go to jail, I could make money.

429
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:38,917
I can handle everything!

430
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,117
Why are you taking his side, Mom?

431
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:45,917
Stop blaming others already.

432
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:51,317
Stop barking and stop biting others like a crazy dog.

433
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:54,437
If we don’t have him...

434
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,117
Not even a place to rest

435
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:01,197
We won’t have it!

436
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:02,917
Do you understand?

437
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,357
What are you talking?

438
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,237
It’s him

439
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,237
who redeemed the house you mortgaged.

440
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:15,677
The house you mortgaged to pay off your gambling debt.

441
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,477
Don’t think that we don’t know.

442
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:22,717
"And when you were in jail,

443
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:25,797
the one who took care of the expenses and medical costs for Mom,

444
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,677
because she was heartbroken over you,

445
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:30,917
The one who helped find ways for us to make a living

446
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,157
and have income until today

447
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:34,117
is also him!

448
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:38,117
What the hell is this?

449
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:44,037
The reason Mom and I didn’t tell you about this

450
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:45,997
is because he asked us not to.

451
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:52,517
He didn’t want to bring up the past

452
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,557
so you could forget it faster.

453
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,437
But I never thought

454
00:37:56,557 --> 00:38:01,117
that when you got out, you'd end up like this—full of hatred,

455
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:02,957
thinking only about revenge.

456
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,117
If you’re going to be like this

457
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:10,517
and make Mom sad every day,

458
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:13,957
I think you should go back to jail.

459
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:22,597
Toon

460
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,317
you don’t have to overthink it.

461
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:29,557
Everything I did,

462
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:32,717
I did because

463
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:35,557
I felt like I was a part of it.

464
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,877
That led to that happening.

465
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:40,677
And the reason I came here

466
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:44,197
is that I just want to apologize to you.

467
00:38:59,077 --> 00:38:59,917
I'm sorry, Aunt.

468
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:05,397
I'm sorry, Toon.

469
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:20,717
You don’t have to do this.

470
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:25,077
It my false.

471
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:35,397
I let my anger cloud my judgment,

472
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:38,397
not realizing that I was wrong,

473
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:42,117
which ended up hurting the people I love.

474
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:04,997
I’m sorry.

475
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:14,997
Iet’s begin again.

476
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:17,877
I’m sorry, mom.

477
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:19,277
Sorry, Tin.

478
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:33,317
No matter what happens to me from now on,

479
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:35,717
there’s nothing I need to worry about,

480
00:40:36,877 --> 00:40:38,517
nothing that I owe or need to be indebted for.

481
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:41,917
From now on

482
00:40:42,397 --> 00:40:43,877
I hope you live a good life, Toon.

483
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:03,277
Good job.

484
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:07,397
Just take medicine, then it’ll be done

485
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:12,797
Why are you so kind to me?

486
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:15,597
I’ve treated you like this, aren’t you angry?

487
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:20,717
Listen!

488
00:41:21,557 --> 00:41:22,717
I'm not like this with everyone,

489
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:28,357
if that person...

490
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:30,397
isn’t you.

491
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:36,317
Just let go, little one.

492
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:38,517
Stop forcing it and let things happen naturally.

493
00:41:38,837 --> 00:41:40,557
Life is short.

494
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:42,117
Opportunities come,

495
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:44,917
but they might pass, and you can’t go back to fix them.

496
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:47,797
Heart disease isn’t hard to cure

497
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:50,117
just follow your heart.

498
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:02,717
Are you scared?

499
00:42:06,677 --> 00:42:07,477
You don’t have to be scared.

500
00:42:19,557 --> 00:42:22,157
Don’t worry, I’m right here.

501
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:38,997
Can you stay with me tonight?

502
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:59,157
The porridge has been delivered.
