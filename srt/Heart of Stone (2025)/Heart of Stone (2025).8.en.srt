00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,020
Su Mingyu,

4
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,670
why are you so foolish?

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,750
If you had been with me earlier,

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,000
we'd already be family.

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,030
Just hand over your shares to me,

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,240
and once I become chairman,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,200
I'll make you the chairman's wife.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,140
You wouldn't have to suffer like this.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,710
If we join forces,

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,390
Xiao Lang wouldn't stand a chance against us.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,990
Am I mistaken, or am I seeing things?

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,590
Mr. Li,

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,800
why are you in my room?

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,070
This… this should be my room.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,320
Then call the reception

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,920
and check if the room was booked under my fiancee's name.

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,560
Or should I

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,270
let everyone know what you just said?

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480

my favorite candy.

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,670
I secretly stuffed a lot into my pockets

while no one was looking.

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,510
I wanted to share my favorite things

with Zixing

64
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,110

Today,

67
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,630
Zixing was telling me

68
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,480
a story about a mermaid.

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,720
But suddenly, it started to thunder.

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,480
Don't be scared. I'll keep telling you the story,

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,160
okay?

when you're with me.

75
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,670
Who said you could touch my stuff?

76
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,350
You were so desperate to stay at my place.

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,080
So of course, I need to know your past.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,550
You're unbelievable, Xiao Lang.

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,870
You took over my house,

81
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,160
yet you suspect me of having ill intentions?

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Last night, you sent me to deliver a document,

83
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,350
and I was forced to drink.

84
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,670
I ended up passing out in the hotel.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,670
What?

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,840
Was this all part of your plan to invade my privacy?

87
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,310
First, I never asked you to deliver the document.

88
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,080
Second, I didn't force you to drink.

89
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,750

Xiao Lang!

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,430
Is this how you break off an engagement?

104
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,310

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,040
Isn't breaking off the engagement exactly what you wanted?

108
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,750
I should never have placed my hopes

109
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,110
on a devil like you.

110
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,230
This scheme of yours is utterly vile.

111
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,230

112
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,750
where this video came from.

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
If Li Ziyang is behind it,

114
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,160
tell Han Bin to fire him.

115
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,190

118
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,750
So this is the person you wanted to protect?

119
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,350
She was caught in a hotel with another man

120
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,480
in the middle of the night.

121
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Madam Man,

122
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
I'll keep my promise and call off the engagement.

123
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll cut ties with her.

124
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,480
But I also hope

125
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,790
you'll honor our agreement

126
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,550

128

you let your feelings cloud your judgment.

129
