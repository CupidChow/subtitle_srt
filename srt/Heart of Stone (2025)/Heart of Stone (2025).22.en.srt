that I will love you forever and always.

193

You keep coming to me

194

through the company.

198
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,710
That's right, Mr. Qin.

199
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,350
Are you willing to testify?

200
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,710
Your father gathered all this information before he passed away.

201
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,870
He was afraid something might happen to him,

202
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,230
so he entrusted it to me.

203
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,110
But these records implicate the entire company,

204

I'm afraid I won't escape punishment either.

207
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,400
Mr. Qin,

208
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,200
if we are guilty,

209
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,750
then we must take responsibility.

But if we are not,

211
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,230
I believe the police will conduct a thorough investigation

212
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,200
and ensure that no innocent person is implicated.

213
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,560
You're just like your father,

There's no way he's coming back.
