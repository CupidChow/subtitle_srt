[HEART OF STONE]

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,020
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,440
Su Qichao and Gao Rui conspired to kill my mother,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,510
stealing Zhizhen and everything that belonged to her.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,760
I won't let them get away with it,

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,710
nor will I show mercy to Su Mingyu.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,800
Xiao Lang!

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,110
What gives you the right to throw away my stuff?

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,200
You may own this house now,

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,880
but you agreed to let me stay.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,070
These are my personal...

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,960
Get this straight.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Everything here

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,070
is part of your father's debt repayment.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,920
Since it belongs to me now,

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
I'll keep what's valuable

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,240
and get rid of anything useless

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,920
whenever I want.

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,350
Everything in this box holds

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,470
my most cherished childhood memories.

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,320
What are you doing?

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,560
It looks like your childhood wasn't worth much.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,390
What are you doing?

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,390
I...

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,790
You!

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,590
You've gone too far!

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,920
Xiao Lang,

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,090
you have no feelings

29
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,950
and no shame!

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,350
Feelings?

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,480
You truly are Su Qichao's daughter.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,220
After taking everything from others,

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,870
you still dare to talk about feelings.

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,840
You're just as shameless as your father.

35
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,760
You're the shameless one!

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,230
You're absolutely right.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,760
I am shameless.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,280
It's the only way

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
to avoid getting hurt by people like you.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,470
Xiao Lang, I'm warning you.

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,960
Stay away from me!

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,430
Come on.

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,190
Keep hitting me,

44
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,910
and I'll keep kissing you.

45
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,750
Didn't you call me shameless?

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,840
Let me show you just how shameless I can be.

47
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,520
If I hadn't hardened my heart,

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,430
I wouldn't have survived until now.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,560
All of this is thanks to your father and Gao Rui.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,590
What bad luck!

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
Su Qichao finally died,

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
and now I have to deal with Xiao Lang.

53
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,960
Mom, look at how smug he is.

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,590
He doesn't seem like someone who can amount to much.

55
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,000
He's definitely not your match.

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,360
But right now, he's got the upper hand.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,430
How about I take this chance to win over Su Mingyu?

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,190
That way, she'll definitely support us.

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,630
How will you win her over?

60
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,190
By using your flirting tricks

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,470
in nightclubs?

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,560
Mom, don't say that.

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,120
I've got lots of tricks up my sleeve.

64
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,960
On the surface, Su Qichao seems

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,030
to have transferred all his assets to Xiao Lang,

66
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,080
and Su Mingyu is just a fallen heiress.

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,590
Don't do anything rash.

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,710
We can still make use of her.

69
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,400
Get someone to investigate Xiao Lang's background

70
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,080
and find his weaknesses.

71
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,870
There's no way

72
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,400
this nobody

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,750
can be my equal in Zhizhen.

74
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,470
You're acting all pitiful again.

75
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,240
What do you want?

76
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm asking you a question.

77
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,520
I've just finished cleaning these floors.

78
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,430
Mr. Xiao,

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,870
don't you have

80
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,680
any respect for other people's hard work?

81
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you think that by lowering yourself like this,

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,750
I'll go easy on you?

83
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,240
- I... - I made her do it.

84
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,270
We don't allow freeloaders in this house.

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,750
She can't just stay here for free.

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,040
We need a maid anyway.

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,070
She certainly should do something for this household

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,680
to repay what she owes us.

89
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,920
Before Zixing comes back,

90
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,830
will you help me guard this home

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,070
and wait for his return?

92
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,870
Zixing,

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
I know you'll be back.

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,120
Why are you in my room?

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,310
Your room?

96
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800
Everything here belongs to Xiao Lang.

97
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,800
Xiao Lang agreed I could live here,

98
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,600
and I've worked in return.

99
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,120
How can you be so arrogant while living under someone else's roof?

100
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,160
This is Xiao Lang's house.

101
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,870
What is this?

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,310
Hand it over.

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,510
- You took my dad's... - Su Qichao?

104
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,560
How dare you still keep his photo?

105
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,560
What are you doing?

106
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,430
Give me my dad's photo back.

107
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,800
What are you doing?

108
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,190
Su Mingyu!

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
I took you in out of kindness,

110
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,750
yet you dared to hurt Madam Man?

111
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,600
I'll stay here

112
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,750
and offer myself in exchange.

113
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,950
I'll gradually repay the money

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,310
my father owes you.

115
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,720
I've personally thrown out

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,120
what should have belonged to this house.

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,360
You can do whatever you want to me,

118
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,430
but please, I beg you,

119
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,720
don't touch these things.

120
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,190
If you want to stay here peacefully,

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,950
it's best to be obedient.

122
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,920
Madam Man.

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,950
Meizhen,

124
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,680
you were set up by them.

125
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
Not long after you were sent to the psychiatric hospital,

126
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,070
that two-timer

127
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,190
brought Gao Rui and her son into this house.

128
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,360
Gao Rui became even more arrogant,

129
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,120
stepping into the house as the new mistress.

130
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,370
- Xing - Let go of me!

131
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,120
- endured so much bullying - I am not sick at all!

132
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,060
- from Gao Rui and her illegitimate son. - You have no right to take me away!

133
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,740
Mom!

134
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,870
This is Xing's home,

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,830
and it's your property.

136
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,950
Let go of my mom!

137
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,070
Yet Xing endured so much torment here.

138
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,430
In this storage room,

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Xing was locked away,

140
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,750
alone for countless days

141
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,070
and nights.

142
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,510
He was so young

143
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,120
and terrified of the dark.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,200
How could she be so heartless?

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,910
Meizhen, don't worry.

146
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,750
Gao Rui and her henchman, Su Qichao, won't escape justice.

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,120
I'll make sure Xing holds onto his vengeance.

148
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,200
I'll witness him getting justice for you

149
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,360
and make sure these villains

150
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,320
face the consequences.

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Mom,

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,790
the investigation results on Xiao Lang are out.

153
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,320
He's definitely not as simple as your investigation suggests.
