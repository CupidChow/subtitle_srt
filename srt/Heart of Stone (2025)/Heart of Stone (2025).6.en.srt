killed your mother

I'm not entirely sure.

38

Didn't we agree to keep each other posted?

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,910
I can't believe Su Mingyu still dares to show up here.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,520
Isn't her family already...?

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,240
Didn't you know?

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,000

44
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,520

45

at someone else's place.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,030
This is beyond shameless.

47
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,560
She's quite something.

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,470
