[Heart of Stone]

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,020
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,640
Mr. Xiao,

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,550
bad news.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,390
The project manager of Jinhe Group, Zhang Chi,

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,160
is suddenly unreachable,

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,670
and he has transferred all our funds.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,600
So he ran off with the money.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,990
Without adequate funding,

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,960
the Garden Villa project

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,240
will suffer a cash flow crisis,

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,240
and the consequences will be dire.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,790
Compile a list of companies that have recently shown interest in collaborating

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,670
or investing in real estate

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,600
and bring it to me.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,480
Also, look into

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,710
Zhang Chi's background

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,920
and who he's met.

19
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,520
For something to go wrong at such a critical time,

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,240
there must be someone pulling the strings.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Yes, Mr. Xiao.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,480
Mr. Li may be a bit greedy,

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,240
but he sure gets things done quickly.

24
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,280
The Garden Villa's project manager has disappeared with all the funds.

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,350
In a few days, find a boat and send him away.

26
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,240
Xiao Lang must be like

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,960
a cat on a hot tin roof right now.

28
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,310
He's always made things difficult for us.

29
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,800
This time, we'll bring him down for good.

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,640
If Xiao Lang fails this time,

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,550
he will lose all his authority.

32
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,390
With the shares we hold,

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,670
along with those Su Mingyu entrusted to us,

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,030
we already have enough to take him down.

35
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,910
One more round of funding,

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,670
and we can remove him

37
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,910
from the chairman's position.

38
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,830
This is a rare opportunity.

39
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,670
[Haisheng Group has officially announced a 1 billion investment in real estate]

40
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,910
Haisheng Group?

41
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,720
Isn't that Mr. Jiang's company?

42
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,170
I've known Mr. Jiang for 20 years.

43
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,240
Plus, his daughter, Lisa,

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
is about the same age as you.

45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,440
If you two end up together,

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,030
it would bring our families even closer.

47
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,000
Haisheng Group's funds

48
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,310
would become our greatest support.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Then what about Su Mingyu?

50
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,360
We have all her shares,

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,880
so she can't stir up any trouble.

52
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,000
Then why keep her around?

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,910
Xiao Lang is deeply attached to her.

54
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,800
Until we take him down,

55
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,590
Su Mingyu remains a card we can play against him.

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,270
Mr. Xiao.

57
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,110
Mr. Xiao.

58
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,830
Mr. Xiao.

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,360
I hope I haven't disturbed your nap during work hours.

60
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,870
Looks like Gao Rui gave you quite the makeover.

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,480
Due to your major mistakes

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
in the Garden Villa project,

63
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,800
the board has unanimously decided

64
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,550
that I will take over all your work in the Design Department.

65
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,640
A board decision?

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,200
Gao Rui was behind this, wasn't she?

67
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,520
Su Mingyu,

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,710
is this the outcome you wanted?

69
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,270
I just want my father's company

70
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,040
to continue running smoothly

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,080
and not be ruined

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,710
by your personal mistakes.

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,800
Rui!

74
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,110
Mr. Xiao.

75
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,480
Assist Miss Su with the project handover.

76
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,240
Rui,

77
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,360
how did such a major mistake happen

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,150
in the Garden Villa project?

79
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,800
I need to know

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,670
the exact reason behind this issue.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,670
Be honest with me.

82
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,830
Miss Su,

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,710
did you have a meal

84
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,430
with Li Ziyang a few days ago?

85
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,640
Is this related?

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
The day after your meal

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,520
with Li Mingqi,

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,590
he met with Zhang Chi,

89
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,360
the project manager of the Garden Villa project.

90
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,520
Shortly after, Zhang Chi vanished with the funds.

91
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,520
This project's failure

92
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,520
does not only impact Mr. Xiao

93
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,710
but has also severely damaged the company's reputation.

94
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,390
To resolve the crisis,

95
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
Mr. Xiao has not slept in three days.

96
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
That Li Mingqi, the man you had dinner with,

97
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,550
is purely profit-driven.

98
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,920
He only cares about benefits

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,110
and never values old ties.

100
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,350
If Li Ziyang took you to have dinner with him,

101
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,550
there's definitely an ulterior motive.

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,480
The day after your meal

103
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,190
with Li Mingqi,

104
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,670
he met with Zhang Chi,

105
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,520
the project manager of the Garden Villa project.

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,990
Shortly after, Zhang Chi vanished with the funds.

107
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,920
Dad,

108
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,640
try the coffee I made.

109
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,400
You're being unusually nice today.

110
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,790
Just tell me what you want.

111
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Dad.

112
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,430
Check this out.

113
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,160
[Zhizhen Group. Company Overview]
You seem quite interested in Zhizhen Group.

114
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,870
Ms. Gao mentioned this,

115
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,640
but a billion is no small sum.

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,480
It must go to someone we can trust.

117
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,720
I can tell

118
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,790
that Li Ziyang has feelings for you.

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,960
It's not Li Ziyang I'm interested in.

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,600
It's him,

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,790
Xiao Lang,

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,520
the new chairman of Zhizhen Group.

123
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,230
He's not an outsider.

124
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,520
He's the best friend

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,670
I told you about from my years abroad.

126
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,600
He's young and full of potential.

127
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,280
If he became my son-in-law,

128
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,350
one billion would be nothing.

129
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,110
I'd invest three

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,720
or even four billion in him.

131
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,520
I heard from Ms. Gao

132
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,040
that they're in serious trouble at the moment.

133
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,110
Dad,

134
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
with you around,

135
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,430
there's no such thing as trouble.

136
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,400
Adding to success is easy.

137
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,670
What I want is to offer help in times of need.

138
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,840
Mom,

139
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,310
Zhang Chi is at the port now.

140
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,720
He'll set sail the day after tomorrow.

141
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,430
Don't talk about this at home while Su Mingyu is around.

142
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,920
It's fine, Mom.

143
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,430
She has no clue what any of this is.

144
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,600
Stay in touch with Lisa.

145
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,190
Now that she's back,

146
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,550
she'll definitely help her father run the business.

147
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,870
If you work together,

148
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,310
Xiao Lang will be out of Zhizhen in no time.

149
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,190
I know,

150
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,310
but she won't answer my texts.

151
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,640
Reach out to her again.

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
Could the company's crisis

153
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,430
truly be related to Ms. Gao and Ziyang?

154
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,870
Zhang Chi is at the port now.

155
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,040
He'll set sail the day after tomorrow.

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,670
Should I tell Xiao Lang about Zhang Chi?

157
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,230
Regardless of whether it's true or not,

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
it's a serious matter.

159
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,310
Xiao Lang,

160
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,520
it's been so long.

161
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,750
You've become even more dashing.

162
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,230
Let me take a good look at you.

163
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,640
Miss Su.

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Hello, Miss Su.

165
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,550
I'm Mr. Xiao's girlfriend.

166
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,280
You can call me Lisa.

167
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,790
Hello, Lisa.

168
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm your boyfriend's ex-fiancee.

169
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,430
So, she's the former fiancee of yours

170
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,640
who was all over the internet?

171
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,990
Mr. Xiao,

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,350
if there's nothing else,

173
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,400
I'll get back to work.

174
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,160
I'll let you both talk.

175
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,310
You've been using me as a cover all these years.

176
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,990
Haven't you turned away enough admirers?

177
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,720
I was just joking earlier.

178
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,190
By the way,

179
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,870
I saw the news about your engagement,

180
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,040
and right after that, her cheating scandal broke out.

181
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,750
Looks like your plan

182
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,310
is going quite well.

183
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,310
All right, back to business.

184
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,710
I looked into it for you.

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,880
The project manager

186
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,520
of the Garden Villa project who fled

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,400
has a daughter with a congenital heart condition.

188
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,190
The day before he disappeared,

189
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,430
he sent her abroad.

190
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,310
It's clear that someone was manipulating him

191
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,360
through his daughter

192
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
in an attempt to control you.

193
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,950
I currently have a billion in funds,

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,070
and many real estate companies

195
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,280
have their eyes on this money,

196
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,550
including your rival,

197
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,520
Li Ziyang.

198
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,550
Given the crisis you're facing,

199
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,670
investing in you would hardly be wise.

200
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,830
But without this money,

201
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,000
the Garden Villa project

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,550
will face massive compensation claims.

203
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,640
You'll be held responsible

204
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,670
and could even be forced out of Zhizhen.

205
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,760
I know.

206
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,190
That's why I wouldn't have come to you

207
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,160
unless I had no other choice.

208
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,950
I'll help you.

209
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,920
What's the condition?

210
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,040
There are no conditions.

211
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,240
Just reassure my dad.

212
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,950
As long as we pretend to be engaged,

213
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,360
you'll be considered one of us,

214
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,120
and everything will be fine.

215
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,120
Lisa,

216
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,190
I've always seen you

217
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,240
as my most important friend.

218
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,360
I can't take advantage of your marriage for my own benefit.

219
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,830
