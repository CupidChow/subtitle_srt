00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,950
Madam Man,

4
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,040
I've come to see you.

5
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,230
Back when my dad abandoned us,

6
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,350
I had only you and my mom by my side.

7
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,560
To both me and my mom,

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,710
you had long been like our closest family.

9
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,200
Eighteen years ago,

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,120
I should have drowned in that river,

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,590
but you...

12
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,120
you were the one who saved me.

13
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,870
When I lost my mom,

14
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,120
you took me in and raised me as if I were your own son.

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,230
Xing,

16
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,280
what's on your mind?

17
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,070
Madam Man.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,710
I made your favorite pigeon soup for you.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
Madam Man,

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,510
I'm cold and scared.

21
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,920
I miss my mom.

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,390
Don't be afraid.

23
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm here with you.

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,960
I'll stay by your side,

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,110
and I won't let those bad people hurt you again.

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,150
I'll protect you.

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,320
Madam Man,

28
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,200
I will be strong.

29
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,150
I want to grow up quickly,

30
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,800
so I can protect myself

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,960
and you.

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,270
Xing,

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,670
you're such a good boy.

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,640
I hope you grow a heart

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,110
as tough as stone,

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,430
so no one can ever hurt you again.

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,040
When you grow up,

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,150
you must avenge your mother.

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,360
Now, drink your soup

40
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,990
before it gets cold.

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,240
Madam Man,

42
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,870

you are like a mother.

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
But

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,430
I'm the one who brought this upon you.

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
One by one,

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,830
those around me have died because of me.

48
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,040
This is all my fault.

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,150
This vengeance

50
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,960
will not end until justice is served.

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
I will make them pay

52
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,550
for what they've done.

please don't do this.

You haven't eaten or drunk anything

59

I made you suffer twice the pain.

I was wrong.

From now on, don't let those who are gone cause you

75

I won't stop you from doing what you want to do anymore.

I'll also become stronger soon,

80

but you must stop

hurting yourself like this.

82
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,960
I truly can't bear to lose you again.

83

Although Ziyang was framed

84
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,080
and some issues occurred,

85
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
all his shares

86
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,830
have been transferred to me.

87
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,830
I am now the largest shareholder of Zhizhen,

88
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,560
and I've already reached an agreement with an overseas institution

89
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,270
to invest one billion in the company.

90
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,150
Therefore,

Your current status

of the former chairman,

but as the proxy for the current chairman, Xiao Lang.

103
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,030
It seems Xiao Lang is completely out of options.

104
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,520
He's made a clueless young girl

106
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
He's probably using you as cannon fodder.

Additionally,

113
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,200
these reports highlight financial discrepancies

Without my funds,

120
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,440

I'm no longer that gullible little girl.

I won't let you control me anymore,

124

what belongs to me and Zixing.

126
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,080

Rui,

128
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,590
find the evidence of Gao Rui's money laundering as soon as you can

129
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,590
and submit it to the relevant authorities.

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,960
I won't allow her to use Zhizhen

131
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
for illegal activities like this again.

132
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,960
Is that clear?

133

Consider this a warning.

134

If you don't back off,

135
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,680
you won't be so lucky next time.

What are you doing?

137
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,440
Just you wait.

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,110
Are you okay, Miss Su?

139
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,800

Mr. Xiao, Miss Su was followed by someone yesterday.

142

Did you see the person clearly?

143
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,680
I only saw a guy wearing a baseball cap

I can't let her continue taking risks.

147
