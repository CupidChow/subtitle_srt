26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,830
My father used to say

that wounds are a gift that helps us grow.

28
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,880
That's why I got into the habit

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,510
of tying bandages like a butterfly bow.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280

When I was little,

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,860
I used to bandage

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
my neighbor's wounds the same way.

37
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,000
This house was actually his.

38
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
I've been staying here all this time

39
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,670
just waiting for him to come back.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,510
I want you to pull yourself together

41
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,830
and watch as I reclaim everything

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,350
from the Su family, piece by piece.

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,630
Because all you see is personal gain.

44
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,000
But not everyone is like you.

45
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,760
Are you out of your mind again?

46
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,950
I must be out of my mind.

what should I do?

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
It turns out that after all these years,

51
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,230
Yu has been waiting for me to return,

52
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,280
yet all I have done is hurt her.

53
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,830
She never forgot me.

54
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,520
I really don't know how to face her now.

Mom,

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,080
these shares

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
were left to Su Mingyu by her mother before she passed away.

60
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,670
Su Qichao held them

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,280
on her behalf for twenty years,

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
so everyone assumed

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
they had been transferred along with everything else.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,960
However, when Xiao Lang acquired the company,

65
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,080
Su Qichao had already made arrangements.

66
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,840
There is a nominee agreement and notarized documentation

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,520
confirming that the shares

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,480
rightfully belong to Su Mingyu.

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
Xiao Lang has also acknowledged

70
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,640
that they are entirely separate from Su Qichao and his debts.

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
you even had me fooled.

73
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,290
No wonder Xiao Lang wants to get engaged to her.

74
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,310
Mr. Xiao, you wanted to see me?

75
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,160

don't want me to carry you into the wax museum,

you'd better get up now.

81

82
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,990
and you got dragged into it.

What exactly are you trying to do?

86

She just heard that we were getting engaged

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,790

You were the one who suddenly announced our engagement.

91

and the next, your fiancee.

93
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,740
Madam Man isn't happy about this engagement,

94
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,560
but did she ever ask me how I feel?

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,070
Because I'm not happy about it either!

the reason I'm keeping you around

98
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,120
is because I want your shares.

putting you on the spot in front of Ms. Wang from Dawang Construction,

but you still secured the contract in the end.
