00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,710
Come in.

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,760
What's the matter?

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,800
Has the trash in the study been cleaned up?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I just cleaned it up.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,150
The trash is all taken care of.

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,200
Come back

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
and take this with you.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,240
Healing ointment?

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,320
It hasn't been opened yet.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,390
Take it and do as you wish with it.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,600
Is it for my injury?

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,280
Give it back.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,000
Can he really be so kind?

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
What's going on in his mind?

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Please don't touch these things.

18

Mom,

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,510
the investigation results on Xiao Lang are out.

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,150
He's the illegitimate son of the owner of FK International Investment Bank.

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,920
He went abroad to study at the age of ten

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,150
and attended the prestigious Bridgeton University.

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,510
[Xiao Lang's background information]
He returned to the country at twenty-six.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,760
His social circle isn't complicated.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,710
I've had people look into his classmates and colleagues.

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,560
There's nothing suspicious.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,310
He's definitely not as simple as your investigation suggests.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,710
Since he joined the company, the new policies

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,760
he's implemented seem efficient on the surface,

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,230
but they're all designed to target me.

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,230
He's already ruined several of my projects.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
I can't let him continue this unchecked.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,120
Haven't you also snatched quite a few contracts from him?

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,120
What difference does that make?

35
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,510
He needs to be removed from the chairman position.

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,280
So, what's our next move?

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,710
Your next step is to win over Su Mingyu

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,030
and make her yours.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,030
Tonight is the banquet.

Let's go.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,000
Everyone,

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,400
I've just taken over Zhizhen.

43
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,710
I know

44
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,470
that you've all been dedicated to the company for many years.

45
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,520
That's why I've organized this family banquet to host you.

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,590
Let's enjoy the night to the fullest

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,430

Take care of our guests

Xiao Lang

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,470
is utterly despicable.

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
Now is the best time for us

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,630
to win Su Mingyu over.

58
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,710
We are the only ones she could turn to.

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,280
I'll wait for her over there.

60

Ms. Gao.

61
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,960
You've really been through a lot lately.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,430
I only found out after coming here

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,000
that your father even lost the house to Xiao Lang.

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,030
Xiao Lang is truly despicable.

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,400
Ms. Gao,

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,800
I have no home now.

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,520
I can only live under someone else's roof.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
I'll find a way to repay

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,910
what my father owed him.

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,750
This isn't a long-term solution.

71
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,400
Yu,

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,310
you should go back to the company.

73
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,870
With all the design awards you've won,

74
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,800
it's the perfect place for you to shine.

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,600
You're right, Ms. Gao.

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,270
I'd love to return to the company.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Could you help me?

78
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,160
I can work in the Design Department.

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,950
Yu,

80
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,070
I really want to help you,

81
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,190
but...

82
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,870
Ms. Gao,

83
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,040
I hate Xiao Lang.

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,390
He tricked my father out of all his shares

85
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,560
and even drove him to his death.

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
Look at the situation now.

87
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,480
Are you really willing

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,560
to let his power keep growing?

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,510
Compared to him,

90
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,800
I'd much rather see Zhizhen in your hands.

91
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll help you return to the company,

92
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,800
and in exchange, you keep an eye on Xiao Lang.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Let's work together, okay?

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,270
In a week, the board will meet

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,720
to decide whether Xiao Lang will officially take over as chairman.

96
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,750
I'll send you the names

97
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,830
of the five key board members later.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,480
All right now.

99
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,000
Ziyang is waiting for you downstairs.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,310
He's really worried about you.

101
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,270
Seeing what you're going through just now,

102
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,390
he was heartbroken.

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
Go see him.

104
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm going now, Ms. Gao.

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,190
I want both you and your son dead.

106
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,310
Ms. Gao.

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,870
Ms. Gao,

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,160
has this place changed compared to before?

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,120
I've seen enough of it already.

110
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,680
That makes sense.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,510
Word has it you lived here over ten years ago,

112
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,830
but ever since Zhizhen's chairman,

113
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,920
Shao Meizhen, had her accident,

114
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,390
you haven't set foot in this place.

115
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:10,970
What

116
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,920
are you afraid of?

117
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,430
No one likes an ominous house.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,720
I hope you'll be at ease here, Mr. Xiao.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
Gao Rui,

120
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,390
I've waited over a decade

121
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,430
to see my mother find peace again.

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,560
I will take back her company.

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,560
You and your son better be ready.

124
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,070
What's happening to Su Qichao and Su Mingyu now

125
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,390
will soon happen to you.

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,310
None of you can escape.

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,680
Ziyang,

128
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
Ms. Gao and I just discussed

129
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,680
my return to the company.

130
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,600
I'd like to join your Design Department.

131
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,680
Rest assured.

132
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,560
My mom will take care of everything.

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,510
Mr. Xiao, what's the meaning of this?

134
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,950
What's the meaning, huh?

135
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,690
Su Mingyu is my servant.

136
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,560
This is her working hours.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,680
Mr. Li,

138
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,160
if you want to catch up with her, you should check with me first.

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you have a problem with what I said?

140
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,390
I...

141
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
What are you doing?

142
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,920
Let go! Let go of me!

143
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,000
Let go of me, Xiao Lang!

144
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
What's wrong with you now?

145
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,160
Su Mingyu,

146
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,750
couldn't you see he was harassing you?

147
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,000
Or do you actually enjoy this?

148
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,800
Don't project your filthy thoughts onto others.

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,750
Su Mingyu,

150
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,190
you used to be a wealthy heiress,

151
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,560
so he treated you with respect.

152
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
But now?

153
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,800
To him,

154
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
you're nothing more than a pretty face.

155
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,510
Once you lose your value,

156
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,560
you'll just be a plaything.

157
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,390
Yes.

158
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,710
I no longer have the prestigious status

159
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,750
I once did.

160
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,830
So now, I'm just

161
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,160
a pretty plaything, pinned against the wall and humiliated.

162
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,390
Xiao Lang,

163
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,440
this is all thanks to you.

164
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,550
You deserve it.

165
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,750
Remember this.

166
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,390
You can only be

167
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
my servant.

168
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,910
Ms. Gao.

169
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,910
Gao Rui,

170
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
you stopped at nothing

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,030
to get what you wanted,

172
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,960
destroying Xing's family in the process.

173
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,120
After everything you've done,

174
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
you can still walk in here without a shred of guilt?

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,630
I'll make you pay for every last sin,

176
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,910
and I'll see to it that you, with blood on your hands,

177
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,630
suffer a fate worse than death.
