[Episode 15]

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,670
Then I'll get straight to the point.

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,960
Xiao Lang rejected my one-billion investment.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,790
Because my father wants us to marry.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,670
And the reason he refused

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,790
is because of you.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,150
Let me finish.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,470
In three days,

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,470
if Xiao Lang can't secure this funding,

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,150
the board will vote

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,560
to remove him as chairman.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm sure you understand the stakes.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,560
Right now, I'm the only one who can help him.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,150
Yet you handed over your leverage,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,880
the 10% shares that could save him,

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,600
to the very people who want to destroy him!

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,840
If it can help Xiao Lang,

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,880
I'll get the shares back right now.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,210
Get them back?

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,710
Xiao Lang was right.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,640
You really are naive.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,000
I've watched him fight his way to where he is now.

24
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,790
I know everything about his past.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,510
I know exactly what he wants.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,790
I'm the only one who can help him.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,560
But you staying by his side

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,560
will only hurt him.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
It will only bring him pain.

30
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,200
So, I'm asking you to step away.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,230
I would never hurt him.

32
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,560
He's my Zixing.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,000
I've waited for him for so many years.

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
How much do you even know

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,640
about our childhood memories?

36
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,430
You have no right to tell me to leave.

37
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,350
Zixing?

38
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,200
Do you know

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,920
why your Zixing became who he is today?

40
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,710
Do you know

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,790
why he had to return as Xiao Lang?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Because your father, Su Qichao,

43
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,950
personally killed his mother!

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,470
Because your father, Su Qichao,

45
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,150
personally killed his mother!

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,590
Zixing,

47
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,360
is this true?

And all this pain

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,470
was because of my father.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,360
How am I supposed to face you,

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,630
Zixing?

55
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,560
Is this my punishment from fate?

56
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,360
Ms. Meizhen, I'm sorry.

And you kept hurting me again and again!

I was thrilled.

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,950
But it wasn't because I wanted to reunite with you.
