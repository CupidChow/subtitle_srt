[Episode 24]

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,320
Yu?

4
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,510
Yu!

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,520
Yu!

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,240
Li Zixing,

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,560
let's see who holds out until the end.

8
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,440
Su Mingyu is in my hands.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,200
If you dare call the police,

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,880
you'll never see her again.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
You need to come alone.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,920
We'll settle old scores and new grudges.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,120
Gao Rui,

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,710
you kidnapped Yu.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,990
Oh, you're awake, huh?

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,230
Did I hurt you?

17
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,230
Gao Rui,

18
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,840
what do you want to do?

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,990
Let me go.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,350
Let me go and turn yourself in.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,490
You still have a chance.

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:24,990
Keep this up,

23
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,200
and you'll never be able to turn back, Ms. Gao!

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,270
Yu,

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,200
I watched you grow up.

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,270
I didn't want it this way.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,710
But your father forced me.

28
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,990
Li Zixing also forced me.

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,070
Now even you're forcing me.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,350
I have no choice

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,710
but to eliminate all of you one by one.

32
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,150
We didn't force you.

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,630
It's your own fault.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,040
You've done too many terrible things.

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
We just want you

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,630
to stop being so stubborn.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,070
Stubborn?

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,270
Your father used to nag me like this

39
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,880
for over ten years.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,760
It was so annoying.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,630
I had no choice but to make him shut up forever.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
What do you mean?

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,320
My father's illness

44
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,630
was because you did something to him?

45
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,480
I didn't do anything.

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,760
I just gave him a little medicine

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,880
to make his stroke worse.

48
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,830
Then I said a few things

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,350
that were enough to trigger him.

50
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,670
Dad...

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,650
Gao Rui!

52
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,110
How could you do this?

53
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,230
Don't cry.

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,950
I love to see you

55
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,830
looking so helpless.

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,110
It really makes me feel sorry for you.

57
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,280
Look at you,

58
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,720
so fragile,

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
still daring to fight me?

60
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,830
Where is your dear Zixing?

61
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,230
You've killed one after another.

62
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,280
Isn't that enough?

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,600
Let me go!

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,200
Don't try to use me to threaten Zixing.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,320
Let go!

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,830
Let go of me!

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,200
Shut up!

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
Do you see that?

71
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,280
If you take one more step,

72
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,230
we'll all be destroyed!

73
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,040
Yu, don't be afraid.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm here.

If you have guts, come at me!

78
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,630
Everything I've worked so hard for over decades

79
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,920
is gone just like that.

80
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,390
What do you want?

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,070
We can talk.

82
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,230
You still think you can negotiate with me?

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,430
Your lives are in my hands!

84
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,310
As long as I press down,

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,870
you'll both die!

86
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,790
At least this works out for you two.

87
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,230
You've been hating each other all this time.

88
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,990
Now you can be together forever.

89
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,110
Gao Rui,

90
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,870
as long as you let Yu go,

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,190
I'll give you all my assets.

92
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,870
Tell me what you want.

93
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,520
Now, even if you give me money,

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,670
do I have time left to spend it?

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
You still have a son!

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,280
Think about Li Ziyang.

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
He still has hope.

98
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,790
If something happens to you,

99
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,640
what will he do?

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
If I stop now,

101
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,870
will he have a better life from now on?

Everything I've worked for has been ruined by you.

105

I have no way out now!

106
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,280
Let Yu go.

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,600
As long as you let Yu go,

108

my life

109
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,310
can be yours.

Kneel down!

112
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,110
Fine.

This bomb gives you only three minutes.

I'll just watch

118
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,520
will you save your beloved

119
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,790

You've finally almost achieved your goal.

132

You have to bring your enemies to justice.

133

Don't die with me!

Revenge used to be the most important thing to me.
