00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,060
[Episode 14]

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,870
Mr. Xiao,

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,640
Gao Rui has notified

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,760
all board members overnight,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,120
accusing you of deliberately allowing Zhang Chi to escape at the port.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,100
They have decided

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,470
that if you fail to resolve

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,300
the Garden Villa project's funding crisis within three days,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,320
you will be forced to step down as chairman.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,880
All right, got it.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,560
What should we do next?

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,600
We'll talk about it at work tomorrow.

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,070
Did something happen?

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,320
Nothing gets past you.

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,430
Something big did happen.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,110
What happened?

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,860
From today on,

19
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,520
I may never again

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,280
be able to be that heartless Xiao Lang

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,870
in front of you.

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,790
You should totally win an Oscar for that act.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,320
Yu,

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,790
rest assured.

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,570
I'm no longer the timid

26
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,070
and fearful Li Zixing I used to be.

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,640
Don't worry about me,

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,070
and don't put yourself in danger for me.

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,640
Trust me.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I can handle anything.

31
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,920
Now that we're all here,

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,070
I'll get straight to the point.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,590
During his tenure as chairman,

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,150
Mr. Xiao made undeniable contributions

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,590
to the growth of Zhizhen Group.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,680
However,

37
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,990
due to the Garden Villa project,

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
he has inflicted massive losses on the group,

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,840
causing a significant cash flow disruption,

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,560
severe damage to our group's reputation,

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,120
and a sharp decline in stock prices.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,910
With that in mind,

43
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,910
I'd like to hear your thoughts

44
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,190
on whether Mr. Xiao Lang

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,240
should remain as chairman.

46
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,520
The issue is quite serious.

47
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,240
What's your opinion?

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,280
Let's see how things develop first.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,470
How did this happen?

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Ma,

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,470
I know it's not easy to commit

52
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,870
such a significant investment

53
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,150
to a project on such short notice.

54
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,840
However, you're surely aware of the promising future

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,470
of Zhizhen's Garden Villa project.

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
I have a call coming in.

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,080
We'll talk later. Let's leave it here for now.

59
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,470
Mr. An,

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,000
about Zhizhen's Garden Villa project

61
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,150
I mentioned to you last time...

62
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,910
Mr. Xiao,

63
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,150
we've worked together for a long time,

64
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,080
and we're not strangers,

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,190
so I'll be direct.

66
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,590
All investment firms have been informed

67
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,400
of the unexpected risks in your project.

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
As a result, Zhizhen's reputation has taken a hit,

69
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,960
and it has now been placed on the investment blacklist.

70
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,030
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
from Ms. Shao to Mr. Su,

72
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,910
you have all witnessed

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Zhizhen's steady growth into what it is today.

74
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,120
I believe none of us want to see the company

75
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,470
that Mr. Su devoted his life to building

76
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,960
fall apart in Xiao Lang's hands.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,240
For that reason,

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,590
I oppose

79
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,590
his continued tenure

80
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,030
as chairman.

81
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,630
By the way, I'd like to share some news.

82
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,360
You've probably heard that Haisheng Group

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,710
has recently announced

84
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,800
an investment of one billion

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,470
in the real estate sector.

86
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,150
I happen to be an old friend

87
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,960
of Mr. Jiang Min, Haisheng Group's chairman.

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,120
Moreover, his daughter, Miss Jiang Lisha,

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,150
and my son, Ziyang, share a deep bond,

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
and our families are considering a marriage alliance.

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,310
Naturally, this would pave the way

92
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,480
for a strategic partnership

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,130
and a strong collaboration

94
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,540
between Haisheng and Zhizhen.

95
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,560
I have every confidence

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
that under Ms. Gao's leadership,

97
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Zhizhen Group will reach new heights of success.

98
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,600
Lisa.

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,720
What brings you here?

100
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,190
Xiao Lang, are you all right?

101
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,120
I heard you were sent to the hospital.

102
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,390
Is your injury serious?

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,390
What did the doctor say?

104
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,160
Let me contact the best hospital now

105
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
and arrange a checkup for you.

106
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,390
No need.

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,950
I've fully recovered.

108
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,300
Take this.

109
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,630
What's this supposed to mean?

110
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,920
Right now, only the funds in my hands

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,560
can help you through this urgent crisis.

112
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,390
No one else can invest

113
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,400
in your project in such a short time.

114
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,600
Do you really expect to catch Zhang Chi and recover the money?

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,510
He's already fled

116
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,680
and won't show up anytime soon.

117
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,950
Lisa.

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,310
I can't take your money.

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,750
I appreciate your kindness.

120
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,190
Is it because of my father?

121
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,190
Listen,

122
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
I can delay

123
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,020
the marriage arrangement for as long as you need.

124
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,600
Once you sort out the company's issues,

125
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,720
I'll find a way to explain everything to my dad.

126
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,160
Even without all this,

127
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,800
I can't take advantage of your feelings.

128
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,190
Thank you.

129
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,000
Is it because of Su Mingyu?

130
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
There's just no reasoning with Xiao Lang.

131
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,310
I really don't get him.

132
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,950
Lisa.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,560
What is it?

134
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,510
