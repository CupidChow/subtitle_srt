00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,040
Zixing,

10
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,560
you're awake!

11
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,510
Does it hurt?

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll go call the doctor.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
It's okay,

14
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,480
I just want to take a good look at you.

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,400
You scared me to death!

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,230
Luckily, you're okay.

17
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm fine now.

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,840
Yu,

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,870
will you stay with me tonight?

20
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,560
Xing,

21
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,640
it's my fault.

22
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,520
I shouldn't have planted the seed of hatred in you.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,000
I shouldn't have pushed you onto this irreversible path.

24
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,960
If something happens to you,

25
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,800
then everything will have been meaningless.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,870
You must stay safe,

27
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,130
so I can face Miss Meizhen in the future.

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
Since it was my wrong decision,

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,310
I will be the one to end it.

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,640
Xing, you must be happy.

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,640
Don't worry, I'm here.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,240
I won't let Gao Rui hurt you again.

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,710
Why did you have to kill Meizhen

34
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,560
and her only son?

35
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,030
You destroyed her family.

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,120
You've already taken her company and everything.

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,750
Why did you still have to kill her?

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,540
The fact that you're both alive is my mistake.

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,950
If I had known today would be this troublesome,

40
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,760

What's the evidence you have

43
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,670
that I killed Shao Meizhen?

44
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,880
How much do you want me to pay for it?

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,000
You don't seriously believe

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,920
that everything in this world

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,720
can be bought with money, do you?

48
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,510
You did all those terrible things back then

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,230
just to make yourself

Yes,

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,000
so what?

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,070
Shao Meizhen was born with everything. Why her?

54
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,630
And me? Just a mistress living in the shadows.

55
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,320
Her son was spoiled and loved.

56
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,280
Of course, I will protect my son.

What can you do about it?

62
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,390
I can kill Li Zixing once,

63
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,760
and I can do it again.

64
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,510
If you dare go against me again,

65
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,630
I'll make sure neither of you

You're threatening me?

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,670
I was just making up stories.

69
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,280
A recording can't be used as evidence in court.

70
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,520
Gao Rui found me

71
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,750
and had me forge a medical record.

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
At that time, I was in debt,

73
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,920
so I agreed.

74
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,480
I didn't expect that she would use that fake record

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,430
to put Shao Meizhen

76
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,600
in a mental hospital.

77
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm willing to stand up as a witness.

79
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,050
Let go of me!

80
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,350
Zixing, go back!

81
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,920
Let go of my mom!

82
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,790
I'm not the only one who's been bribed.

83
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,750
You...

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
A recording might not be proof,

85
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,310
but we have witnesses.

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,640
We found the transfer records

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,870
you made to the attending physician.

88
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,480
We also found

89
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,550
Meizhen's diagnosis records.

90
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,280

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Otherwise, I'll make you lose everything!

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,640
Fine.

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
I promise you.

96
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,920
But what if...

97
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,870
As long as you follow through,

98
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,550
I will keep this secret as well.

99
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,110
Why is Xiao Lang still alive?

100
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,310
Useless! All useless!

101
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,350
I've given you enough time.

102
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,920
You were so sloppy in your actions.

103
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,670
So many of your secrets

104
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,160
are in the hands of a servant.

105
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,840
I told you this is your last chance.

106
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,430
Remember, either they die,

107
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,920
or you die.

An accident?

113
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Is she badly hurt?

114
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,310
Madam Man...

115
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,110

Mr. Xiao.

118
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,750
What did you say?

119
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,280
What happened to Madam Man?

120
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,550
Rui said...

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,670
Madam Man was going to fix the garden

122
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,670
and was waiting for you to come home.

123
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,790
She won't have time to come over.

124
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,350
Rui,

125
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,520
I'll ask you again.

126
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,310
What happened to Madam Man?

127
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Mr. Xiao, please calm down.

128
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
The police are already investigating.

129

Your injuries aren't healed yet.

154

You can't hurt your body like this.

155
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,040
I don't care!

156
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,710
The day I got into trouble,

157
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,950
Madam Man saved me.

158
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,590
Compared to what she did for me,

159
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,590
this is nothing.

160
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,000
Yu,

161
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,120
ever since Mom passed away,

162
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,520
Madam Man is the only family I have left.

163
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,710
She gave me a home, just like Mom did.

164
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,950
I'm going to kill those people

165
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,660
to avenge Madam Man!

166
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,280
Zixing,

167
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,190
I know...

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,880
But you can't just ignore your health like this.

169
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,470
If Ms. Meizhen and Madam Man knew,

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,040
they'd be upset too.

171
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,430
You don't want them

172
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,160
to see you like this from above, do you?

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,310
Yu...

174
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't have Madam Man anymore...

175
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm here.

176
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,280
