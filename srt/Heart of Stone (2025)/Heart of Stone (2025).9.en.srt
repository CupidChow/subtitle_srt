[Heart of Stone]

00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,020
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,240
Zixing.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,560
Xiao Lang, you're Zixing, aren't you?

5
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:50,790
Su Mingyu,

6
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,390
you're getting craftier by the day.

7
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,430
What act are you putting on now

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,920
to avoid breaking off our engagement?

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,030
Li Zixing.

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,520
You got that scar on your chest

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,680
when you were ten

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,590
after breaking the fish tank.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,920
I was the one who bandaged it for you,

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,630
but because it wasn't treated in time,

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,710
it left a scar.

16
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,070
I recognize that scar.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,350
Now that you're back,

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,960
why didn't you tell me sooner?

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,070
Su Mingyu,

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
I don't know

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,700
when you noticed the scar on my chest

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,120
and came up with such a story.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,920
I grew up training as a gladiator abroad.

24
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,270
This is just one of my many scars.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,150
Would you like to make up a story

26
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,070
for each of them?

27
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,350
Su Mingyu,

28
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,350
just because I negotiated with you once

29
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,040
doesn't mean you can push your luck with me.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,670
Mom,

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,760
why did you wake me up so early?

32
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,280
You leaked the surveillance footage

33
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,550
and fabricated rumors about Su Mingyu's affair.

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,550
But Xiao Lang uncovered the truth.

35
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,720
Now he's using Mr. Han

36
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,390
to get you fired.

37
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,480
Mom,

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,070
have you already figured out a solution?

39
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,630
Xiao Lang is clearly targeting us.

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,550
Since Han is so eager to step up,

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,110
I'll make an example of him.

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,790
He's not clean either.

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,350
Those records of his kickbacks

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,510
might just come in handy.

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
Spend more time with Yu.

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,830
She needs you now more than ever.

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,790
Mom,

48
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,040
I knew I could count on you.

49
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,880
Have you heard?

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,230
Mr. Han, who worked under Mr. Xiao,

51
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,110
attempted to fire Mr. Li Ziyang,

52
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,760
who oversaw the hotel's business operations,

53
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
over the leaked hotel surveillance footage.

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,830
But guess what? He got exposed instead.

55
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,000
His team had been taking kickbacks for years,

56
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,040
and they were all dismissed.

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,880
Oh, my.

58
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,600
This time,

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,230
the war between Mr. Xiao and Ms. Gao

60
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,720
has officially gone public.

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,160
- Miss Su. - Hi, Miss Su.

62
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,960
Time to work.

63
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,870
If Xiao Lang really is Zixing,

64
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
why won't he admit it?

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,350
Why is he keeping it a secret?

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I must find proof of his true identity.

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,840
Mr. Xiao,

68
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,720
I got you the latest coffee on the menu,

69
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,190
the Peanut Oat Latte.

70
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
Please give it a try.

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,790
Got it.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,110
Please try it.

73
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,480
If you don't like it,

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
I can get you something else.

75
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,480
Just leave it on the table.

76
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,230
I'll drink it later.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,600
All right.

78
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,960
Su Mingyu is trying to test me.

79
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,720
If he truly is Zixing,

80
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,670
he'll surely stay away from peanuts.

81
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,280
She still remembers my peanut allergy.

82
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,670
Miss Su,

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,670
are you here to see Mr. Xiao?

84
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,740
Not really.

85
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,480
Mr. Xiao,

86
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,480
this full-scale cleanup...

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,400
Drink the coffee.

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,840
Finish it.

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,750
Don't worry. It's not poisoned.

90
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,480
Mr. Xiao,

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,840
may I have a sip of your coffee?

92
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,430
Sure.

93
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,110
Please continue.

94
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,990
This cleanup

95
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,600
didn't lead us to Gao Rui's people,

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
but we've confirmed

97
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
she's engaged in illegal activities through company operations.

98
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,920
However, Li Ziyang has erased

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,190
all traces of evidence,

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,350
leaving the financial records flawless.

101
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,110
Keep an eye

102
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,600
on the overseas companies she's been using for fund transfers.

103
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,600
If she makes a move, she's bound to leave a trail.

104
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,280
All right.

105
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,110
It's a pity. We wanted

106
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,550
to get rid of Li Ziyang this time,

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,550
but we ended up losing Mr. Han as an ally.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,350
It's just a dog-eat-dog fight.

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Saves me the trouble of cleaning house.

110
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,040
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

111
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,400
word has it that Li Ziyang is acquiring shares

112
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,400
of Zhizhen Group on the market.

113
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,670
If they manage to take over Mr. Han's projects too,

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,430
they could end up calling the shots at Zhizhen.

115
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,480
Don't worry about it.

116
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,840
They won't get their hands on any shares.

117
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,720
Keep focusing on tracking

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,920
the source of Gao Rui's funds.

119
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,870
Yes, Mr. Xiao.

120
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,720
Also,

121
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
keep a close watch on Li Ziyang

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,310
and Su Mingyu.

123
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,350
Su Mingyu holds some of our shares.

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
If they fall into the wrong hands,

125
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,670
it could be troublesome.

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,600
All right.

127
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,920
Let's go.

128
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
We're off, Miss Su.

129
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,840
See you tomorrow.

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,350
See you tomorrow.

131
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,110
Why are you still here?

132
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm your assistant,

133
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
so I should wait until you're off work before I go.

134
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,310
I still have a project to handle.

135
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,160
You can leave now.

136
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,620
Mr. Xiao,

137
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,840
according to Rule 4 of the Assistant Guidelines,

138
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,790
I must stay by your side at all times during work hours.

139
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,480
Mr. Xiao,

140
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,230
we are truly honored by your visit

141
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,480
to inspect the port renovation.

142
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,110
We look forward to finalizing our collaboration.

143
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,870
Zhizhen Group

144
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,840
places great importance on the port renovation project.

145
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,550
Today, I have personally witnessed

146
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,550
the capabilities of your team, Mr. Sun.

147
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,520
Looking forward to a fruitful partnership.

148
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,310
Likewise.

149
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,280
Mr. Xiao,

150
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,310
let's go check that area out.

151
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,920
This way, please.

152
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,160
Zixing, I'm sorry.

153
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,080
This is the only way.

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
I must verify your identity.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,640
Su Mingyu!

156
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,520
Su Mingyu!

157
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,670
Help!

158
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,520
Help!

159
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,310
Is anyone there?

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,180
Su Mingyu!

161
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,290
Su Mingyu!
