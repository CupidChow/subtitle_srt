[Episode 19]

3
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,920
Yu, how should I face you now?

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,000
You were once the person who treated me the best.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,510
But after I returned, I hurt you so much.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,760
Mr. Su kept watch over this house for me,

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,960
yet I misunderstood him all these years.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,150
How could I ever forgive myself?

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,240
My shamelessness,

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,960
my cowardice,

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,350
and my stubbornness

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,240
remind me every moment

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,750
that I don't deserve your love again.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,520
Zixing,

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,960
we've been through so many life-and-death situations together.

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,110
All those past things are gone now.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,370
Can you forget them, please?

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,430
And I believe—

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,310
Dad made me wait all these years for you...

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,150
Now that he sees you by my side,

21
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,430
he must be at peace.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,430
He won't blame you.

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,120
Hatred kept me going for eighteen years.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,350
I even forgot for a while

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,950
that you were once the most important person to me.

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,950
My obsession with revenge for eighteen years

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,870
now seems to have been all wrong.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,950
In fact, all of this is a good thing for us.

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,760
I don't have to dwell

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,430
on the pain Dad caused you anymore.

31
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,400
You don't have to cling to hating him either.

32
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,640
But I've hurt you so many times.

33
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,560
With my excessive attitude,

34
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,560
my hurtful words,

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,400
and my unreasonable actions,

36
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,760
I hurt someone...

37
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,680
I should've been protecting the most.

38
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,200
I want you to live well.

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,000
And little by little,

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,430
watch me take everything you had from the Su family.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,910
Don't look at me like that, all pitiful.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
This is all your father owes me.

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,000
He can never repay it.

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
You'll pay it back instead.

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,960
I no longer have

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,310
the glamorous identity I once had.

47
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,000
So now, I'm just a vase

you were very good to Zixing.

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
But I was blinded by hatred.

You've been waiting for him to return,

Xiao Lang is actually

Shao Meizhen's son, Li Zixing.

116
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,430
What?

117
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Didn't you say you already took care of them?

118
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,680
Mr. Qian, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
It was my mistake.

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
But,

121
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,920
back then, it was all for your business.

122

To secure Zhizhen Group,

123
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,190
I had to take action against them.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,310
Now he's back to get revenge on us.

125
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,630

126
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,360

128
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,630
After we deal with him,

129
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,480
you need to restore the business as quickly as possible.

130
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,630
Don't worry.

131
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,000
I promise,

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,120
Zhizhen Group and all the companies under me

134
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,830

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,390
and listen to your orders.

139
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,950

140

144
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,870
Do you remember when we were kids,

145
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
we used to ride bikes here?

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
We rode from one end to the other.

147
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,870
Of course, I remember.

148
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,240
Teaching you to ride was no easy task for me.

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,870
You dare to say that?

150
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,040
Back then, you said you'd protect me from behind.

151
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,600
Then, when I rode so far ahead and turned around,

152
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,430
I found you had already let go.

153
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,480
Yu,

154
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,120
you couldn't learn because you were scared.

155
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,430
You just need to overcome that fear inside you,

156
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,480
and you can do anything.

157
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,950
Now, I'm not afraid of anything.

158
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
But you have to promise me,

159
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,480
no matter what,

160
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,950
you must never let go of my hand again

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,160
in the name of protecting me.

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,310
I promise you.

163
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,870

167
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,870
Give me a little more time.

168
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,750
I'll organize all the data and send it to you soon.

169
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,720
Alright, Ms. He.

170
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,480
Don't alert the enemy.

171
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,360

Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,720
I'll update you as soon as there's progress.

176
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,720
It's nothing.

With me here,

181
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,560
everything can be solved.

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,360
I've already taken care of the financial director

183
