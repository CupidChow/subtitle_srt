00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,020
[Episode 23]

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
Su Mingyu,

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,960
there's been no progress on these deficits for so long.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,480
The fact is,

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,960
you're not fit for managing the company.

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,510
You should step down as soon as possible.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,470
Ms. Gao,

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,390
aren't these bad debts

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,120
all created by you personally?

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,990
I didn't expect you to have run out of tricks

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,880
and reached this point.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,520
You're completely disregarding the company and the board's interests.

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,030
Do you have any proof?

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,120
Don't even say it's you,

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,160
not even Li Zixing could do anything to me if he came back.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,390
Gao Rui!

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,710
You've done everything wrong.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,440
Aren't you afraid of the consequences?

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
All the shareholders present

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,150
have transferred their company shares

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,040
to me.

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,400
I now own 60%

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,680
of the company shares,

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,600
giving me absolute say.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,870
- Hello, Mr. Xiao! - Hello, Mr. Xiao!

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
How is this possible?

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,230
How dare you?

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,270
Gao Rui,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,230
wait and see, your judgment is coming.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,560
This is the evidence of you and your son, Li Ziyang,

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,870
using the company for money laundering over the years.

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,630
Also, twenty years ago,

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,710
when you wanted to take Zhizhen Group,

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,630
you locked the then-chairman Shao Meizhen

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,040
in a mental hospital

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,070
under the pretense of a mental disorder.

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,230
You forced her to sign the transfer agreement,

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,070
then mercilessly murdered her.

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,790
You didn't even spare her young son.

41
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,630
You pushed ten-year-old me into the river.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,320
I've already handed all the evidence to the police.

43
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,720
Gao Rui,

44
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,160
I actually worked with someone like you!

45
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,320
Fine,

46
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,720
just you wait.

47
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,720
Zixing,

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
I hope Ms. Meizhen,

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,280
Madam Man,

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,880
and my father

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
will be satisfied with this result.

52
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,390
They definitely will.

53
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,790
But this isn't the final result.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,440
Why?

55
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,110
Our final result is to reunite

56
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,600
and never part again.

57
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,480
He's getting up so early.

58
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,550
Hello?

59
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,790
Miss Su,

60
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,790
Mr. Xiao is in trouble!

61
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,870
What happened?

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,310
He's injured.

63
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,520
I'll send you the location.

64
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,550
Hurry, go find him!

65
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,230
Zixing!

66
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,570
Li Zixing!

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,430
Yu!

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,670
Where are you hurt?

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,350
I'll take you to the hospital.

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,080
Here.

71
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,310
My heart has been hurt time and again.

72
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,870
But it's your love

73
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,110
that has healed my wounds over and over.

74
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,920
Can you stop joking

75
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,110
with your own safety?

76
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,520
I was so scared running here.

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,600
Since you're so worried about me,

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
can you keep your promise?

79
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,430
I'll let go of all my hatred,

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,520
and you...

81
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,110

my life was all about revenge.

I peeked at your wish list.

117
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,790
The first wish

118
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,230
was to watch the sunset on the beach.

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,280
So, I proposed to you at the beach.
