[Episode 18]

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,670
Get the best lawyer.

4
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,320
You have to get Ziyang out for me.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,670
Keep a close eye on Xiao Lang.

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,640
If anything happens to Ziyang,

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
no one around Xiao Lang will be spared.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Got it, Ms. Gao.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,880
I'll contact the lawyer right away.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,070
Wait.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,960
Carefully check all the financial documents Ziyang has handled.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,880
There must be no errors.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,710
Got it, Ms. Gao.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,280
Rui,

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,120
ever since I came back,

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,350
you've been following me.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,950
Can you give me some time alone?

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,310
Sorry, Miss Su.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,840
Mr. Xiao asked me to stay by your side at all times.

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,400
Even so,

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,120
you shouldn't stay right next to me.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,280
Step aside.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,510
Miss Su, please don't make things difficult for me.

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,150
I really can't do it.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
Xiao Lang neither lets me go out

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,310
nor allows me to work,

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,760
and he has you follow me every day.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,430
Is he up to something?

29
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,590
I have no idea.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,280
Fine.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,120
Then I'll go for a walk in the garden.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,870
Xiao Lang.

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
You're back.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,910
Let me tell you.

35
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,520
When I was little,

36
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,520
after we moved here,

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
I would often sit here waiting for you.

38
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,710
Every single day, I would watch that entrance,

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,400
and whenever I saw a child passing by,

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,870
I would think it was you coming back.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
I'd happily run over,

42
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,470
only to find out it wasn't you.

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,310
I promise

44
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll come back to you

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
as soon as I get off work.

46
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,400
You're only going to get busier

47
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,710
and keep working late.

48
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,520
In case you think otherwise,

49
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm not waiting for you.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840
Don't worry, it'll be over soon.

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,030
Once I find evidence of Gao Rui's crimes

52
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,030
and kick her out of the company,

53
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,360
everything will be settled.

54
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,120
Then, we'll go on a trip

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,120
to see the lavender fields in Provence,

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,710
the Northern Lights in Iceland,

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,150
and the Bridge of Sighs in Venice

58
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,240
before it disappears.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,840
All right.

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,290
Who are you?

61
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,210
Why are you in my house?

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Gao Rui, it's been a while.

63
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,120
Who exactly are you?

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,510
Man.

65
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,070
It's you.

66
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,680
How dare a mere maid like you barge into my house?

67
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,830
From now on, this is my house.

68
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,830
You didn't know, did you?

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,630
Li Ziyang used it as collateral for a loan,

70
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,430
and I'm the lender.

71
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,950
Since he didn't pay it back on time,

72
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,600
everything here

73
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,360
is now mine.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Nonsense!

75
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,360
How could you possibly have that much money?

76
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,950
Are you in cahoots with Xiao Lang?

77
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,680
What's your relationship with him?

78
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,920
Xiao Lang is the person you pushed into the river all those years ago.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,310
Li Zixing?

80
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,720
You didn't see this coming, did you?

81
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,720
I saved him.

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,360
I couldn't save Miss Meizhen,

83
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,040
but I did save her son.

84
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,920
We've returned this time

85
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,000
to take back everything you and Su Qichao

86
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,240
stole back then.

87
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,310
Everything we stole?

88
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,120
No wonder the moment Xiao Lang returned,

89
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,190
he seized all of Su Qichao's assets

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,390
and drove him to his death.

91
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,950
Su Qichao,

92
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,190
after over a decade,

93
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,720
the very person you tried so hard to save

94
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,070
only sees you as his enemy after coming back.

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,720
Su Qichao,

96
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,390
now that you're buried underground,

97
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,310
can you see this clearly?

98
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,310
What do you mean?

99
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,130
Didn't you and Su Qichao

100
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,140
conspire to harm Miss Meizhen?

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
I was the one who killed Shao Meizhen.

102
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,190
Gao Rui,

103
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,400
please spare my son and me.

104
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,560
You already have my husband,

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
and I've agreed to give you the house and the company.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
How could I possibly leave any loose ends?

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
Everything belongs to me now.

108
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,390
I want you dead!

109
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,630
I want both you and your son dead!

110
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,750
If you dare lay a finger on my son,

111
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,190
I'll haunt you even in death!

112
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,120
Then go ahead and die!

113
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,270
Mom, I'm back!

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,360
Mom.

115
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,610
Wake up.

116
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,270
Mom.

117
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,630
Mom.

118
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,190
- Ms. Shao! - Mom.

119
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,430
Gao Rui,

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,390
how can you be so cruel?

121
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,950
This is murder!

122
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,720
Shao Meizhen's death

123
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,120
benefits you the most.

124
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,360
Su Qichao,

125
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,270
if you want a share of the company too,

126
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,720
just sit tight

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,800
and wait until Ziyang's father takes his last breath.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,870
Then, you and I will take control.

129
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,480
Think it over carefully.

130
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,190
When I pushed Li Zixing into the river back then,

131
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,950
Su Qichao actually wanted to save him.

132
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,870
How ridiculous.

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,680
Zixing!

134
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,950
Zixing!

135
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,680
Zixing!

136
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,070
Gao Rui,

137
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,800
I can't believe you would even go after

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,750
a ten-year-old!

139
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,960
Am I supposed to raise him into an adult

140
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,550
just so he can take revenge on me?

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,150
Su Qichao,

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,910
don't be so naive.

143
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,480
He witnessed

144
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,960
Shao Meizhen's death.

145
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you really think

146
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,480
he won't come back for revenge once he grows up?

147
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
Even if he hates me,

148
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,840
I want him to live!

149
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,600
Su Qichao fought back countless times,

150
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,270
but what was the use?

151
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,910
He had no evidence at all.

152
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,750
A little public opinion orchestrated by me was enough to destroy him.

153
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
All these years,

154
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,720
he kept opposing me in the company.

155
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,440
I couldn't wait for him to die!

156
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,910
And thanks to you, I got what I wanted.

157
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,200
You wicked woman!

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,870
I'll make you pay!

159
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,270
What can you possibly do?

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,960
Mark my words.

161
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,670
I killed Li Zixing once,

162
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,480
and I can do it again.

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,390
If you dare keep going against me,

164
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,320
I'll make sure both of you

165
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,720
meet a miserable end!

166
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,600
If you dare harm Xing,

167
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,200
I'll haunt you even in death!

168
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,720
You and Shao Meizhen shared such a deep bond.

169
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,960
She once said the same thing to me.

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,480
But look at me.

171
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,390
I'm still here, living just fine.

172
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,790
Before I decide to kill you too,

173
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,320
get out of my house!
