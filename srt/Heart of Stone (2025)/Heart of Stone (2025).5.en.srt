[Episode 5]

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,120
Xing,

4
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,870
if you can't persevere

5
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,120
on this path of revenge,

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,070
I'll remove the obstacles for you.

7
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,950
Madam Man, Yu…

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,840
Su Mingyu is still useful to us.

9
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,150
Su Qichao and Gao Rui colluded

10
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,430
to harm your mother.

11
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,510
Su Mingyu must have been sent by Gao Rui.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,430
She's watching your every move

13
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,280
at home and at the company.

14
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,710
You must be careful

15
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,120
and not let her deceive you.

16
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,920
Rest assured.

17
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,480
The election for the new chairman is just around the corner.

18
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,950
I will reclaim Zhizhen Group,

19
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,590
which rightfully belongs to my mother.

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,920
Everything they owe her,

21
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,760
I'll make them repay tenfold.

22
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,710
I promise.

23
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,750
Han Zhuang, Li Mingqi, Zhao Shude,

24
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,000
Wang He, and Qin Li

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
are all shareholders

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
with voting rights in the company.

27
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,800
They have old ties with your father

28
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,630
but no direct conflicts of interest with you.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,560
If you ask, they will support you.

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,630
You must convince them

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,470
to oppose Xiao Lang's appointment.

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,410
- Understood. - Miss Su.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,430
Since when did you become Ms. Gao's assistant?

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,150
It's just standard work instructions.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,190
Surely you don't mind, Mr. Xiao?

36
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,030
Su Mingyu,

37
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,280
I have personal plans today.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
You don't need to follow me.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,870
I'm counting on you, Mr. Li.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,150
Don't worry, Yu.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,630
Your father and I were best friends.

42
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,840
I need to think it through before I vote.

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,470
This is non-negotiable.

44
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,430
I'm really sorry,

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
but I can't help.

47
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,520
I can't agree to that.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,560
How could I possibly let Xiao Lang

49
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,750
seize the company

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,400
your father built with a lifetime of hard work?

51
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,870
Thank you.

52
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,650
This election is of great importance

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,190
and concerns the company's future development.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,080
I can't agree to it just based on

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,710
a few words from you.

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,470
This is no trivial issue.

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,240
Mr. Qin,

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,850
I've been waiting here for you all day.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Back when you were caught

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,560
in a debt crisis,

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,960
I wonder if my father ever made you wait this long.

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Miss Su,

63
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,190
didn't I tell you to get off work on time?

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,150
But you still showed up to pick me up.

65
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm done.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,470
We can go now.

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,800
Pleasure working with you.

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,470
Mr. Qin,

69
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,520
please help me.

70
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,380
Do you really want me to step down that badly?

71
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,240
Even if you tricked my father out of all his shares,

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,240
you are still unworthy of managing Zhizhen.

73
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,920
Besides Gao Rui,

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
which of your father's old friends

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,390
is willing to help you?

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,630
What are you doing?

77
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,390
Let go of me!

78
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,430
Such is human nature.

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,270
When someone falls on hard times,

80
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,750
others only kick them while they're down and take advantage of their weakness.

81
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,190
You expect someone to lend a helping hand,

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,430
but all they care about is their personal gain.

83
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,190
That's just what you think

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,070
because all you see is personal gain.

85
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,120
But not everyone is like you.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,800
There are surely people in this world who believe

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,630
that loyalty is the most precious thing,

88
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,390
something truly worth fighting for.

89
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,470
Yes, personal gain can sway people,

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,510
but it will never earn true loyalty.

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Loyalty?

92
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,120
How laughable.

93
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,600
Who in this world is truly loyal?

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,360
Me.

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,510
Naive.

96
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,390
Regarding

97
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,480
Mr. Xiao Lang's official appointment as the Chairman of Zhizhen Group

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,920
after his trial period,

99
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,720
those in favor, please raise your hand.

100
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,870
Congratulations to Mr. Xiao Lang

101
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,750
on officially assuming the position of Chairman of Zhizhen Group.

102
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,310
That concludes today's meeting.

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,630
Mr. Li,

104
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,680
didn't you give me your word?

105
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,950
Miss Su,

106
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,240
I didn't promise you anything.

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,830
Yu, I've done my best.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,190
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

109
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,430
You won.

110
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,000
Most people do care only about personal gain.

111
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,510
You won too.

112
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,870
Someone still chose to be loyal.

113
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,600
What exactly did Xiao Lang

114
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,430
offer Li Mingqi

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,120
to get him to switch sides so suddenly?

116
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,270
Hello, Ms. Gao.

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,190
Xiao Lang is negotiating a deal with Mr. Wang

118
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,120
from Dawang Construction.

119
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
The project is estimated to be worth 80 million.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,680
Should we intervene?

121
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,830
Of course.

122
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,800
Secure it at all costs.

123
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,720
Even if he becomes chairman,

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,040
it won't matter.

125
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,630
I'll turn him into a puppet

126
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,750
just like Su Qichao.

127
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,950
The company's money will still be ours.

128
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,510
Keep in close contact with Su Mingyu

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,040
and find out everything you can

130
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,750
about Xiao Lang's deal with Dawang Construction.

131
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,720
That deal is mine.
