[Episode 11]

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,610
The people closest to me

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,420
are all dead.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,390
Zixing,

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,110
you still have me.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
If Ms. Meizhen knew what you've become,

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,430
she would be heartbroken.

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,430
What does this have to do with me?

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,400
Su Mingyu,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,790
don't try to gain my sympathy

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,070
with your fabricated stories.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,630
Your father got what he deserved.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,480
This was his retribution.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
If you want to take back

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,760
your villa and company from me,

17
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,310
that makes us enemies.

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,840
Stop pestering me.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,630
Stay away from my life.

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,630
We are foes,

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,400
and we will only end up destroying each other.

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,560
How did you end up like this?

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,070
Do you not remember

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,710
anything from when we were kids?

25
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,760
What is there to remember?

26
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,780
I am not him!

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,150
Then why won't you let me go in there?

28
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,710
So you really want to know the secret inside, huh?

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,950
Let go of me!

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,310
I don't want to go in anymore.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,510
I once truly hoped

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,920
that you were Zixing,

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,400
because I had been longing for his return.

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,350
But now, I'd rather you weren't him.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,610
Someone as wonderful as him

36
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,230
could never turn into a monster like you.

37
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,350
I don't know what kind of person

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,430
this Li Zixing you speak of was,

39
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,120
but from today on,

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
you can consider him

41
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,430
dead.

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,630
He's gone.

43
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,710

the hatred between us

will never disappear.

and no matter what,

I cannot let you stay by my side.

63
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,320
Mom,

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,390
Yu is here.

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,950
Just stay with us and make yourself at home.

66
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,070
No need to feel uneasy.

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
My mom and I will take good care of you.

68
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,950
I told you long ago to come here,

69
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,390
but you insisted on staying in that old house.

70
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,390
Yu,

71
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,040
if you're not happy at work,

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,830
I can help you with it.

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,110
Ms. Gao.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,630
I'd like

75
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,350
to make a deal with you using my ten percent stake

76
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,000
in Zhizhen Group.

77
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,320
All I want in return is the position of Design Director

78
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,230
and some projects.

79
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll entrust

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,480
all my shares to you.

81
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,390
That way,

82
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,830
your stake in the company would surpass Xiao Lang's.

83
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,110
Does this deal work for you?

84
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,630
We're going to be family sooner or later,

85
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,110
so there's no need to talk about deals.

86
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,350
Come on. Let's talk inside.

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,950
Let's go.

88
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,350
I've been hoping you'd move in for a long time.

89
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,110
Rui.

90
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,070
Mr. Xiao.

91
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,200
Call Su Mingyu over.

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,280
How are these files organized?

93
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,320
There aren't even any category labels.

94
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,230
Sorry, Mr. Xiao.

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,920
These files were organized by me.

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,750
Miss Su submitted her resignation today

97
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,350
and is currently handling the paperwork in HR.

98
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,040
I saw the photo of your son last time.

99
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,840
He's really handsome.

100
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,520
Thanks for your kind words.

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,990
Let me introduce you to someone.

102
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,310
This is the Finance Director of Chengzhi Group.

103
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,280
Nice to see you.

104
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Mom,

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,310
Li Mingqi has already agreed.

106
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,750
The Garden Villa project

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,430
will definitely bring Xiao Lang down.

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,700
Good.

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,430
At least all that money didn't go to waste.

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,870
He reported several of my overseas companies,

111
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,190
and all their operations are suspended.

112
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,080
This time, I must destroy him.

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,190
Don't worry, Mom.

114
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Yu, you can really hold your liquor.

115
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,750
Mr. Li,

116
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,080
let me propose a toast to you alone.

117
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,600
Ziyang,

118
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,190
we can't help but envy you

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,110
with such a beauty by your side.

120
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,600
I truly appreciate

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,080
your support for my father in the past.

122
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,960
I'll down this first. You may drink at your own pace.

123
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,310
Impressive. I'll down mine too.

124
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,520
Yu,

125
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,990
a toast to you.

126
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
Thank you for your years

127
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,280
of dedication to Zhizhen Group.

128
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,840
It's an honor to have your support.

129
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,960
You've truly impressed me today.

130
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,840
I'll drink on behalf of my fiancee.

131
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,330
You...

132
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,600
What are you doing?

133
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,960
Let go of me!

134
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,080
Stop right there!

135
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,430
Xiao Lang,

136
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,520
taking someone away from my banquet like this

137
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,790
is far too disrespectful.

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,280
Besides, your engagement with Yu

139
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,750
was already called off.

140
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,550
I've never cared

141
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,230
about the rumors regarding Yu.

142
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,080
Our engagement was never called off.

143
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,520
She

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,520
is still my fiancee.

145
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,480
Let me go!

146
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,410
Let go!

147
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,430
Let go!

148
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,990
Why won't you leave me alone?

149
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,870
You want me to let you drink with those people?

150
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,870
To let Li Ziyang harass you?

151
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,670
I just want to tell you

152
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,790
that Li Mingqi, the man you had dinner with,

153
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,790
is purely profit-driven.

154
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,640
He only cares about benefits and never values old ties.

155
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,280
If Li Ziyang brought you to discuss business with him,

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,480
there's definitely an ulterior motive.

157
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,480
To Li Ziyang, it's nothing but business between you two.

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,480
I have no feelings left.

159
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
Business is all that matters to me now.

160
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,840
If you want to do business,

161
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,040
you'll get a better deal with me.

162
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,990
But if you choose to deal with Li Ziyang,

163
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,870
you're making an enemy of me.

164
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,230
We've always been enemies.

Su Mingyu,

179
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,550
is this truly the choice you've made?

180
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,470
You would rather do what you despise,

181
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,040
pretend to conform, and flatter those in power?

182
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,070
Well,

183
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,470
it's all because of me.

184
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,920
I was the one who pushed you away,

185
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,470
the one who forced you to give up

186
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,400
on Li Zixing, whom you waited eighteen years for.

187
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Yet why does my heart ache so much?

188
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,880
