00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,750
Mom, I'm back!

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,230
Su Qichao,

3
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,710
your reckoning has finally come.

4
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,790
Yu,

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,320
your dad and I have worked together for so many years.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,940
[Beloved Father Su Qichao]
Given the close bond

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,390
between our families,

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,560
I've always seen you as one of my own.

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,880
Now that your father is gone,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,960
Ziyang and I

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,000
will surely take good care of you.

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,520
Don't worry, Yu.

13
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,320
I'll take good care of you,

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,640
and my mom will look after your dad's company.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,070
Zhizhen needs no one to look after it.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Congratulations to Zhizhen Group on this momentous occasion.

17

[Beloved Father Su Qichao]

18
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,150
Who are you?

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Today is my father's funeral,

20
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,700
yet you show up

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,790
with a bouquet of red flowers

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,640
and say something like that?

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,870
That's completely inappropriate.

24
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,000
I am Xiao Lang.

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,070
He's the one who bought all the shares

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,280
from Su Qichao.

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
How dare you come here?

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,280
It was you who schemed against Mr. Su,

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,240
forcing him to hand over all his shares,

30
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,750
and the sheer anger took his life.

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,120
Ms. Gao, that's quite an accusation.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,400
Su Qichao was in debt to me.

33
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,190
He signed the transfer agreement himself.

34
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,090
Settling debts with shares

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,910
is perfectly reasonable.

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,870
With so many Zhizhen employees and board members here,

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,630
does anyone think this was a hostile takeover?

38
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,630
You caused my father's death.

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,150
Take these flowers away.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,870
Take them away!

41
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,800
You caused my father's death!

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,080
Take them away!

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,710
Let go of me!

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
Let go!

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Miss Su,

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
don't get so worked up.

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,750
Pull yourself together

48
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,590
and watch as I reclaim

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,400
everything from the Su family

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
that was never truly yours,

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,310

I am Zhizhen Group's newly appointed acting chairman.

53
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,910
I brought these flowers today

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,720
to make one thing clear.

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,200
From this moment on,

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,480
Zhizhen has entered a new era.

57
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,880
Anyone who still mourns Su Qichao

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,390
is my enemy.

Yes.

Yes.

67

I'm glad you like it, Zixing.

Mom, did Dad abandon us?

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,190
Why did he

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,400
leave with Ms. Gao Rui?

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,040
Why did that little boy

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,920
say that Dad was his father?

81
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,280

Xiao Lang,

101
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,600
how much more did my dad owe you

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
that you have to be so ruthless?

103
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,640
Ruthless?

104
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,960
Compared to what Su Qichao owed me,

105
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,080
this is nowhere near enough.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,870
This is just the beginning.

107
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,230
I can't leave.

108
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,600
This is the place my father worked so hard to protect.

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,480
I can't just walk away.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
I'm so useless.

111
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,080
I couldn't protect anyone.

112
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,190
My father is gone,

113
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,600
the company was taken,

114
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,670
and now even this place has been seized by Xiao Lang.

115
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
What am I supposed to do now?

116
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,840
It's pouring outside.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,640
Who are you

118
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,230
staging this sob story for?

119
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,350
I'll give you all my money.

120
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,110
Just let me stay.

121
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,720
I have to stay here.

122
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,550
Give me a reason.

123
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,400
This place holds my last memories

124
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,840
with the most important person to me.

125
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,920
I promised my father

126
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,720
I would protect it.

127
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,040
I'm waiting for someone to return.

128
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,040
Since it means so much to you,

129
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,550
what do you have to offer in exchange?

130
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,790
What do you want?

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
If I have it, it's yours.

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,870
I want you.

133
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,840
Sure.

134
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,110
So eager, huh?

135
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,160
I… That's not what I meant.

136
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,920
I do want to stay here,

137
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,790
but I have my boundaries.

138
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
What are you doing, Xiao Lang?

139
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,990
Put me down, Xiao Lang!

140
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,830
Why did you let Su Mingyu stay?

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,770
Are you hesitating?

142
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,830
Have you forgotten how Su Qichao and Gao Rui conspired

143
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,790
to kill your mother?

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,830
Have you forgotten how he took everything from you?

145
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,550
Think about all the suffering you've endured over the years.

146
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,370
Why did you come back in secrecy?

147
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
This is your home.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,470
Zhizhen was your mother's company.

149
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,460
Everything Su Mingyu had

150
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,260
growing up

151
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,910
should have been yours.

152
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,550
Look at your mother.

153
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,640
Remember how she died so tragically before your very eyes!

156
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm keeping her here

157
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,160
so she can experience what it is like

158
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,430
to have her life ruined just like mine.

159

They owe me,

160
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,160
and she will pay for her father's sins.
