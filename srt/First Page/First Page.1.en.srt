1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,330
Room 3320.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,710
3320.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,840
Yeah. I'm here.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm in front of the door.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,420
Open the door.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,760
You're only diligent at times like this, huh?

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,350
Stop talking nonsense and just open the door.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,640
No housewarming gift for you.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,520
I can't open the door right now. Just come in.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,600
What do you mean you can't open it?

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,890
Open it quickly.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,270
Toilet paper is surprisingly heavy.

13
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,150
Hey, the password is 0000. Hanging up.

14
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,190
Hey.

15
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:27,810
Hey.

16
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,860
Hey, Han Jisu!

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,200
What is he doing that he can't open the door?

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,240
And what kind of password is 0000?

19
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,750
Even a thief would say "Thank you" and walk right in.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,100
Did Han Jisu have sneakers like this?

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,000
You should have opened the door before showering.

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,790
Han Jisu.

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,380
Come out quickly.

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Hey, you were home but didn't even open the door...

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,140
Who are you?

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,350
Who are you?

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,480
A thief!?

28
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,070
Han Jisu.

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,610
I told you a thief would say "Thank you" and come in.

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,950
Now the thief is even taking a shower like it's his own house.

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,200
Look who's talking, entering someone else's house.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,740
I think you're the thief.

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,500
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,750
Room 3320.

35
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,210
It's Han Jisu's house.

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,170
Room 3320?

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,170
This is Room 3302.

38
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,880
The place you're looking for is Room 3320.

39
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,640
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,100
I got the numbers confused.

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
It's okay.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,720
The password just happened to be the same.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,930
Excuse me.

45
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,730
I'm really sorry.

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,360
I guess there's someone else besides me who uses 0000 as a password.

47
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,540
I'm so embarrassed, I could die.

48
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,540
Hey, so what did you say?

49
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,210
Did you go in and say "Hello"?

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,840
That's seriously too funny.

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,340
You need to study numbers again. You.

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,840
Confusing 3320 with 3302... haha.

53
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,350
Senior (Sunbaenim).

54
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,980
You moved recently, right?

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,070
No, but Kang Woojin mistook Room 3302 for Room 3320 and went in.

56
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,070
And he even confidently punched in the password and entered.

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,240
Huh?

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,070
The door opened?

59
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,780
Exactly.

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,160
There's another guy like Han Jisu out there.

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,490
Who sets their password to 0000 anyway?

62
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,580
Huh?

63
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,790
Well, I do have a friend who does that.

64
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,080
See? I told you it's common.

65
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,300
That was seriously the funniest story I've heard recently.

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,920
I told you to stop.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,170
Oh, shall we?

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,220
Let's study numbers now.

69
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,930
I'll teach you.

70
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,890
3302 and 3320 are different.

71
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,510
Got it?

72
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,810
Senior, do you need me to do anything?

73
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,690
Ah!

74
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,940
My friend said he'll help with the research for the group project.

75
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,190
Really?

76
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,530
That senior is majoring in this, right?

77
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,150
He is majoring in it,

78
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,820
but he took this professor's class twice before going to the army.

79
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,740
When I mentioned the assignment, he said he's done it before.

80
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,530
But how much did he skip class

81
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,700
to take it twice?

82
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,410
Well, he doesn't really listen diligently.

83
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,580
But is it okay to ask him?

84
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,630
Won't our group project be ruined?

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,130
It's just because he was lazy to go to school

86
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,550
and missed attendance checks.

87
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,010
He got an A+ the second time.

88
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,720
He's smart.

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,300
He's just a bit lazy.

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,550
Is there such thing as an A+ in this professor's class?

91
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,300
In this tough class?

92
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,930
That's why he's trustworthy.

93
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,140
He says he can help tomorrow,

94
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,100
but I have classes all day tomorrow so I don't think I can go.

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,020
Jisu, can you go instead?

96
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,320
Yes, I'll go.

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
Just tell me the meeting place.

98
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,530
Thanks.

99
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,700
But since I'm going to ask for a favor,

100
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,780
is it okay to go empty-handed?

101
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,990
Yeah.

102
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,490
Just go as you are.

103
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,580
Okay, I'll just go.

104
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm going first.

105
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,460
Please take care of it.

106
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,830
You're leaving already?

107
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,670
Goodbye.

108
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,760
So embarrassing.

109
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,380
Hey, aren't you going to class?

110
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,470
It's 50 minutes past.

111
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,350
Geez, thanks for telling me so soon.

112
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,270
I'm leaving first.

113
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,140
Go, Room 3302.

114
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,270
I'm Room 20.

115
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,350
I told you to stop.

116
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,060
Go quickly.

117
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,730
Run.

118
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,860
You'll be late.

119
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,320
Hey, Cha Jaehyun.

120
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,530
The person asking for a favor is late.

121
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,410
I have to go back.

122
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,040
Hey, you said you had no classes today, so I thought you weren't at school.

123
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
Why are you at school?

124
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,710
Hey, am I not a student?

125
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,960
That's true, but...

126
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,040
You don't usually come even when you have classes.

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,000
Whatever.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,170
So where are we doing it?

129
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,720
I told you I have to go.

130
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,430
Unlike someone, I'm not in my graduating semester yet.

131
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,180
Hey, then why did you call me?

132
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,890
Hey, please turn on your notifications.

133
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,560
I sent you a message.

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,810
I said a junior will be waiting by the bus stop.

135
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,900
Then what about unpacking for the move?

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,900
A very healthy and strong junior will be better.

137
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,940
Feel free to put him to work.

138
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,940
I'm going.

139
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,280
Hey!

140
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,120
I haven't liked it since yesterday.

141
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,580
Friend.

142
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,750
My one and only friend, Woojin.

143
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
I'm really sorry.

144
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,800
A club dinner was suddenly scheduled.

145
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,420
I'm the club president, so I can't miss it.

146
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,550
Ah, change it?

147
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,800
Of course I asked.

148
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,760
But everyone said only today works.

149
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,100
So please go instead of me.

150
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,260
I'm really sorry.

151
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,240
Han Jisu, you bad guy.

152
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,280
You owe me two meals.

153
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,540
Huh?

154
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,080
Room 3320 from yesterday?

155
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,500
Hello.

156
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,710
You're senior Cha Jaehyun, right?

157
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,880
I'm Kim Sihyeong senior's junior, Kang Woojin.

158
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
Senior?

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760
Ah!

160
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,100
Yes, hello.

161
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,390
Thank you for helping with the assignment.

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,860
Kim Sihyeong.

163
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,360
He said you looked healthy and strong?

164
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,690
I don't think so?

165
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,450
More importantly, does he not remember me?

166
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,030
Do you not know who I am?

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
What?

168
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
What is it?

169
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,950
I've never seen him before?

170
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,450
I don't know who he is?

171
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,450
Have we met before?

172
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,670
Ay, how could I not remember that face?

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,420
Or maybe...

174
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,170
Flirting?
