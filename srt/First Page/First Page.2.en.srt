1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
Han Jisu, you bad guy.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,340
You owe me two meals.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,050
Huh?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,590
Room 3320 from yesterday?

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,020
Hello.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,230
You're senior Cha Jaehyun, right?

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,400
I'm Kim Sihyeong senior's junior, Kang Woojin.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,150
Senior?

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,280
Ah!

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,610
Yes, hello.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,910
Thank you for helping with the assignment.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,370
Kim Sihyeong.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,870
He said you looked healthy and strong?

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,200
I don't think so?

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,960
More importantly, does he not remember me?

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,540
Do you not know who I am?

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,830
What?

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,790
What is it?

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,460
I've never seen him before?

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,960
I don't know who he is?

21
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,970
Have we met before?

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,180
Ay, how could I not remember that face?

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,930
Or maybe...

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,390
Flirting?

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,640
Why are you laughing?

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,190
It's nothing.

27
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,310
You said we need to research for the assignment.

28
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,900
Let's go.

29
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,690
Okay, then let's go to a cafe...

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,940
Let's go to my house.

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,240
What?

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,780
My place is close, and the materials are at home.

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,910
Okay.

34
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,450
I guess I'll have to unpack alone.

35
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:24,950
Let's go.

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,350
Don't tell me when you asked if I didn't know...

37
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,560
I haven't changed the password yet.

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,100
0000.

39
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,690
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,400
I was really sorry about yesterday.

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,530
I was just so flustered yesterday.

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,160
Did you not like my apple (apology)?

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,870
I gave it with all my sincerity.

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,990
Yesterday's apology was enough.

45
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,460
It's fascinating that we ran into each other twice by coincidence,

46
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,670
and it's the first time I've seen someone as interesting as you, Junior.

47
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,290
I also wanted to see you one more time.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,920
What?

49
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,010
Shall we go in?

50
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,640
Yes.

51
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,240
Please wait a moment.

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,990
I'll go get the materials.

53
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,910
Okay.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,330
This house doesn't suit Han Jisu at all.

55
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,000
Why did I get confused?

56
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,210
Even the sneakers weren't Han Jisu's style.

57
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,430
Why did you do that?

58
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,970
You idiot.

59
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,470
Idiot.

60
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,180
Idiot.

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,100
Idiot.

62
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,310
Ugh, idiot.

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,270
Hitting yourself like that won't make you smarter.

64
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,110
Laptop.

65
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,910
Ah, yes.

66
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,870
But if you just give me the data, I can organize it myself.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,130
I can't just give you the cheat sheet.

68
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,460
Besides, it's data from 3 years ago, so a lot of it might be useless.

69
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,340
Okay.

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,770
I don't set my password to 0000.

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,990
I wondered if there was anyone else like me.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,820
But the kid living in 3320 is just like you, Senior.

73
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,260
Make yourself comfortable.

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,970
You can speak casually.

75
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,800
Um... I heard you're close with Senior Sihyeong.

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Shall I?

77
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
That was fast.

78
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,980
Yeah. It's because I can't refuse people.

79
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,360
Ah... what should I do?

80
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Why?

81
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
Is there a problem?

82
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,900
I think the file is somewhere else.

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,860
I'll wait.

84
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,360
Take your time looking for it.

85
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,490
As you can see, I haven't unpacked yet,

86
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,040
so I think it will take a while to find it.

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,330
Then...

88
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,710
Do you have class tomorrow?

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,250
Yes, I do.

90
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,380
When does it end?

91
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,960
Uh...

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,630
It ends at 6.

93
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,350
Do you want to come tomorrow?

94
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,010
Tomorrow?

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm going to unpack today,

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,020
so I'll find the USB.

97
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,400
Don't we need to do the assignment?

98
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,360
Yes, that's right.

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,530
I'll come tomorrow.

100
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,080
Then come by 7.

101
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,580
Okay.

102
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,980
Cha Jaehyun, what are you doing right now?

103
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,530
Senior, I'm sorry I'm late.

104
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,070
The professor kept talking.

105
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,740
Senior?

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,580
Yes?

107
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,250
You call Kim Sihyeong "Senior".

108
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,050
Call me "Senior" too.

109
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,050
Or call me "Hyung".

110
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,430
I'll call you Senior.

111
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,640
Suit yourself.

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,320
Thank you.

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,160
Did you finish unpacking?

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,790
I heard from Senior Sihyeong.

115
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,290
You could have asked me to help.

116
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,800
I said a strong and healthy junior,

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,340
but that wouldn't be you.

118
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,340
That is true, but...

119
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,600
Are you close with Kim Sihyeong?

120
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,470
Yes.

121
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,190
He's taken good care of me since freshman year.

122
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,900
And he has a great personality.

123
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,110
He's always smiling, so I never know what he's thinking.

124
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,530
His personality is good.

125
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,160
I think I know why Senior Sihyeong said you were a close friend.

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,910
We're not close.

127
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,750
Senior Sihyeong praised you a lot to me at first.

128
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,180
He said you're really smart.

129
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,510
That's a fact.

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,100
Senior.

131
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,810
Do you know you're surprisingly funny?

132
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,950
I think there's not enough space.

133
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,320
Is the file bigger than I thought?

134
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,330
Really?

135
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,700
Then this...

136
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,580
Can I delete this?

137
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,630
I think it's safer to delete this one.

138
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,010
Leaving the data from 1 year ago as is...

139
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Are you hot?

140
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,230
No.

141
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,810
I'm not hot.

142
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,500
Senior?

143
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,050
Senior?

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:17,840
Uh.

145
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,010
Uh.

146
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,100
You have a bit of a fever?

147
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,230
Ah, it must be because I'm wearing thick clothes.

148
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,490
I'm going to use the restroom.

149
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,580
Restroom?

150
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,540
Oh. It's over there.

151
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,380
What the...

152
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,220
What's wrong with me?
