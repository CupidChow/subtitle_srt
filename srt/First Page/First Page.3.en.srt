1
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,560
Senior?

2
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,110
Senior?

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,900
Uh.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,070
Uh.

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,150
You have a bit of a fever?

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,290
Ah, it must be because I'm wearing thick clothes.

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,550
I'm going to use the restroom.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,630
Restroom?

9
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,590
Oh. It's over there.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,440
What the...

11
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,270
What's wrong with me?

12
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,620
What?

13
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,630
Why are you setting the mood? It doesn't suit you.

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,790
I don't know.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,210
Is there something Cha Jaehyun doesn't know?

16
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,800
That's a first.

17
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,430
Hey.

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,140
You know...

19
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,390
About Kang Woojin.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,890
Woojin?

21
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,560
What about Woojin?

22
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,980
I heard he broke into your house a while ago?

23
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,030
I laugh about that several times before going to sleep.

24
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,900
That was a mistake.

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,200
What?

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,110
Isn't this it?

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,370
No, it's not that.

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,620
What is it then?

29
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,830
Does he have a girlfriend?

30
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,000
Huh?

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,460
Does Kang Woojin have someone he's seeing?

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Is this relationship advice?

33
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,220
You asking me?

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,170
Just answer me.

35
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,680
No.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
But he won't in the future either.

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,720
What does that mean?

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,770
Woojin...

39
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,270
Says he won't date anymore.

40
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,730
Why?

41
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,530
How did you fall for Woojin at first sight?

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
It's refreshing and fun to see Cha Jaehyun having a crush,

43
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,070
but it's kind of pitiful.

44
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,820
Who has a crush...

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,910
Hey, you'd know if you tried it.

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,870
That's exactly what a crush is.

47
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,290
Wanting to know about that person,

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,330
lying about not finding materials just to see them,

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,590
wanting to see them again even after seeing them,

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,380
going to school to run into them by chance.

51
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,510
Did you think I wouldn't know?

52
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,300
Hey, how did you know that?

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,930
Does someone who's had a crush just know by looking at the face?

54
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,890
Hey!

55
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,600
Why bring up someone else's love life?

56
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,770
I heard it from Woojin.

57
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,810
You told him to come back because you couldn't find the materials?

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,690
Cha Jaehyun did?

59
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,690
You left the materials in the moving boxes?

60
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,860
But...

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,070
Why won't he date?

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,660
Woojin got hurt badly by his ex.

63
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,750
I don't know the details either.

64
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,170
But he must have met some crazy guy.

65
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Crazy guy?

66
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,920
I told you I don't know the details.

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,880
If it's a guy, then a man?

68
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,010
Hey, that's actually better.

69
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,470
I was really worried

70
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,390
he'd say no because I'm a man.

71
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,470
Hey, that...

72
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,770
Why?

73
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,940
The person you have a crush on is a man too.

74
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,940
Hey, how do you know that?

75
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,070
Did I say he was a man?

76
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,150
No, I didn't say that.

77
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,820
Didn't you recommend that house on purpose?

78
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,080
To see that Jisu or Suji person

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,910
who lives in Room 3320

80
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,120
more often?

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,870
Using me as an excuse.

82
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not like that.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,670
Hey, and you haven't invited me over once.

84
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,840
Well, if it's not like that, you don't have to invite me ever.

85
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,460
Hey, Cha Jaehyun.

86
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,520
Is something wrong?

87
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,440
No, nothing.

88
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,780
What is it?

89
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,080
Did that bastard contact you again?

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,200
Is he still stalking you?

91
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,460
No. He doesn't contact me anymore.

92
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,750
Hey, if he contacts you again, tell me no matter what.

93
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,540
Okay?

94
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,880
Even if I get dragged to the police station this time, I won't stay still.

95
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,260
I almost got arrested back then too.

96
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,180
Why use your good strength on a guy like that?

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,140
No, that's...

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,850
Because you were having a hard time.

99
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,980
But you said he doesn't show up, so what's wrong?

100
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,350
I thought I couldn't date anymore.

101
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,820
But you think you can now?

102
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,400
No. I'm still scared.

103
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,240
Even he (Hyung) was a good person at first.

104
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,410
I don't know how he'll change in the future.

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm scared.

106
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,580
Because nothing lasts forever.

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,210
Don't tell me...

108
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,710
Are you interested in that senior Jaehyun?

109
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,850
I don't know what kind of person Senior Jaehyun is,

110
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,720
but seeing that he's close with Senior Sihyeong,

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,100
he probably isn't trash.

112
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,980
Hey, trash?

113
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,140
He's not that kind of person.

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,850
Oh?

115
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,480
Look at you taking his side. Since when?

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,070
No, because he's Senior Sihyeong's friend.

117
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,450
But how did you know?

118
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,580
You meet that senior often these days.

119
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,990
You even broke plans with me yesterday.

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,000
No, that's...

121
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,040
You went to meet Senior Sihyeong first.

122
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,510
In that sense, I have plans with Senior.

123
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,880
Okay.

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,760
Hey, Woojin.

125
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,810
Just follow your heart.

126
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,480
If you like him, isn't that enough?

127
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,770
Just because you met one jerk like that,

128
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,940
you can't not have anyone by your side for the rest of your life.

129
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,740
More than anything, you have feelings for him, so there's no need to deny it.

130
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,110
And if by chance he's a weird guy,

131
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,200
I won't let him get away with it.

132
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,910
I'm going first.

133
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,080
Call me.

134
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,720
Woojin, over here.

135
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,190
I know he's a good person.

136
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,150
My heart reacts strangely to even his small actions,

137
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,070
to the point where I can't calm down.

138
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,780
But I'm scared.

139
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,200
That all the happy memories

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
will tie me down and turn into a nightmare.

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,330
I'm afraid.

142
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,960
(Do you want to come over after the assignment?)

143
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,510
(Let's have dinner.)

144
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,760
(Yes.)

145
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,470
Really, what should I do about Woojin?

146
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,430
Because of that bastard.

147
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,110
Senior, aren't you being too harsh?

148
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,860
What?

149
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,030
How can you be like that to someone you liked?

150
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,910
Obsession should have a limit.

151
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Woojin wasted a whole semester because he couldn't come to school back then.

152
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,660
Jisu.

153
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,540
Yes?

154
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,470
Senior, you know how to make expressions too?

155
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,930
I thought you only knew how to smile.

156
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,730
Since you met me,

157
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,110
do you know you've only talked about Woojin?

158
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,730
Did I?

159
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,610
I care about Woojin a lot.

160
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,160
What about me?

161
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,080
What?

162
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,710
How close are you with me?

163
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,000
With you, Senior...

164
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,670
I'm close with you too.

165
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,470
You're my favorite senior,

166
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,260
and Hyung (older brother).

167
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,350
But with Woojin, since we were young...

168
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,770
I want to be...

169
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,690
More than Woojin to you.

170
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,440
Senior.

171
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,950
I want to meet you and talk about us,

172
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,370
and I want all the attention you give Woojin to come to me.

173
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,000
Today too,

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,420
we met because you said you had something to tell me.

175
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,840
Not about Woojin,

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,680
but about us,

177
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,640
you said you wanted to talk about yourself.

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,850
I like you.

179
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,310
I've liked you for a long time.

180
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,150
Hey.

181
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,450
It's so obvious that even people who don't know you know.

182
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,200
Why don't you know?

183
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,700
Senior, that's...

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,410
I wanted to say it at least once before graduating.

185
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,040
I don't have many classes left,

186
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,630
and I won't have many chances to see you.

187
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,880
I feel the same.

188
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,260
I have the same feelings as you, Senior.

189
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,520
Not confessing while drinking like this,

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,900
but I wanted to do it properly.

191
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,530
After the assignment, eating something nice, I wanted to do it coolly.

192
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,440
Jisu.

193
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,570
Senior.

194
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,490
No.

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,030
I can call you Hyung now, right?

196
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,240
I...

197
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,170
I like you, Hyung.

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,110
Jisu.

199
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,160
If we do more here, we'll be in trouble, right?
