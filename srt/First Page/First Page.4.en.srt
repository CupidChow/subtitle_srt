1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,250
I wanted to say it at least once before graduating.

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,880
I don't have many classes left,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,470
and I won't have many chances to see you.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,720
I feel the same.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,100
I have the same feelings as you, Senior.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,350
Not confessing while drinking like this,

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,730
but I wanted to do it properly.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,360
After the assignment, eating something nice, I wanted to do it coolly.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,280
Jisu.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,410
Senior.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,320
No.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,870
I can call you Hyung now, right?

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,080
I...

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,000
I like you, Hyung.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,950
Jisu.

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,000
If we do more here, we'll be in trouble, right?

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,090
How long are you going to keep it a secret?

18
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,470
Let's date publicly.

19
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,680
Move over.

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,180
Why?

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,930
Hey, wait...

22
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,140
Senior.

23
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,390
Your crush is over.

24
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,980
What?

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Did you know?

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,320
Only you didn't know.

27
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,150
Why did you chase after someone like him, Senior?

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,110
Because I was completely blinded by love.

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,160
What's wrong with me?

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,580
Right.

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Where can I find someone like you?

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,660
Hey, but aren't you going to the after-party?

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,370
I was going to tell you and leave.

34
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,420
I'll skip it.

35
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,340
Ah, why?

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,130
We all worked hard, so we should have an after-party.

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,130
Hey, Jisu.

38
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,550
Take a hint.

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,170
Hyung will be sad.

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,340
Just one drink to finish...

41
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,970
Go quickly.

42
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,140
He'll be waiting.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,100
Waiting?

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,550
Who?

45
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,390
Hey, let's go.

46
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,510
Hyung, is there something without me?

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,010
Hey, let's eat.

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,680
Hey, contact...

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,600
Be quiet.

50
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,160
(Can I come over now?)

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,330
(Come right away.)

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,620
Were you waiting?

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,350
I can't cook, so I ordered.

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,260
It'll be here soon.

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,770
There's something you can't do, Senior?

56
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,770
There are more things I can't do than you think.

57
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,480
I can't date either...

58
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,400
What?

59
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,370
What about you?

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you good at dating?

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,920
No...

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,920
That's good.

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,890
What do you mean good?

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,720
It's good to learn one by one together since we're both bad at it.

65
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,480
Woojin.

66
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,070
Senior.

67
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,660
Let go.

68
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,040
Don't avoid me, just look at me once.

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,000
I guess this is what liking is.

70
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,090
When you avoid me,

71
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,890
my heart aches to the point of numbness.

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,100
When you are wary,

73
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,680
it's harder for me.

74
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,650
Even knowing you won't accept me,

75
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,940
I have no choice but to confess.

76
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,990
Even if I try to hide it,

77
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,120
it can't be hidden anyway.

78
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,790
Even if I don't show it,

79
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,000
instead of disappearing,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,170
it only gets bigger and overwhelming.

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,130
I'm sorry, Senior.

82
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm scared.

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,890
Not because it's you, Senior,

84
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,850
but actually I...

85
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,270
I understand.

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,520
No...

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,730
I don't understand.

88
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,440
But just...

89
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,230
I'll try to understand.

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,490
Senior.

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,280
I won't ask you to do anything right now.

92
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,740
Just...

93
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,790
I'll try to become someone necessary to you.

94
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,750
So,

95
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,760
will you just give me a chance?

96
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:58,060
This is my first time too, so I worried a lot.

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,570
So this is what love at first sight feels like.

98
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,330
So liking someone is this happy.

99
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,830
I learned it for the first time.

100
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,790
Why is it me?

101
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,710
It would have been better if it wasn't me.

102
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,250
Because it's possible because it's you.

103
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,460
Because it's you,

104
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,510
everything I experienced for the first time was only good.

105
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,140
Senior.

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,970
Just a little bit.

107
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll stay just a little bit closer.

108
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,490
I'll stay just a little bit closer than friendship.

109
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,560
I think the delivery is here?

110
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,100
No.

111
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,310
I don't think I'm hungry anymore?

112
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,870
Are Senior and I dating?

113
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm only waiting for Kang Woojin's answer.

114
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,970
Just thinking about it...

115
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:12,780
A relationship where we kiss deeper than friends?

116
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,910
Someone waiting for the confession to be accepted,

117
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,580
and someone contemplating?

118
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,290
Senior.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,170
What are you worrying about so much?

120
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,630
I'm not begging you to date me, right?

121
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:40,640
I just like being with you, Senior,

122
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,230
but I was worried because I didn't know how to define our relationship.

123
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,190
Do you like being with me?

124
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
What about this?

125
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,000
I like it.
