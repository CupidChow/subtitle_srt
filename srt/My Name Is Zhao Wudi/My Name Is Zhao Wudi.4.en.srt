1
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
Hello.

2
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,160
Where are you?

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,880
I was sleeping.

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
Keep sleeping, then.

5
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,770
Where are the guys
who went to catch Shen Xingyu?

6
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,840
All lost.

7
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,000
According to the clues we've gathered,

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,370
there are a total of three
mysterious shareholders behind Shen Xingyu.

9
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,080
This key must have been
split into three parts

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,120
and kept separately.

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,280
Find out who are the other two.

12
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,740
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 4=

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,640
You got hurt?

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,680
Is Miss Shen worried about you?

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,320
How could Miss Shen like that face?
You're gonna fall outta favor.

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,960
I got injured because of her.

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,680
Miss Shen is into that?

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,640
- So, it's hard living off a wife.
- Go away.

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,000
Freeze, Wudi. This is so cool.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,440
Let go.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,080
How did you get that?

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,640
- I got hit by a car as a kid.
- Did a forklift poke you?

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not dumb.
Those are burns and gunshot wounds.

24
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
How painful was that?

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,440
How did you get those? Tell me.

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
You're boring.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
Wudi, look at this.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,760
Wudi, look at this. Here.

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
Do you know what this is?

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,960
It's the Gray Zone.

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
It's the most famous bounty list
in the underworld.

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,320
Only 30 people in the world
can be on this list.

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,760
They're all troublemakers.

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,280
On the top of the list is Cang Ming.

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,120
This is fake.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
It's used to fool dummies like you.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
The bounty is ten million dollars.

38
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Dead or alive.
Whoever catches him is gonna be rich.

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,480
The chances are slimmer
than winning the lottery.

40
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,840
Ma Liu, just be content
as a security guard.

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Security department.
Tell Zhao Wudi to go to the CEO's office.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,840
You asked me to come, but you're silent.

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,760
Then, I'm gonna sleep.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
Why did you follow me?

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Who followed you?

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,680
What can this prove?

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
This ringtone

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,960
is quite commonly used.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
Did I say anything?

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,840
Aren't you invincible?

51
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
Why are you injured?

52
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,560
Xingchen.

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,640
I understand the rules of your profession.

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,960
This coin

55
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
is payment for your life.

56
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
You must come back safely.

57
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,440
I gave this to my brother.

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,800
Why is it with you?

59
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,320
I got paid to do this.

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,320
What do you think?

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,200
Come in.

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,760
Miss Shen, there is an urgent matter
in the research department that needs you.

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,080
Okay, I got it.

64
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
Did he really come for this?

65
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,760
All it took was one fake document
to test him. How useless.

66
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
Maybe we guessed wrongly?

67
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,600
Hello?

68
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,240
Xingyu,

69
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,200
bring the person you decided on
home tomorrow.

70
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,840
Okay.

71
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,640
This formal suit is no good.
I can't move in this.

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
A formal suit is for formal occasions.

73
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,550
The restriction you feel
reminds you to exercise restraint.

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,240
This kinda counts as going home.

75
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,280
Is this necessary?

76
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,400
The larger the family, the more rules.
Just think of this as a game.

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,920
Act like a loving couple

78
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
with mutual respect, right?

79
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
Not just that.

80
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,400
They will make a fuss out of you.

81
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,520
But the family rules work both ways.

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,160
The head of the family
must also obey the rules.

83
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,390
Otherwise, he can't convince everyone.

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,320
As long as they acknowledge you
as the son-in-law,

85
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,560
they will never use this matter
to take back Xingyu Optoelectronics.

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,840
No need to be nervous.

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm not.

88
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,520
No?
You are speaking 10% faster than usual.

89
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,400
The velocity of your blood flow
increased by 20%.

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,120
Your pulse has gone up.
And your body temperature too.

91
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Most importantly,
everything I just said was nonsense.

92
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
I was just taking advantage of you.

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
And you say you aren't nervous.

94
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
I wasn't joking.

95
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,080
Okay. Plans are no match for changes.

96
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,780
When the soldiers come,
the general meets them.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
We do feel like a couple.

98
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,000
We're a loving couple.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,760
Xingyu and Wudi are here.

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,520
These two youngsters look quite in love.

101
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,800
It doesn't look fake.

102
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
A pheasant is an ill match for a phoenix.

103
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,200
I'll go welcome them.

104
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,880
Relax.

105
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
You should take this more seriously.

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
- Uncle Zhongtian.
- You're here.

107
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,520
The garden of the Shen family manor

108
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,880
isn't small.

109
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,910
Doesn't it attract thieves?

110
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,240
No one dares steal from the Shen family.

111
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Come, your Uncle Shen
is waiting at his study.

112
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,240
Your Uncle Zhongtian was bragging.

113
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,560
He said no one stole from your family.

114
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,760
Didn't I steal your heart?

115
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,880
Uncle Shen, we're here.

116
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,720
You're here.

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,040
When I was young,

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,440
I thought that Heaven is the most powerful,
the Earth comes second,

119
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,640
and I come in third.

120
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,200
It's at this old age

121
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,040
that I learned respect.

122
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,720
One should be fearless when young.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,080
Does living in fear

124
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,680
mean you won't grow old?

125
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,760
You think I'm old, too?

126
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,480
That wasn't what I meant.

127
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,560
Let's see if you are really capable.

128
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,760
You're a security guard, right?

129
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Look around.

130
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,440
What do you think of my house's security?

131
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,720
The overall size of the house
is approximately 500 square meters.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
24-hours surveillance cameras are outside

133
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
with no blind spots.

134
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,280
Your surveillance system
is considered okay.

135
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,400
You have two groups of security guards,

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
one is visible and the other hidden.

137
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,280
Their response time to warning signs

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,040
is within 10 seconds.

139
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,040
This kind of set up

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,680
is quite sufficient.

141
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,400
How many do I need against someone

142
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
like you?

143
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,040
For me, it isn't about
the number of people.

144
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,320
It depends on luck
and if there is a warning time.

145
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
That's quite a statement.

146
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,920
My security consultant

147
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,640
installed six listening devices
in this room.

148
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,600
Since you are that confidence,

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,720
find them all.

150
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,960
I'll give you half an hour.

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,480
- Uncle Shen, he...
- It's good to have confidence.

152
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
But don't let it blind you.

153
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,400
The business world is a battlefield
where you kill without a sword.

154
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,170
- He's really...
- It's fine, Xingyu.

155
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,320
Trust me.

156
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,560
Uncle Shen,

157
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll use this

158
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,720
to keep the time.

159
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Let's begin.

160
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,000
The hiding spots are too stereotypical

161
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,680
and affect the listening quality.

162
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,800
If these six are to mislead me,

163
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,840
I believe I've passed the test.

164
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,400
If it isn't,

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,400
you should change
your security consultant.

166
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Excuse me.

167
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,800
Zhao Wudi, what are you doing?

168
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,920
Your dragon walking stick is beautiful,

169
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,280
especially the eyes.

170
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,920
It's quite big.

171
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,520
Good.

172
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,520
The young surpasses the old.

173
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,640
Come, let's have lunch.

174
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
