1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,920
You're so rough.

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,080
- Liu.
- Miss Shen.

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,760
There's an intrusion.

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,680
Come with me, now.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,800
Run, run.

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,080
Oh, no.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,440
This way, this way.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,520
Get back in, get back in.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,720
Miss Shen,
there might not be a way out later.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,320
I'll stop them outside.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,600
Ling, protect Miss Shen.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
- Don't come out.
- Okay.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,440
Don't open the door.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,780
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 17=

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,960
It's me.

16
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
- Wudi.
- Turn on the lights.

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,920
Are you okay?

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,040
I'm really confused.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
I finally got away.

20
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,240
I didn't get hit by the bad guys
but I got hit by my own wife.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
I thought it was that bunch of people.

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,520
Sit over there.

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Here, sit.

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Wudi, where is my brother?

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,760
He is outside.

26
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,840
Let me see.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,360
Does it hurt?

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Honey, you hit me too hard.

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,520
You have to take good care of me tonight.

30
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,200
You're covering the wrong eye.

31
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,600
It's this side.

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,920
I can't believe the pain transfers.

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,560
Do you know how worried I was
when you didn't come back?

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,360
Are you worried about me or the company?

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,240
You, of course.

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm sorry, Xingyu.

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
This is the first night
I wasn't by your side.

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,800
I made you worry.

39
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,200
Through this incident, I am certain

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,640
that Uncle Zhongtian
and those who captured me

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
are accomplices.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,080
They lured me away

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,120
to deal with the Shen Group

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
and you.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,720
I guessed it.

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,240
There must be a reason
for Uncle Shen's death.

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,360
Although Uncle Shen kept targeting you,

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,440
he never wanted to listen to them.

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,600
That's why they removed him
and put Uncle Zhongtian there.

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
You need to be careful from now on.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
With you by my side,

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,560
I'm not worried at all.

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Wudi,

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,920
I managed to hold on until you came back.

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
I thought I was a goner.

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,480
Did you know

57
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,830
that I just fought off

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,680
eight of them alone?

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Miss Shen, I...

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I didn't interrupt you two, did I?

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Ma Liu, you did very well tonight.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,240
I'll reward you
with a six-month salary bonus.

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,400
That's too kind.

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,240
Hurry up and thank Miss Shen.

65
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Thank you, Miss Shen.

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
How many times have I mentioned

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,640
that my goal is Wushuang?

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
It's Wushuang.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,320
But why did you attack Zhao Wudi?

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
It's troublesome with Zhao Wudi around.

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
Then, you have to find a way
to get around it.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,240
Who do you take me for?

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,560
Another fool

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,200
like Mr. Han and Mr. Hu?

75
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,760
You will outsmart him.

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay, I understand.

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,880
Any progress on that matter
I asked you to investigate?

78
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,600
This is the person in charge
of the R&D team.

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
The chief scientist, Dr. Zhou.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,960
Let's invite Dr. Zhou

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
for a cup of coffee.

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Okay.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,080
Dr. Zhou, please calm down.

84
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,160
Subordinates don't know any better.

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,880
Mr. Shen, this is kidnapping.

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,040
You are the chief scientist
of Xingyu Optoelectronics.

87
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,080
You must know

88
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
that I value talented researchers
like you.

89
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,600
I invited you here today

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,000
to give you a chance
to realize a grand ambition.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,320
Thank you for the offer, Mr. Shen.

92
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,480
I don't have such a big ambition.

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Don't refuse me so quickly.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
As long as you agree to my conditions,

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,200
you will become the chief scientist
of the Shen Group.

96
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,600
You have the company's word

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
that all decisions are yours to make.

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,960
No one can interfere with what you do.

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,200
Most importantly,

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
I can offer you

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,440
an annual research grant of 500 million.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
500 million?

103
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,480
It's really simple.

104
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
Shen Xingyu

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,480
has a very important
new energy research project in her hands.

106
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
Codename Wushuang.

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Wushuang?

108
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
I shall be honest.

109
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,960
Wushuang is very advanced

110
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
and its theory is well-developed.

111
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,320
However, its safety and stability
cannot be guaranteed.

112
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,240
Further research is needed
before it can proceed

113
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,410
to large-scale mass production
and practical application.

114
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,640
I love challenges.

115
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,880
Dr. Zhou, I believe

116
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
you and I are the same.

117
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,560
We have a great ambition

118
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,320
to change the world.

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
Knowledge changes fate.

120
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,400
I know you love coffee.

121
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,240
I brewed this cup of coffee myself.

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,280
Try it.

123
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,320
Please have a seat.

124
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,080
Didn't you always wanna know
what Wushuang is?

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Wushuang is a new energy technology
10 years ahead of its time

126
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,320
that my parents developed.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,720
Once introduced,

128
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
it will transform the existing
new energy landscape.

129
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,440
It can even change the fate of mankind.

130
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,200
That Hu guy mentioned

131
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,320
that one unit of Wushuang

132
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,600
can support a mobile phone for half a year

133
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,840
and keep a car running for 3,000 miles.

134
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,440
More than that.

135
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,000
One unit of Wushuang

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
has that much of energy.

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
Just imagine it.

138
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,320
This invention is comparable
to a controlled nuclear fusion.

139
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,910
The four keys that Han Renxin found

140
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,520
are the keys to where Wushuang is stored.

141
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,480
But I've transferred them back now.

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
The rest are destroyed.

143
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,400
My brother is very cautious
about this technology.

144
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,880
It will be a disaster

145
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,960
if the bad guys get it.

146
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
Since my brother asked you to protect me,

147
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,840
I believe he meant for you
to protect Wushuang.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,920
What kind of people

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,280
wants to steal this technology?

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
I don't know.

151
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,520
Once they understand
the power of Wushuang,

152
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,920
I think everyone will want to steal it.

153
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Xingyu,

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
what is your plan?

155
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
It's better to take action

156
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,760
than to defend blindly.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
The company has sufficient funds now.

158
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,480
I've decided to manufacture

159
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,040
and mass-produce Wushuang.

160
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,560
As long as we can ensure
its safety and stability,

161
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,360
they will give up on it.

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,120
What's wrong?

163
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,840
Uncle Zhongtian wants me to attend
a meeting at Shen Group at 2:00 PM.

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,920
He's settling into his position
as the chairman.

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,040
