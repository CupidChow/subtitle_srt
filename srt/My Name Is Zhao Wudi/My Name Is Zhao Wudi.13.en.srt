1
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,120
What's going on?

2
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,040
We're betrayed.

3
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,960
Go!

4
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,680
Grenade.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,680
Xingchen.

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,040
Are you alright?

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm fine.

8
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,040
Xingchen.

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Go!

10
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,680
Just leave.

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,920
I can't make it.

12
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,640
No way.

13
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Let's go together.

14
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,760
You Ming.

15
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
Take this

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,680
to my sister.

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,720
Take good care of her.

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
Guard Wushuang for her.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,480
Run!

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Leaving or not?

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,240
Go!

22
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Xingchen!

23
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,180
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 13=

24
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,740
(Xingyu Optoelectronics Corporation)

25
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Mate,

26
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
rest in peace.

27
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,280
Why did you die so rashly?

28
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,720
You must haven't eaten anything.

29
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Here. Eat something.

30
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,900
It's hot.

31
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
500,000 dollars.

32
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
You should have let me have it.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,600
This way,
I could burn some paper money for you.

34
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,880
But now,

35
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,280
someone else got it.

36
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,640
Just make do with this.

37
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
You must keep your word.

38
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh gosh!

39
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,320
Stay away!

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,120
Don't come near me!

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,560
Are you insane?

42
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,880
W-Why is your name removed
from the Gray Zone?

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,320
Man, you're still alive!

44
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
I thought you were dead. Look!

45
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,440
Look! The reward for the No. 1 on the list,
Cang Ming has risen to 15 million.

46
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,680
This dude's reward is higher
than all the others added up.

47
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
What a poor guy!

48
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,600
As a saying goes,

49
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,920
the outstanding bear the attack.

50
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,320
Liu.

51
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm Cang Ming.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
You're Cang Ming?

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,760
Then I'll be Aoi Sola.

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,480
Stop bragging.

55
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,440
If you were Cang Ming,
I'd kill you right now.

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,240
That's because no one knows my identity.

57
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,360
Now I know it.

58
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,560
I've poisoned these.

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,880
Hurry. Eat the noodles. Come on.

60
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,360
Can you calm down?

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
Me? You should calm down, security guard.

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,480
You're Cang Ming?

63
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,160
Cang Ming is always secretive.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,320
There's not even a known photo of him.

65
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,480
Just say whatever you wanna say.

66
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,880
That's because
I've smashed the headquarters.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,840
Then they dare not expose my photo anymore.

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,400
You've got to top the Bragger List.

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,440
Gray Zone, huh.

70
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,640
It must be a bug of the system if you
make it to the Gray Zone.

71
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,720
You think you can pay for a ranking?

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,440
Oh right,

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,560
you're broke.

74
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Your money was spent in hiring
the three kidnappers.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,400
I was beaten up by them.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
What kind of buddy are you?

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,840
You'd only stab me in the back.

78
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,240
I'm so pissed off.

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,600
Security department, attention, please.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,760
Over.

81
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,880
Copy that. Please go ahead.

82
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
Tell Zhao Wudi to go to the CEO's office.

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,280
How dare you pull the long face!

84
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,720
Be serious.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,600
You're always drowsy at work.

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't you know why I become like this?

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,120
It's because at night...

88
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
Miss Shen, I'll get out of here

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
if there's nothing else.

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,560
Make it clear.
What have I done to you at night?

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
You make me sleep on the sofa at night.

92
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,280
I can't sleep well.

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,160
Zhao Wudi, is this your deliberate act?

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,560
Enough. Let go!

95
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,480
You showed me these photos.

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,440
Are you expecting me to protect Mr. Zhu?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,480
Yes.

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,040
No way.

99
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,160
My job is to protect you.

100
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,080
Zhao Wudi,

101
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,440
I've investigated you.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Nothing is wrong.

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,160
But this just means

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,760
something must be wrong with you.

105
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
I don't know what happened
between you and my brother.

106
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,040
Nor do I know your relationship.

107
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
But I guess

108
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
you must be sent by my brother
to protect me.

109
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
He didn't send me here.

110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
He begged me to do this.

111
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
Anyway,

112
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,320
my brother trusted you.

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,120
It suggests you're trustworthy.

114
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
What if

115
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm not a good guy?

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,600
I'll pay the price then.

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,400
The sentimental stuff can't work on me.

118
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Mr. Zhu and the two other people are

119
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
the hidden biggest shareholders
of the company.

120
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,840
But this isn't the key.

121
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
The key is that they each

122
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
have a fragment of the key.

123
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,040
The four fragments put together

124
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,720
can form a complete key.

125
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,920
And this key

126
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
is about a new energy technology

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
that can bring us ten years ahead.

128
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
I hope you can protect it well.

129
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,840
Wushuang?

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm on it now.

131
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
Wudi,

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,160
be careful.

133
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,680
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,360
Why does this one-step-later plot

135
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
always happen?

136
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,480
Hello, Han.

137
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,400
Don't you want to draw me over
by catching the man?

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Just send me the address.

139
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
Are you really Cang Ming?

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,160
Don't you already know the answer?

141
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm growing fonder of you.

142
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,760
You only wanna catch me for the bonus.

143
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,520
No,

144
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,280
I like collecting valuable things,

145
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
like you.

146
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
Zhao Wudi,

147
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,280
Cang Ming is flawed as well.

148
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,720
You may die if you go.

149
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,200
Thanks.

150
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,880
Whoa.

151
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Can you be a bit creative?

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,280
Why do you choose the same place
every time?

153
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,040
Oh yeah?

154
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,600
How should I call you? Zhao Wudi

155
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,160
or Cang Ming?

156
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Zhao Wudi,

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,920
graduated from the Bodyguard Death Camp

158
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,560
ranking first in the world,

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
outperforming the second place.

160
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
It took him one year

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,120
to hit the new record
of the Bodyguard Ranking List.

162
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,240
After Shen Xingchen died,

163
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
he replaced Shen Xingchen as the 11th
generation of Cang Ming.

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
You know I'm Cang Ming,

165
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,720
but you still treat me so casually.

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Do you despise me?

167
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
Sorry about that.

168
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,560
How about this?

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
However much money
Shen Xingyu pays you,

170
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,200
as long as you give me the key,

171
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
I'll pay you tenfold.

172
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,720
Her brother saved my life.

173
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,400
How about you come down here

174
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,320
and give me your life?

175
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,000
Back then,
although Shen Xingchen saved you,

176
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,040
there are still three pieces of shrapnel
in your body.

177
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,960
So, you have to sleep a lot every day

178
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,840
to suppress the pain.

179
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't know why you

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
don't take them out,

181
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,840
but I know

182
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,640
this is your biggest flaw.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,680
Enjoy it.

184
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,400
This is the gift for you.

♪You are God's fallen angel♪

186
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,140
