00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,360
Zhao Wudi,

2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,600
you're a swift knife

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,040
and so is Shen Xingchen.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,200
But a swift knife
is not necessarily a good knife.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,080
A good knife

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,920
should never have their own thoughts.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,320
You two think too much.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,920
So, you're here on behalf
of that invisible hand.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
Stop giving me that nonsense.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,480
Hand over the real information
on Wushuang.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,720
I can decide

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,960
to give you a quick death.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,760
For Wushuang,

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,720
you all would go to great lengths.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,880
For Wushuang,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,280
we would sacrifice money, materials,

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
and even lives.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,310
Look at me.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,440
Do I look scared?

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,920
You don't.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,560
Zhao Wudi,

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880

You're good at acting.

Stop your nonsense.

If I weren't a security guard,

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,800
I'd be filming at the Heng Dian World Studios

You?

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,160
You'd only be an extra, at best.

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,320
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Ali,

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
can buy no action from me.

Wudi,

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
how about something for me?

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,960
Wanna get on the Gray Zone?

59
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,920
Fight well.

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,920
Oh, no.

What are you looking at?

62
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,920
Get in.

Not bad, fatty.

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,520
So, can you add me on WeChat now?

73

79
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840

the people I offended

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,560
would point a gun to my head

91
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,480
if I walked freely in public.

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,640
What if you have another chance to choose?

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,520
Then, I will hold onto it.

94
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,920
