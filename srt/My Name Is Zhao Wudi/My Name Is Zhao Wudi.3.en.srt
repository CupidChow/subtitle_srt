1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,920
Not even a pot?

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,200
I didn't order this much.

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,680
I did.

4
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,700
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 3=

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,080
You're too kind.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,650
You shouldn't have ordered
so much good food for me.

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,880
I didn't say it's for you.

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,440
I thought you don't eat dinner.

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,560
I just don't feel like eating,
and I'm not on a diet.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,560
As a billionaire CEO,

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,080
it's fine to dine like a normal person

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
but you have unhealthy eating habits.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,760
- These are all processed food.
- It's none of your business.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,240
Barbecues are carcinogenic.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,320
Female CEOs must love their bodies.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,160
So, I'm gonna

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,120
help you eat these.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,520
No.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
This luosifen is my favorite.
Don't even think about it.

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,880
Share it with me.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,400
Not this too.

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,080
- Barbecue is fine, right?
- Not that too.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,320
I'll just eat what I bought.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,720
Omelet wrap.

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
It has eggs, so you can't eat it.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,360
How do you know I'm allergic to eggs?

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,560
I know a lot about you.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,800
They want evidence of a fake marriage?

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,880
I can't stand their romantic dinner.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
What are they saying?
I can't hear them.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,360
Now that we're full,
shall we do something fun?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,760
I can't, I can't.

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,840
I really can't take this anymore.

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,200
No more, is it?

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,040
I really can't.

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm quitting this job.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
Who was it that allowed me
to do anything I want?

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,920
I really can't take this anymore.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,280
I really can't.

40
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,040
Liu.

41
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
Ling, what are you doing here?

42
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm here for an interview
at the research department.

43
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,560
Why didn't you tell me about this?

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,360
What's there to tell you about?

45
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,640
Okay. Since you're already here,

46
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
I'll use my connections

47
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
and get you in through the backdoor.

48
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
What connections
does a security guard have?

49
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,110
Who are you looking down on?

50
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,920
So what if I'm a security guard?
Follow me.

51
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
Look how big my company is.

52
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,640
- It's big.
- Everyone listens to me.

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,040
You're amazing.

54
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
Wudi.

55
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,840
Wudi.

56
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,440
Wudi.

57
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,400
Out of my way.

58
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,240
Allow me to introduce.

59
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,520
My sister, Ma Ling.

60
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
- Ma Ling.
- He is the head of security, Zhao Wudi.

61
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,760
My sister is here for an interview.

62
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
You married the boss

63
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
so that kinda
makes you the boss too, right?

64
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,400
Since we're on guard duty together,

65
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,440
that makes us brothers-in-arms.

66
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Can you talk to Miss Shen

67
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,240
and help her out?

68
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,360
Sure, I can help.

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
- Hello, Ma Ling. I'm Zhao Wudi.
- Wudi.

70
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
You're already married.

71
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,240
My sister is off-limits.

72
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
Your sister is my sister.

73
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,520
I'll help our sister out.

74
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
My sister.

75
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,240
Your sister.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
Fine, you help her out.

77
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,560
You help her.

78
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
I do it, right?

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
So, what are we waiting for?

80
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,280
Follow me.

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,240
- Thank you, Wudi.
- It's fine. Come on.

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,320
Oh, yes. Stay on watch here.

83
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,640
Come on.

84
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,320
Zhao Wudi, you...

85
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,800
Your sister.

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,240
Come in.

87
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
Honey.

88
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Why are you here?

89
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
Here to recommend someone.

90
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,560
A friend's sister.

91
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
Has she taken the written test?

92
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
- She did. All that's left is the interview.
- Where is she?

93
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
She's waiting outside.

94
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,240
You're the first person

95
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,360
who tries the backdoor approach with me.

96
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,640
There's no point in doing so.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
The company has rules,
and we prioritize ability.

98
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,120
Her name is Ma Ling.
She is Ma Liu's sister.

99
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,520
He's that fatty who works with me.

100
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
Don't reject her in a hurry.

101
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,840
Her results are pretty good.

102
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,720
So, she's in?

103
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,640
What's this? Do you like her?

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
Let me remind you.

105
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,240
We have three rules between us.

106
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,760
We will not interfere
in each other's love life.

107
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,240
Then, I'll remind you too.

108
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,120
The research department has its own rules.

109
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,000
If an employee is dating,
they must inform the company

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
to prevent honey traps

111
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
or handsome traps.

112
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,560
That's fine. I may be very handsome,

113
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,720
but I'm very dependable.

114
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,760
Creep.

116
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
You must be Jiang Wanshan.
