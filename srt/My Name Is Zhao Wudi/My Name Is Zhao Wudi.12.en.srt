1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,110
Honey.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,480
I made you noodles.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,720
Where did you get that egg?

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,520
I bought it.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,040
You're allergic to eggs,

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,920
but I'm not.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,520
Besides, didn't I get injured recently?

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
I need the proteins

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,680
for my body.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,200
Eat your noodles.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,280
Don't you think wearing that
is inappropriate?

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,600
Not at all.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Why?

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Stop looking.
Your noodles are getting cold.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,680
For the sake of
this bowl of noodles you made,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,040
I'll waive the 2 million
I mentioned yesterday.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,320
Really?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,800
You're overthinking it.

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,640
The company's equity ownership change
will be completed in a month.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,400
After our contract ends,

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,720
you'll be free.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,120
Must you be that cold?

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,740
You'd have feelings too
if you adopted a cat.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,000
What if

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,890
I wanna extend the contract?

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,560
Then, that'll depend on me.

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,840
Hello.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,920
Xingyu, terrible news. Han Renxin is now
the second largest shareholder

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,560
and has started to condemn you.

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,500
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 12=

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,600
Miss Shen.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Han Renxin is now
the second largest shareholder.

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,960
He is condemning you

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,680
to prevent the equity ownership change.

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,480
Who are the shareholders
participating in the change?

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
How did he get their shares?

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
He must have used some illegal methods

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
to buy from smaller shareholders.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
Should we call the police?

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,640
We can't.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,160
Firstly, we have no proof.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Secondly, if there is a dispute,

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,600
the equity ownership change
will be set aside.

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,600
That is their goal.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,280
The only way out of this situation is

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
to find the share certificate
my brother left behind.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
But my brother left too suddenly.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't know where they are.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Are you sure Xingchen
kept the share certificate in this city?

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm sure.

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,360
It won't be in Shen Group

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,680
or Xingyu Optoelectronics.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,880
Wudi, I won't sneak shots of you again.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
I'll report to Miss Shen later

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,920
that I'm quitting it.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,120
Don't do that.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
We can make money together.

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,240
It's pretty good.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,600
Wudi, are you serious?

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,800
From now on,
you will take photos when I tell you to.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Don't give Miss Shen troubles.

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
Be a good double agent.

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,160
You're making things difficult for me.

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,240
I have a question for you.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,600
If your dad is a billionaire

66
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,360
and left you a huge fortune,

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
where would you hide it?

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,520
The bank.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
Isn't the bank the safest place?

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,320
You Ming,

71
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,640
take this

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,240
to my sister.

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Take care of her.

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
Protect Wushuang in her place.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
And this string of numbers.

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,200
You must memorize it.

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
It's very important.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
If my dad is a billionaire,

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,880
I wouldn't be working here
as a security guard.

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
Why are you angry?

81
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
Is your dad a billionaire?

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,120
Miss Shen, we've been waiting for you.

83
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,890
You became
the second largest shareholder overnight.

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,320
Not bad, Mr. Han.

85
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't misunderstand, Miss Shen.

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,920
I play by the rules of reason and law.

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's begin.

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
(Delay him for an hour.)

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
(I have an idea.)

90
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,740
(Technology Center)

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Sir, I won't come in next time.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,160
- Is your bike fully charged?
- It is.

93
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,880
Do you know me?

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,960
Yes, yes.

95
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
You stay here and lend me your bike.

96
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll give you 1,000 when I get back.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,080
Okay.

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Miss Shen, do you have any objections?

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,360
I need an explanation
from the first point onward.

101
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,280
Very detailed explanation.

102
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
Are you buying time?

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,920
That's right.

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
But I am following the rules, aren't I?

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,480
That's right.

106
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,280
When I say we go by the rules,

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,000
I meant while we're inside this building.

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
The rules might not matter

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,520
outside this building.

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,520
What do you mean?

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,480
Mr. Zhao must be at the bank right now.

112
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,260
(Negotiation Room)

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,560
You take a long time
to verify a person's identity.

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,240
Your efficiency is really low.

115
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Sir,

116
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,400
you want to open
safety deposit box No. 001

117
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
and you aren't client's next of kin.

118
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
I really cannot help you open it.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,160
As I recall, you identify by the password
rather than the person.

120
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,280
When did you start
making things difficult for others?

121
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Sir,

122
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
these are important certificates.

123
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,680
Aren't I also responsible to you?

124
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,640
Fatty,

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,680
I never mentioned certificate.

126
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
How did you know?

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,000
You...

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,440
I don't care who paid you.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
My wife is being bullied right now.

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
If she wants to play by the rules,
I'll help her by the rules.

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
If you wanna play dirty,
I'm more than ready.

132
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,080
This is my last warning.

133
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,920
I'll count to three.

134
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
Give it to me.

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,200
Who do you think you are?

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,680
Security!

137
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,640
I am the security.

138
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,160
You have no chance.

139
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,980
- You...
- Stop.

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,360
Mr. President.

141
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,920
He wants to rob the bank.

142
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
Haven't I repeated this?

143
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,520
If the customer of No. 001 comes,

144
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,720
I must personally receive him.

145
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,120
If someone hadn't told me,

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
I'd be doomed because of you.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
You're fired.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
Get out of here.

149
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,280
Mr. President.

150
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,520
Sir, come with me.

151
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,560
Mr. President.

152
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,920
Mr. President.

153
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,160
Wudi, Miss Shen and the others are
submitting their share certificates.

154
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,280
The other party already
has 42% of the total shares.

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,800
If you can't deliver

156
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Mr. Shen's share certificates
within 15 minutes,

157
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,200
Mr. Han will have full control
over Xingyu Optoelectronics.

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,080
Even if we regain control,

159
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,200
we'll lose all technical data

160
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,280
in the R&D department.

161
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
Okay, I got it.

162
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
It's almost time, Miss Shen.

163
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
If you don't have solid proof,

164
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,280
let's proceed to a vote
by show of hands.

165
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,840
You cannot enter.

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,800
My apologies.

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,400
Why do you apologize?

168
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,840
I'm in a hurry,

169
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,320
so I may not hold back.

170
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,800
So, I'm apologizing in advance.

171
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,640
Excuse me.

172
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,700
(Certificate of Equity Ownership)
I've kept you waiting, Miss Shen.

173
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,440
This is proof of my brother
Shen Xingchen's equity ownership

174
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,240
and documents authorizing me
as the trustee.

175
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,600
Mr. Han, you may get out of
the board of directors.

176
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Shen Xingyu,

177
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,840
although your total equity exceeds mine,

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,280
it is still less than half.

179
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,280
It is clearly stated here

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,480
that you must own
more than 50% of the shares

181
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
to have the right to dispose of
the second largest shareholder.

182
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
You don't qualify.

183
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
She qualifies.

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,760
I, Zhu Xing,
am the final hidden shareholder.

185
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
Didn't you want to lure me out?

186
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,920
(Zhu Xing)

187
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,500
(Xingyu Optoelectronics Shareholder)
Here I am.

188
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,360
Mr. Zhu.

189
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
Mr. Zhu,

190
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,120
I didn't expect it would be you.

191
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,520
Many things are out of your expectations.

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,560
Xingyu, draft a transfer contract.

193
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm transferring all my shares to you.

194
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
Why, Mr. Zhu?

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
I'd rest easy leaving them in your hands.

196
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,120
After all, you have a good bodyguard.

197
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Han,

198
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,200
from now on,

199
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,100
you will not get involved
in the company's development.

200
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I will distribute

201
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,480
your dividends on time.

202
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,920
I underestimated you, Zhao Wudi.

203
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
You're more annoying than a bedbug.

204
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,520
You disturbed my sleep.

205
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,520
Mr. Zhu, please have a seat.

206
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Now,

207
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,880
we can get down to business.

208
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,720
Mr. Han,

209
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
(Zhao Wudi)
we discovered that Zhao Wudi is Cang Ming.

210
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,640
(Cang Ming; Ranked No.1 on Gray Zone)

211
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
This guy hid himself very well.

212
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,480
But we still failed.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
No, we succeeded.

214
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,120
The shares weren't important at all.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,580
I came here for two goals.

216
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,720
Firstly,

217
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
to find the invisible shareholder
holding the third key.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,280
Secondly, to uncover Zhao Wudi's identity.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Both were accomplished.

220
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
So,

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,280
what should we do next?

222
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,200
Keep an eye on Mr. Zhu.

223
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,040
Then, sell the information that Zhao Wudi
is Cang Ming to the Gray Zone.

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,760
We can take our hands off the rest.
