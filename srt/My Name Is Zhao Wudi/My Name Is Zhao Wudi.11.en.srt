1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,560
Do you wanna drink?

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,040
Yes, of course.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,680
Wait until I swallow first.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,160
Mr. Han.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,000
Someone added the bounty on Zhao Wudi.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,860
He is currently ranked 20th
at 500,000 dollars.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Looks like someone loves him
more than we do.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,480
With greater reward,
there will be braver men.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,800
After dealing with
many assassination attempts,

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,360
Zhao Wudi will reveal his weakness.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,360
We will strike him down then.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,930
Have you confirmed the identity
of the last shareholder?

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,680
Not yet.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,280
We looked into many people

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,640
but none of them is the one.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,360
Acquire all shares
from the smaller shareholders

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,320
and then force Shen Xingyu out.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,680
What if they won't sell?

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,240
Do I have to tell you what to do?

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,660
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 11=

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,320
Wudi, look.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,360
You ranked 20th.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,760
500,000 dollars?

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,760
Who is generous enough

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
to spend money on you?

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,920
What did you do?

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,760
- Look, look.
- Liu.

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,480
You're so noisy.

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,680
Look at this.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,480
500,000 dollars.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,080
I didn't know

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
so many people love me.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,800
Sure, they do.

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,160
They'd love to have you dead.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,040
When you lie down next to me,

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,140
doesn't that mean I have 500,000 dollars
piled up next to me?

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
I can't hold back

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,840
my gigantic sword anymore. I wanna...

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Liu, if you aren't afraid of dying,

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,240
go right ahead.

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
I treasure my life.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,680
Hello, Ling.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Where is Xingyu?

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,120
Miss Shen just went out.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,800
Okay.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm heading out.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,960
Stay here.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,120
Wait, where are you going?

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,900
(Midas Steel)

50
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,980
(Surprise Inside)

51
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,920
Zhao Wudi, does this count as a surprise?

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,680
They say all on the Gray Zone
are skilled fighters.

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,680
I'll give you a chance.

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll give you one minute.

55
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,760
If you can rescue her

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
within one minute,

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,400
then I give up on
the 500,000 dollar bounty

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
on your head.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,720
Don't move.

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,320
If you can't rescue her,

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,960
then you'll suffer a double loss.

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,680
It's getting late.

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,480
Let the show begin.

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,960
Don't come closer.

65
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,600
Fine.

66
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,760
You're much faster than I expected.

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,800
Zhao Wudi,

68
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,480
your strength

69
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
could place you in the top three
on the Gray Zone.

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,280
Fine.

71
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,760
I'll give up on the 500,000 dollars.

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll give her back to you, too.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,080
Let's go.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
I wish you a happy wedding

75
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,560
and may your marriage last.

76
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Okay, drop the act.

77
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,440
You knew this is a trap.

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,880
Why did you come?

79
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,320
So, do you also want the bounty?

80
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Take a guess.

81
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,120
In any case, I did you a huge favor.

82
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,600
I didn't make you wait too long.

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,000
If it weren't for me,

84
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,360
Shen Xingyu would've been captured.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,440
Thank you.

86
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,520
Is this how you thank me?

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
Lend me your shoulder.

88
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay, Liu.

89
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,520
Come out.

90
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,360
Wudi.

91
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,520
How did you know it was me?

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,360
I thought I hid myself quite well.

93
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
You've been working for Xingyu

94
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,360
ever since we got married, right?

95
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm just making extra cash.

96
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,200
I won't expose you.

97
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,000
But we'll split the money.

98
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,080
No.

99
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,240
I've spent most of it.

100
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
Then, delete the photos you just took.

101
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,240
Too late.

102
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,600
Miss Shen has probably seen them.

103
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,680
Looks like you're in another trouble.

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,400
Zhao Wudi, see you.

105
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,240
Gorgeous, add me on WeChat.

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,040
I don't like worthless things.

107
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,800
What did you say?

108
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
So what if you're a pretty face?

109
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,200
(Xingyu Optoelectronics Shareholder)

110
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,280
(Wang Dafa)
How was that, Mr. Wang?

111
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
Did that clear your mind?

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,120
30%.

113
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,540
Jie, Mr. Wang hasn't made up his mind.

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,320
50%.

115
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,910
What are you waiting for?

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,520
Hurry up and bandage his hands.

117
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,600
How is he gonna sign the contract?

118
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
With this 3%,

119
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
I can call
for a board of directors meeting, right?

120
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,400
Anytime.

121
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
If Shen Xingyu is unable to produce
her brother's share certificate,

122
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,760
I will have the final say
in Xingyu Optoelectronics after tomorrow.

123
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,740
- Honey, let me explain.
- Get out.

124
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,440
Ours is a contract marriage.

125
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,520
You're not in love with me, are you?

126
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
You're overthinking it.

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,240
I just want to remind you this.

128
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,920
It's written in our contract

129
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,040
that you're not allowed to hit on a woman
during the duration of the contract.

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
I thought you got kidnapped.

131
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,520
I went to save you.

132
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,320
I got injured all over.

133
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,600
Everywhere aches.

134
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
My finger aches.

135
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,400
My heart aches.

136
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
My stomach aches.

137
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
My head aches, too.

138
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,720
You had it coming.

139
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,200
Zhao Wudi, I'm telling you.

140
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,560
If you're in pain, go to the hospital.

141
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,840
Pay the medical bill yourself.

142
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,640
However, the penalty
for breaching our contract is 2 million.

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,480
Tell your Mary and Sue
to prepare it for you.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
2 million?

145
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,040
