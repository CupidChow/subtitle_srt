1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,880
Xingyu, you're awake.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,200
I really didn't know
you're allergic to eggs.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
Have a drink.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,880
I don't want to drink.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,480
Xingyu, I know you won't forgive me

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,720
but I still wanna apologize.

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,040
I let you down.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,920
I told you this before,

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,560
until death do us part.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,720
But Han Renxin used my sister's life

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,960
and your future to threaten me.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,960
I didn't have a choice.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,320
I could only do as he said.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,160
I had a dream

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,960
to grow old with you

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,200
but that dream...

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,400
Say anymore and I'll vomit.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,880
Honey.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
You got pregnant so soon?

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,960
I brought your favorite braised pork.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,880
What should we name our child?

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,520
If it's a boy,

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,160
how about Zhao Jingzi?

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,360
He can look into the mirror every day

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,200
and take a long hard look at himself.

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,600
Well,

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,240
Xingyu, I'm leaving now.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Take a good rest.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
That was good acting.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,480
Not better than you.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
You knew he's a terrible person

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,040
but you had to play along.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,960
So, aren't you glad you got hospitalized?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
Feeling heartache for me?

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,880
I just think

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,880
this wasn't necessary.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
What did you mean?

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,640
That Li Xian

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
managed to get connected with Qatar Group.

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
If I want to get rid of him,

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
I need to find hard evidence.

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,760
So, you put yourself in danger

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
and risked your life.

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,880
That's your problem.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,720
It's your duty to protect me.

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,600
If something happens to me,

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
that means you failed your duty.

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,200
Fine.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,440
I'll get rid of hidden dangers
for you now.

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Zhao Wudi, come back.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
You're my bodyguard.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,680
(Han Renxin)
Human organs are in high demand lately.

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
Your sister looks healthy.

54
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
I think I can removed a lot from her.

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
Mr. Han, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,960
Please give me another chance.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
I will get it right next time.

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,080
Useless.

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,480
Since Shen Xingyu is doing this
for sake of the company,

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,080
then I should help her.

61
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,520
Listen well.

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,760
Okay.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,100
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 10=

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
Wudi, don't sleep.

65
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,320
Grab those red packets.

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,440
I got fifty over. Look.

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Who sent it?

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,160
It's Li Xian, who previously stole from
our company before.

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,680
He is now the special liaison
for Qatar Group.

70
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,720
This fellow tries to socialize
with everyone as soon as he arrives.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,880
Wudi, this won't do.

72
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,600
We can't fall behind.
You gotta send some too.

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
And send bigger red packets.

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Get out.

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Why are you so stingy?

76
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,420
He brought a project worth 80 million
as soon as he came back.

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,120
This is a counterattack.

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
You've gotta have a sense of crisis.

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,200
Don't sleep and get to work.

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,040
That's really a huge project.

81
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,340
(Xingyu Optoelectronics Corporation)

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,600
Cut down on the milk tea.

83
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,520
Which department are you from?

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,340
Did the company pay you to date at work?

85
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,160
Aren't you the kept husband?

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,040
You aren't dating?
You're the mistress?

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,320
Why are you back again?

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,400
Special liaison for Qatar Group.

89
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,160
Liaison?

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
So, he's just like a phone.

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
No wonder I feel like slamming you.

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,680
Who recruited you?

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,880
Recruiting someone like you

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,200
is a disgrace to Xingyu Optoelectronics.

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,760
You're barbaric and rude.

96
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
I was specially appointed
by the Qatar Group to assist Shen Xingyu.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,360
Does your nose still hurt?

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,520
Do you still remember
how your blood flowed?

99
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,120
A friend in need is a friend indeed

100
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,280
but I saved Shen Xingyu.

101
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,840
Forget it.

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't have time to talk
to a mere security guard.

103
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,800
Stand on guard and watch your attitude.

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,480
Mr. Ex-husband, good luck.

105
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,040
What are you talking about?

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
If he patches things up with Xingyu,

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,120
wouldn't you be freed?

108
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,960
Go, go back to work.

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,760
Bye-bye.

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,160
The document you sent me
needs to be revised.

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,720
Xingyu, did you rest well?

112
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,240
It's working hours now.

113
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
I happen to have a serious matter

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,080
to report to you.

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
Zhao Wudi from the security department

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,960
has been misusing his working hours

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,280
and behaving suspiciously
with your secretary.

118
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
Miss Shen, I didn't.

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,000
The Miss sent you here

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,140
as a liaison between
Xingyu Optoelectronics and Qatar Group,

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,840
not as our disciplinary council member.

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,720
I've read all the plans you've submitted.

123
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,600
None are up to par.

124
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,680
Redo everything.

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,120
What are you waiting for?

126
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,920
Go.

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,640
Xingyu,

128
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,600
you won't think I was too harsh, right?

129
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Of course not.

130
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
The company needs

131
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,880
such demanding and strict professionalism.

132
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm glad you understand.

133
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
This 80 million project

134
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,240
is crucial for the company.

135
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,080
We must work together to push it forward.

136
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,640
Excuse me.

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,840
Captain Zhao, what are you doing here?

138
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,360
It's a routine inspection
to ensure safety.

139
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I can't talk to a barbarian like you.

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,080
Xingyu, where were we?

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,560
Oh, yes. To push it forward,

142
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,440
I think we should spend more time together.

143
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
No, not should.

144
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,240
We must spend more time together.

145
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,280
You saved me

146
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,560
and helped the company
win a project worth 80 million.

147
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,600
How about this?

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
To express my gratitude,

149
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
I'll treat you to dinner.

150
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,280
Sure.

151
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,320
Wudi, how can you bear with this?

152
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
Just like a mayfly,
it only survives for a short while.

153
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,720
Back to work.

154
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
Xingyu, what do you wanna eat?

155
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,160
Whatever.

156
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,900
How about that restaurant
we went to in the past?

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,840
We don't have a past.

158
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
In that case, let's look forward

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,000
and forge a better future together.

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,220
After all, I am the special liaison
sent by Qatar Group.

161
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,700
We will have more chances
to keep in touch.

162
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,940
(Zhao Wudi: Okay)

163
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,240
You're overthinking this.

164
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,600
Li Xian, you're fired.

165
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,280
Xingyu, stop joking.

166
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,480
I know you don't like me

167
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,760
but I was sent by the Qatar Group.

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
You can't stop me.

169
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,680
Hello, Miss.

170
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,480
You meanie.

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,800
You and Han Renxin lied to me
and want to harm my master's wife.

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,640
I almost couldn't study under Master.

173
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm telling you, you're fired.

174
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,840
No, I can explain. Hello?

175
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,200
You reap what you sow.

176
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
As Han Renxin's lapdog,

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
you might not even know
where you would end up.

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
No, Xingyu.

179
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
I've been forced to do this.

180
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,360
Han Renxin is using my sister's life
to threaten me.

181
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Tell that

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
to the police at the station.

183
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,760
We dealt with Li Xian.

184
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
Shouldn't we deal with your problem now?

185
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,640
I still have a score to settle with you.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
As my bodyguard,

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
you were indifferent
to the fact that I'm going to dinner

188
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,040
alone with Li Xian.

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,480
Are you creating a sense of crisis in me?

190
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'm questioning your ability
to do your job.

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,360
My ability to do my job?

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,280
What are you doing? Put me down.

193
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,960
Will a single arm press
with 50 kg weight prove it?

194
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
Put me down now.

195
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,760
Didn't you wanna test my ability to work?

196
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Put me down.

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,400
I'll settle this with you
when we get home.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,680
You haven't informed me

199
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,720
about the time
you met up with the daughter

200
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,560
of the Qatar Group in private.

201
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
Jealous?

202
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,240
I'm just asking you to report back.

203
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,000
Miss Shen's way of requesting a report

204
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,400
is very unique.

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
I have a more unique way.

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Do you wanna know?

207
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm not seeing anything.

208
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Do continue.

209
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,240
What is it?

210
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,520
Mr. Han, Li Xian got arrested.

211
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,280
Tell them to stop everything.

212
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,720
Activate the next plan.

213
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,740
You must find information
about the mysterious shareholders.

214
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,760
Yes, sir.

215
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,880
Li Xian's case

216
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
is now over.

217
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,480
You haven't eaten dinner.

218
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,200
So, I made you

219
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,160
your favorite luosifen.

220
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,000
What about you?

221
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm not hungry.

222
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,840
Let's eat together.

223
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,080
Who is it?

224
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh, no.

225
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
- What's wrong?
- Something happened to Mr. Zheng.

226
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,880
Mr. Zheng?

227
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,400
He is the other mysterious shareholder.

228
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
The enemy's goal is clear.

229
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,240
We have to be more vigilant from now on.

230
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
Xingyu Optoelectronics

231
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
