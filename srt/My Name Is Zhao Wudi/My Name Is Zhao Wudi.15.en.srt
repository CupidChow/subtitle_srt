1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,400
Miss Shen.

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,040
Where's Zhao Wudi?

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,800
He was reading the materials here before.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,920
I got back after buying the coffee...

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,640
Miss Shen, here you are.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,040
What's with the hotel?

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,470
I don't know.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,360
This is the information copied from
the Han family.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,280
Wudi said Han was merely a pawn.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,800
He plans to find out who's behind this.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:58,300
(Rainbow Hotel)

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,440
(You came quite fast.)

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,040
Who are you?

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,280
(Rainbow Hotel)

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
(is the clue I left for you.)

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
(Cang Ming.)

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,000
(Mr. Han is a brainless idiot,)

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,640
(but he's finally done something nice.)

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,320
(He found out your true identity.)

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I've got here.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
Why are you still hiding?

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,240
Such a trap isn't fun.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,960
(No, no.)

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,400
(Next is the fun part.)

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,760
(A squad was sent to execute the task,)

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
(but only you came back alive.)

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,480
(How do you feel about this?)

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,160
What has this got to do

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
with you?

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,080
(Shen Xingchen is a tough guy.)

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
(He'd rather die than come clean.)

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,920
(You're the only person he met
before he died.)

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,680
(So, Wushuang must be in your hands.)

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,760
(Give me Wushuang)

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,400
(and I'll let you die with a full body.)

36
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,480
Indeed, you're doing this for Wushuang.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
Let's talk face to face then.

38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,900
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 15=

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,720
Hello.

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,280
Okay, I got it.

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,040
I'll be there now.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,320
Ma Ling.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Miss Shen, what's the matter?

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,080
My uncle asked me to go meet him,

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,520
saying Xingyu Optoelectronics has got
serious financial problems.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,480
No kidding.

47
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,240
The financial situation
is always kept in order.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
Nothing can be wrong.

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Besides,

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,400
even if it has any problems,

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,120
it has nothing to do with the Group.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,560
I assume it can't be that simple.

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,200
Did you reach Zhao Wudi?

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,480
No, he isn't answering his phone.

55
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,120
Never mind. I'll go there now.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,160
Ali, why are you here?

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,320
(The smoke is deadly poisonous.)

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,680
(The poison will take effect
in one minute.)

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,800
(There are two antidotes on the table.)

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
(One is real and the other is fake.)

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
(You'll identify them yourselves.)

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,640
Pick one. I don't wanna die.

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,760
You can eat it if you wanna die.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,960
But I'll die if I don't eat it.

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
Then I'll die with you.

66
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
(Good.)

67
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,750
(How did you recognize it?)

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,160
The two pills smell the same.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
So, the smoke isn't poisonous.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
The pills are poisonous.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,600
If you're in on this scheme against me,

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,120
that'll be too boring.

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,640
You've known it.

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,040
It looks like you didn't touch the pills.

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,800
But your hand does smell of them.

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
So, the pills were placed there by you.

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
I was acting cooperatively just now.

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,280
I knew you wouldn't buy that.

79
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,480
Don't play this kind of trick again.

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
It's a waste of time.

81
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
Is it?

82
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,480
I think it's fun.

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
If your beautiful hand

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,720
gets some corrosive poison on it,

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
my face will be ruined.

86
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,440
How can I bear to ruin

87
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,600
this pretty face?

88
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,480
What do you know

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
about Dragon Slaying Action?

90
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
Never heard of it.

91
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,640
I only know

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,880
Trapping Dragon Action.

93
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,040
I can leave anytime if I want to.

94
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,320
These tricks can't keep me.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,520
Zhao Wudi,

96
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,280
you should know trapping you
isn't our goal.

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,400
More importantly,

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
it's a distraction.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
Your target is Xingyu Optoelectronics?

100
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,640
We're not that petty.

101
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
We're gonna take down the Shen Group.

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,960
Nothing's wrong with the finance
of Xingyu Optoelectronics.

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,400
Even if there is,
you don't have to worry about it.

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
No problem with the financial situation

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,840
doesn't mean no other problems.

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Anyway, Xingyu Optoelectronics

107
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,560
was a part of the Shen Group.

108
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,000
They're somewhat related.

109
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
My brother got Xingyu Optoelectronics

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,260
at the cost of giving up
the right of inheritance.

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,960
It has nothing to do with the Shen family.

112
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,880
The ties of blood can't be cut off.

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,360
We merely want to help you.

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,280
When you forced my brother to leave,

115
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
you showed no regard
for the ties of blood at all.

116
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,480
That's a family affair.

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
You'd rather
accept an outsider's investment

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,480
than the purchase of your family.

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,400
Then it won't be a family affair.

120
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,680
Let's do it business-wise.

121
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
You want the shares? Sure,

122
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,990
but no intervening in the management.

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
I just hope you can come back.

124
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
I've underestimated your goal.

125
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,320
Turns out you're not coming for the shares.

126
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,960
Instead,
you want to get the company for nothing.

127
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,680
You...

128
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,560
Our family has spent
so many resources on you.

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
How can you not have a heart at all?

130
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll call you uncle for the last time.

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,600
I hope you can understand

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,840
it's that the family
is in my brother's debt.

133
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
My brother and I

134
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,000
owe the Shen family nothing.

135
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,120
You...

136
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
Stop it.

137
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,600
Brother, you're old.

138
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
It's time for you to rest.

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,880
Hello.

140
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
(Uncle Shen died of a heart attack.)

141
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,080
You woke up so quickly.

142
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,960
Cang Ming of Black Bat indeed.

143
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,280
Turns out you're Mr. Hu.

144
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,440
The plan has worked.

145
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,640
It's time to meet you then.

146
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,720
What on earth are you up to?

147
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
The former chairman was old

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,080
and disobedient.

149
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,560
So, I sent him to hell.

150
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
The current chairman, Shen Zhongtian,

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,280
is my man.

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,280
How scheming of you!

153
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
You've got such a submissive pawn.

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,200
Yeah, that's right.

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,240
I like playing chess.

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
You're a good pawn too.

157
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
