1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,000
How did you find those listening devices?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,720
You asked me too many times.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,720
I just do.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,510
- Based on my experience and intuition.
- I don't believe you.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,200
What did you do before this?

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,230
Security.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,760
What I train is my experience,
intuition, and eyesight.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,720
Eyesight and intuition?

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,800
Use your eyesight and intuition

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,360
to look at these lipstick colors.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
I can't tell the colors apart,

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
but if you appear in front of me with one,

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,960
I'll know which one it is.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,560
Okay.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,800
Lower.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,920
This one.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,320
Second row, fourth one.

18
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,720
- You...
- What?

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,320
Are you disappointed I didn't kiss you?

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,520
You lost.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,720
You didn't specify which lipstick this is.

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,720
No. The one you applied

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,880
isn't even in the box just now.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,120
I won.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,320
What's my reward?

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,900
A reward?

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,720
How about this for a reward?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,280
No. No, honey.

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,200
We're a loving couple with mutual respect.

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,950
There are people watching us.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,600
You added this scene to the act.
Go and draw the curtains.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
I'll go. Let me go first.

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,380
Go on.

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,020
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 5=

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,960
(For me, it isn't about
the number of people. It depends on luck.)

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,440
(The hiding spots are too stereotypical)

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,080
(and affect the listening quality.)

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,720
(You should change
your security consultant.)

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,440
Stop staring at me. I'm a man of virtue.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you crazy? Get out of my way.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Wait.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Why are there so many injuries
on your body?

43
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,880
- Does your heart ache?
- Get out.

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,320
He must already have noticed us
monitoring them.

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Have you looked into his background?

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,920
I've investigated this kid.

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,240
His family background is clean
without any suspicion.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,960
Having none is the biggest suspicion.

49
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,920
I am certain

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,200
that Zhao Wudi isn't his real name.

51
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,210
I'll send someone to look deeper.

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,480
Contact Han Renxin.

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,040
It's time for him to act.

54
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Understood.

55
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,300
- Ling.
- Wudi.

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,520
Ling, what are you doing here?

57
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,320
I got into the research department.

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,360
I didn't have time that last time
to properly thank you.

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Here, I got you coffee.

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,680
Thanks, sis.

61
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,920
You're welcome.

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Miss Shen has high hopes of you.

63
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,080
You need to work hard, okay?

64
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
Don't be like your brother.

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,440
He looks sloppy all day long.

66
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
Don't worry.

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
Who is sloppy?

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
Save me some respect here.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,800
Sis, listen to my advice.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Stay away from married men
like him, you hear me?

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,200
You worked so hard

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
to join the research department.

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,840
Don't make one mistake
and regret it forever.

74
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Liu, it's not the same era anymore.

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
Don't be so old-fashioned.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,640
Wudi, I'm off to work.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,440
Take care.

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,160
Bye-bye.

79
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
Zhao Wudi, I'm warning you.

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,640
Don't flirt with my sister again,
you hear me?

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,280
She gets along very well with Miss Shen.
Miss Shen takes her everywhere.

82
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
If you dare flirt with her again...

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,440
Fine, brother-in-law.

84
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm tired. I'm gonna sleep.

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
Who are you calling brother-in-law?

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,720
Sorry about that.

87
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't sleep. It's time to get off work.

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,920
If my wife doesn't leave, how can I leave?

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
Being affectionate, are you?

90
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
You're just a henpecked husband.

91
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,320
At home, I abide by four words.

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
I keep my word.

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Do you dare swear on it?
If you lie, the power will trip.

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,720
I swear it.

95
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,720
Miss Shen, there's a power outage.

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
The backup power is out, too.

97
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,240
The firewall is down. Someone is trying
to hack into the company's server.

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,560
The main power was cut from outside.

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,120
You mean someone sabotaged it?

100
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
- Let's check it out.
- Let's go.

101
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
No one in the security department
picked up. Come with me.

102
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,050
(Warning)

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,160
Ma Liu.

104
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,440
Follow me closely.

105
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,120
Ma Ling.

106
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,680
Ma Ling.

107
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,520
Ma Ling, you...

108
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,280
Don't move.

109
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
Those who can get in here

110
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
must be someone in the company.

111
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,120
Miss Shen, I advise you not to act rashly

112
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,520
and do as you're told.

113
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,000
