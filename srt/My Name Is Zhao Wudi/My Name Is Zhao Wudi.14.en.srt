00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,540
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 14=

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,320
Zhao Wudi,

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,440
no,

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,840
Cang Ming,

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,840
aren't you a fighter?

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
What's wrong with you today?

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,680
Still not yielding?

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,880
Fine.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,360
I'll make you succumb today.

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Then I'll get 15 million.

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
Easy-peasy.

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,600
Cang Ming, get up.

13
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
You're Cang Ming,
the top one on the Gray Zone.

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
Get up.

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
So, this is all you've got.

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,560
Looks like I came late again.

17
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,960
Not at all.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,720
Isn't this what you want?

19
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Now you have two choices.

20
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,560
One,

21
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,480
kill me

22
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
and get the reward of 15 million.

23
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,120
Two,

24
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,400
I don't wanna die,

25
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
so take me to the hospital.

26
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
I have to

27
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
think about this.

28
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,440
Such a strong guy

29
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,480
is gone.

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,920
What a pity!

31
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Zhao Wudi!

32
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
Zhao Wudi, you're scaring me, right?

33
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
Wake up!

34
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,560
Wake up!

35
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Aren't you invincible?

36
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,400
You can't die!

37
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
You big liar!

38
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,440
Didn't you promise me
you'd come back safely?

39
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
Didn't you promise my brother

40
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,560
you'd protect me forever?

41
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,400
Get up.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,760
How can you leave me widowed
at such a young age?

43
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
I've finally got married.

44
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,520
How can you be so irresponsible?

45
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
We've just got married.

46
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,280
We still have a lot of things to do.

47
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,360
You're not dead?

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
All the crying and yelling here.

49
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,760
I had no choice

50
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,560
but to wake up.

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
Then what's about this?

52
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,720
The doctor said I was fine now,

53
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,680
so the ECG monitor isn't necessary.

54
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,160
You've fooled me for so long.

55
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,960
Ouch.

56
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,040
You were confessing
your feelings to affectionately.

57
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,680
I shouldn't interrupt you recklessly.

58
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
Since you've heard it,

59
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,480
give me your answer then.

60
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
Drop the act.

61
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,400
It hurts.

62
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,080
I need to take the doctor's advice

63
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,680
and rest more.

64
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,240
Hello, we're police officers
of Haitang City.

65
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
Han Renxin,

66
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,960
you're suspected of
multiple violence cases.

67
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,080
You're under arrest now.

68
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,800
This is the arrest warrant.

69
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,920
You're doing fine.

70
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,560
You can be discharged in two days.

71
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,520
Thank you, doctor.

72
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,400
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

73
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
Now that the doctor has said that,

74
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
you can't play dumb with me again.

75
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
Regarding my question,

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,160
it's time for you to respond to me.

77
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,320
What question?

78
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,960
Fine.

79
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
It's fine that you don't remember it.

80
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,840
I can ask you again seriously.

81
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Zhao Wudi,

82
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
I like you.

83
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,600
Will you be with me?

84
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
We've been married.

85
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
Why are you asking this?

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
