1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,920
The proposal for holding the board meeting
was rejected just now.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,720
Because the board meeting
has just been held

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,520
and Shen Zhongtian became the new chairman.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,880
It'll be released tomorrow morning.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,000
Miss Shen, I'm sorry for the loss.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,200
Why weren't we informed
of the board meeting?

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,520
My uncle's death must be foul play.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,360
Go check the autopsy report.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,520
Okay, I'm on it.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,080
Sorry.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,520
The subscriber you dialed can not
be connected for the moment.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
Please redial later.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,160
Sorry.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,200
The subscriber you dialed can not
be connected for the moment.

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,820
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 16=

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,840
Congratulations, Mr. Shen.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,320
Bai, it's thanks to your help

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,960
that I've become what I am today.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
I'll do my best to assist you well.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,400
Xingyu.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,920
Congratulations.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,480
You've been the chairman

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,960
right after your brother died.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,400
Xingyu, my brother was angered
to death by you.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,840
When I left, he was fine.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,280
Xingyu.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
I know you can't accept this.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,760
My brother had a good heart,

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
but failed to manage the company well,

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,480
causing the company's performance
to drop constantly.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,320
Now, I'm in office.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
For the Group's future,

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,520
I'll definitely make it take on a new look.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,320
That's all.

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,840
Mr. Shen, how should we dispose of
Xingyu Optoelectronics?

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,800
Every person has his own boundary.

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,960
Shen Xingyu sees Xingyu Optoelectronics
as important as her life.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,280
Our goal is to obtain Wushuang.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,120
We don't have to fight to the end.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,320
Zhao Wudi isn't around today.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
Do it now.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,160
Yes.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
I have one question.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,840
Why is Wushuang so important?

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
A unit of electric quantity

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
can support a mobile phone for half a year

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
and keep a car running for 3,000 miles,

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
it can even last forever.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
This is the value of Wushuang.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,280
It's a new world-shattering technology.

51
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,640
No wonder you're trying so hard to get it.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,720
Once Wushuang is put into use,

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,400
think about it,

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
what will it bring to the world?

55
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,831
(Wife)

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,200
Zhao Wudi, pick up the call.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,520
You've got to pick up your wife's call.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,760
But my men have gone to
Xingyu Optoelectronics.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,880
If you talk wildly,

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,200
she may be in danger.

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
You finally picked up the call.
Where are you?

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,520
Honey, I'm hanging out with my friends.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,920
I'll go back later.

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,360
What's up?

65
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,040
Uncle Shen has died of a heart attack.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Protect yourself well.

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Sorry for your loss.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
Uncle Zhongtian became the new chairman.

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,280
But I smelt a rat.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
Someone has got to be in charge.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,480
Don't overthink it.

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Are you in the office?

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,720
Wait for me after work.

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,880
I'll take you
to have the mutton offal soup.

75
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,560
You'll have a lot of
your favorite cilantro.

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,240
It's gonna be really good.

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,680
Cilantro?

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
Xingyu, what do you hate to eat most?

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,070
Cilantro.

80
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
I hate the smell a lot.

81
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
Let's set a secret signal.

82
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Hypothetically, I'm in danger

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
and can't get away.

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,960
If I want you to run first,

85
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,640
I'll say I'll treat you to cilantro.

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
Okay, I'll be waiting for you.

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,720
I like cilantro too.

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
Has it occurred to you

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
your hint is exactly what I need,

90
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,000
so that she can stay there?

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Sadly,

92
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,200
when she's in most need
of your protection tonight,

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
you aren't there for her.

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,800
Ali, watch him.

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Miss Shen,

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,320
nothing is wrong with your uncle's
autopsy report.

97
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,640
He did die of a heart attack.

98
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
Gather all members
of the security department,

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
including those who are on duty by turns.

100
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,880
All armed and on high alert.

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
They must protect the company well.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Okay, got it.

103
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,220
(Autopsy Report)

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,320
So hard.

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
I wonder if your other parts
are so hard too.

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,720
We've known each other for long.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Release me now.

108
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm in a hurry.

109
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,360
Oh please, honey.

110
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,720
I got paid for this.

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,600
As long as you're alive,

112
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,040
I'm fine with whatever you want to do.

113
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
But now,

114
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,880
you must play with me.

115
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,480
What are you doing?

116
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
You must be wound up in the car.

117
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,000
What? Pissed off?

118
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
All security guards, attention!

119
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,240
This is Ma Liu.

120
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm in the underground parking...

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
There's another one.

122
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,080
Man.

123
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,760
You look

124
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,880
really sexy now.

125
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,320
Release me. I can be sexier.

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,720
Nice try.

127
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,080
This time, you can't get away.

128
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,440
Don't tell me
it's the alcohol I had last time.

129
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Do you think I'll fall into the same trap?

130
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,760
Rest assured. This is definitely different.

131
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,440
Okay, I'll trust you for once.

132
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
This time, it's stronger than the last one.

133
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,720
You can't get away anyway.

134
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,640
Just don't hold it back anymore.

135
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,520
I really wanna do it with you
for a bit longer.

136
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,880
But I'm really in a hurry.

137
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,440
I can't tear off the chains.

138
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,000
But I can tear off the chair.

139
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Awesome. Impressive.

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
But the dosage of the drug is a bit large.

141
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,760
The cure is on your lips, right?

142
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,680
Bingo.

143
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,760
Come on.

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
You wanna save Shen Xingyu.

145
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,440
Then you've got to kiss me
for the antidote.

146
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,000
The dosage of the drug is so large.

147
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
