Uncle Zhongtian.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,400
You are not

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,160
getting married today.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,720
I've decided to marry him.
He is Shen family's son-in-law.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,040
Xingyu,

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,000
not anyone

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,470
can become part of the Shen family.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,760
Kid.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,040
(Zhao Wudi & Shen Xingyu)
Your name was pasted at the last minute.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,240
You should understand

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,720
that you're just a substitute.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,440
I just know that I've liked Shen Xingyu
for a long time.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,400
- You don't even understand her.
- I do.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,440
She wakes up at exactly 6:50 AM every day.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,560
(Then, have a cappuccino without sugar.)

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,040
(She hates celery, loves tomatoes,)

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,880
(and is allergic to certain foods.)

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,560
(She likes cats,
but is allergic to cat fur.)

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
(She does Iyengar Yoga
before going to bed every night.)

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,960
(She loves novels written by Kafka.)

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
She hates the science of success.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,560
(Why does he know so much about me?)

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,160
Xingyu must have told you all that

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,960
at the last minute, right?

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
It doesn't mean anything.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,160
Now,

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
I believe I am qualified, right?

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,000
Look. Now that I look again,

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
you two make a perfect match.

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
Can you see it?

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
I don't think so.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,320
Who are you?
Why do you know so much about me?

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,200
What did you tell Uncle Zhongtian?

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
I have a secret crush on you
for a long time.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,240
What I told Uncle Zhongtian was

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,880
- his private bank account number.
- Nonsense.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,040
- How do you know all these?
- Take a guess.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,920
Bride and groom, please enter the hall.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,080

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,520
still getting married?

43
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,630

Have you arranged for the pickup?

50

It's guaranteed to be foolproof.

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
That's too deliberate.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,960

to seek attention.

56
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,760
Sure, keep watching then.

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,680
He should still be in the basement.

All the exits are blocked.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520

Not a lot. It's all encrypted.

I had no choice.

98

I was forced to do this, Xingyu.

99
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
Mr. Han, we cracked the encrypted file.

100
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,650
There are three mysterious investors
behind Xingyu Optoelectronics.

101

They have been helping Shen Xingyu

Mr. Han, the costs of the operation

111
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,400
have exceeded the value of
Xingyu Optoelectronics.

112
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
It will be worth it.

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
Things behind Xingyu
aren't as simple as imagined.

114
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,040
According to the company rules,

115
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
sleeping on duty
is punishable with a fine.

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,480
Well, I gotta sleep during the day

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,200
to stay alert during the night.

118
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,880
Work time is over.

119
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,600
Come home with me.

120
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,400
Our marriage is a sham.

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,720
No need to be this serious.

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
If we're doing this, we gotta do it right.

123
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,720
We gotta make it look real
because it is a sham.

124
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,040
I don't get it.

125
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,560
Why is a female billionaire CEO

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
living in an ordinary apartment?

127
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,840
You must be familiar with my house.

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,160
You must have been in here, or peeped at me.

129
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Don't be harsh.

130
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,040
I live in the opposite.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
I occasionally see you. That's all.

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
Since we're in a working partnership,

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
I make something clear beforehand.

134
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,800
Firstly, we will not interfere

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
in each other's love life.

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,940
Secondly, Uncle Shen
will definitely send someone to spy on me.

137
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,280
You must act along with me.

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,720
Act as a loving couple?

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,440
Thirdly,

140
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
no one is allowed to enter my bedroom.

141
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,320
- Except me?
- Including you.

142
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,600
What's the point in acting?

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,880
Then, I'll add a rule too.

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,840
This sofa is mine now.

145
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,120
No one else can sit.

146
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,520
Why are you staring at me?
That includes you.

147
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,520
This is my home.

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
This sofa is my home now.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,710
