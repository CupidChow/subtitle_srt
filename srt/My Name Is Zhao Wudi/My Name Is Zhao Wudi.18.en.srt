1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,960
I doubt you asked me here

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,040
just to have tea.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,680
I'll be straightforward.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
The Shen Group wants Wushuang.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,200
Is that why you hired outsiders

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,360
to break into Xingyu Optoelectronics
to steal Wushuang?

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,280
As the chairman of this group,

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,680
why would I resort to this dirty tactic?

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,520
I asked you here

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,840
to purchase the patent for Wushuang

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,000
from Xingyu Optoelectronics.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,520
Then, the group will invest
money into its research.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,240
This will ensure the confidence
of the shareholders.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm sorry, Uncle Zhongtian.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,720
Our research into
the application of Wushuang

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,840
has reached 70%.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,160
Research and development is difficult,

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
especially at the final stage.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,480
We can collaborate

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,000
and conduct the research using all
the resources available to the group.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
Xingyu Optoelectronics will enjoy
a permanent profit of 50%.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,240
What do you think?

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
Come in.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,960
Dr. Zhou, this is the report
from yesterday's experiment.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,840
What about the result
from the control group?

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,280
It's not done yet.

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,920
Get it done.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Okay, I'll do it right away.

(Top Secret Information; Wushuang)

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,040
Xingyu,

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
have you considered it?

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
This is not negotiable.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,340
Wushuang is an inheritance
left to me by my brother

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,360
and also the core technology
of Xingyu Optoelectronics.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
It must be developed independently by us.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
Research and development is difficult.

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,440
It needs a huge sum of money.

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,480
This isn't something
Xingyu Optoelectronics can afford.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Money isn't the problem.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,360
I will find a way to solve it.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,720
Shen Xingyu,

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
are you determined

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
to break away from the group?

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
This is the era where technology rules.

47
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
The group may be huge

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,600
with a lot of businesses

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,720
but it doesn't have
its own core technology.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,040
You rely on Xingyu Optoelectronics

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,320
to maintain your reputation.

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
Losing Xingyu Optoelectronics

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,000
will be a loss to the group.

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,080
Zhao Wudi,

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,960
you're just the head of security,

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,200
and the son-in-law of the Shen family.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
This is no place for you to speak.

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
He merely said what I wanted to say.

59
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,520
Dr. Zhou has obtained information
on Wushuang.

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,720
Take out 500 million

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,600
and rebuild the laboratory
as Dr. Zhou demanded.

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Get Dr. Zhou to conduct research here
as soon as possible.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
We must get a result

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,920
before Shen Xingyu does.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,040
I'll leave them with no escape.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,080
Miss Shen, the information on the company's
core technology got stolen.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
Where is Dr. Zhou?

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
We lost contact.

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,520
Find him now.

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,040
No need.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,560
Dr. Zhou has gone to the group.

73
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
It looks like

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
they want to reconstruct Wushuang.

75
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,580
(Xingyu Optoelectronics Corporation)

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,640
Miss Shen, the group has conducted
its first experiment.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,520
They're moving really fast.

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
They spent a lot of money on it.

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
The first two stages have gone smoothly.

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
If the third stage is successful,

81
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,400
they would really have developed Wushuang.

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,480
The show is getting interesting.

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,840
We spent hundreds of million

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,760
and this is what we got?

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,480
All the shareholders of the group

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,640
are doubting my leadership.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
Dr. Zhou,

88
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,680
can you explain this to me?

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,800
Mr. Shen,

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
we've been carrying out the development

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
using information on Wushuang.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,840
I checked it multiple times.

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,880
There is absolutely no problem.

94
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
Besides, I've reported

95
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,880
every step to you.

96
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
The first two stages went very smoothly,

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,200
but when we got into the third stage,

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,040
it suddenly exploded.

99
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Unless...

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,600
What is it?

101
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,200
Unless this information we obtained

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,320
was tampered with.

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,280
Nonsense.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,800
This information was verified
by all the scientists in the group.

105
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,360
How can it be fake?

106
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
It's Shen Xingyu.

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,120
We got played.

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
By Miss Shen?

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
It exploded.

110
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,440
I'm glad this explosion
didn't happen in our company.

111
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,320
Otherwise, the money we put into research
would go down the drain.

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,920
Wudi, why are you smiling?

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Our beloved uncle fell into the trap.

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,400
Trap? What does that mean?

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
I already predicted Uncle Zhongtian
would approach the research team.

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,440
So, I've made some preparations.

117
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,280
Xingyu, it's just as you predicted.

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Shen Zhongtian has started to recruit me.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,960
Uncle Zhongtian has already
started making his move.

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,160
Zhou, this information on Wushuang

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,760
has false information mixed in.

122
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,840
Other than the core team,

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,920
no one can tell it apart.

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
By then, you'll bring this to them.

125
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,840
I'm just a researcher.

126
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
Acting is a hobby.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
What if they found out?

128
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,040
It'll be fine.

129
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,920
Just act.

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,600
Give this to them.

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm sorry to trouble you.

133
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,960
This is no trouble.

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
Your father was my mentor

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
and you discovered my talent.

136
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
If you hadn't looked for me,

137
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
I would have given up.

138
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,440
Leave this to me.

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
Miss Shen, you're awesome.

140
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
You're always prepared.

141
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
I also came up with the idea.

142
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,160
Are you trying to take the credit?

143
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
No, this is all Miss Shen's effort.

144
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,080
Ma Ling,

145
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,070
tell your brother to bring a team
to Dr. Zhou's house right away

146
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,080
and relocate his family.

147
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
Now that the mission is a success,

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,040
Dr. Zhou's identity may get exposed.

149
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,880
It isn't safe.

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,280
Got it. I'll do it right away.

151
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Aren't you going with her?

152
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Of course not.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
I need to protect my wife.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,920
What are you doing?

155
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,910
- Dr. Zhou's daughter is inside the van.
- Yes.

156
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,320
Hurry, call Wudi.

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:44,800
Okay.

158
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Don't get out of the car
if anything happens.

159
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,200
