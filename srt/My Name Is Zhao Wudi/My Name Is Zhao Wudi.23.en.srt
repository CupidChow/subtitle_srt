1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,960
Miss Shen,

2
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,520
don't stare at me like that.

3
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm timid.

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,200
The last person who looked at me like this

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,360
still has his eyes

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,560
sit in a jar of formalin in my bedroom.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,440
If you don't calm down,

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,920
things can only go terribly wrong.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,920
Who are you?

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,600
Allow me to introduce myself.

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,200
I, Bald Eagle,

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,440
and Shen Xingchen

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
came from the same base.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm truly sorry for Shen Xingchen's death.

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
The one who should die

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
was Zhao Wudi.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,240
So, it's true.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,640
Looks like you know more than I thought.

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
When you kidnapped me so publicly,

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
people will notice very quickly.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
So what if they do?

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
Other than Zhao Wudi,

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
no one cares if you live or die.

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
Or were you counting

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,080
on this?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
This is for you.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,720
It's ugly.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,520
From which dollar store did you buy this?

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,080
Don't you get it?

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,360
There's a tracking chip inside.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,750
It's well hidden.

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
It's about time.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
He should be here soon.

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,540
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 23=

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll take care of the ones outside.

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,160
Saving your woman
is gonna cost you at least ten million.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,880
I don't have ten million.

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,760
I'll owe you a favor.

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,880
Deal.

40
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,020
(No Smoking)

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,080
Zhao Wudi, go.

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
They lured you here on purpose.

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
Zhao Wudi,

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
we meet again.

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,560
Don't call me Zhao Wudi.

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm Cang Ming.

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,440
The one who ranks first
on the Gray Zone, Cang Ming.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,000
You hid so well.

50
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,760
What do you want?

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Let her go. I'll give you anything.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,640
Is she

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
so important to you?

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,240
Bald Eagle.

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,360
Is she worth it?

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,760
This is the first time

57
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,800
I'm meeting you as Bald Eagle.

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,960
I have a huge gift for you.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,920
Zhao Wudi,

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
we meet again.

61
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,960
Wudi.

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Zhao Wudi.

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Why did you kill Captain Shen?

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,640
This must be your scheme again.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,280
Although I haven't found out

66
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,960
what happened that day,

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,360
the scheme on that day
smells like your doing.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
You should have proof
before slandering me.

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,280
I have proof that you killed Captain Shen.

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,640
But you

71
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,440
can only slander me.

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
That year, you instructed Mr. Hu

73
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,720
to use 2 million to hunt me
and Xingchen down.

74
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,440
Why did you do it?

75
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,800
That's just your word.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,240
When Captain Shen died,

77
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
only you were by his side.

78
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
You are the most suspicious.

79
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,960
Hanbao,

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,480
we worked together for so long.

81
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,680
You know my character.

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
I hope you can see

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Bald Eagle's true colors.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,280
Zhao Wudi,

85
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
you didn't really think

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160
that I want to avenge Shen Xingchen,
did you?

87
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,520
Zhao Wudi,

88
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,200
people would die for wealth
as birds would die for food.

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
Wudi,

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
don't worry about me.

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,360
Just go.

92
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,520
Just go.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,080
A crisis really does reveal true feelings.

94
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,280
Zhao Wudi,

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,360
you should thank me.

96
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
I should thank you.

97
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,400
Now, I don't need to show any mercy.

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,970
You were always be number one
in training camp

99
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,560
but don't underestimate me.

100
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,280
Wudi.

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
What do you think, Zhao Wudi?

102
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Are you happy

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,840
