1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,560
Honey, let me hold the bag for you.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,080
Miss is an old acquaintance.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,520
She insisted on making me her master.
It's true.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,460
Her father is a well-known
international tycoon.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,520
He wants me to protect her.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,000
He even wants me
to marry into her family.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,280
I don't believe you.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,000
Why would I lie to you?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,390
At that time, the shares document
and a 10 billion dollar property document

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,120
were placed in front of me.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,720
I only need to sign
and Aibora Manor would've been mine.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,700
Why don't you say you'll become
the king of the oil country?

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,360
Keep it down.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,850
How do you know about that?

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,120
Miss Shen, please wait.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,160
Miss and Mr. Zhao are old acquaintances,

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,440
so she specifically told me

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,360
to strongly support Miss Shen.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,360
I've decided to invest 100 million
in the Greater China region.

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
This is the contract.
You may sign it right away.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,560
She did it on her own.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm innocent.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,840
Congratulations on the
successful contract, honey.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,360
To celebrate this success,

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,320
let's go drinking.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,960
Go drinking?

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
Do you wanna have
a great time drinking with me

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,840
and then...

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,480
You're overthinking it.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Okay, I'll go.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,320
How can I not celebrate
my wife's success?

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,800
Let's go.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
What's the progress with the server?

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,320
Mr. Han, we've cracked 20% of it.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Tell them to hurry up.

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Xingyu,

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,680
don't blame my appetite

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,800
after I swallowed your company.

39
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,580
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 8=

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
Please enjoy.

41
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,600
Thank you.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,320
Shady?

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,320
Pink beauty?

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
Get drunk or else?

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,240
Honey, are you hinting me?

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,120
What else?

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,080
You have a nightclub girl on your left,

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
and the daughter of
the Qatar Group on your right.

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,240
So many people are interested in you.
I really can't sleep well.

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,800
Let me sleep in your bed tonight

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,560
and I guarantee a good night's sleep.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
I wasn't joking with you.

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,200
Don't be so kinky during the day.

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,160
Come here.

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,400
Let me ask you.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,080
Am I pretty

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,920
or is the daughter
of the Qatar Group prettier?

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,760
Xingchen.

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
What are you doing here?

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
I've been looking for you.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,780
Wudi, do you regret joining this profession?

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,600
I am

63
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
a single man

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
with no one to care about.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
What's there to regret?

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,580
What about you, Xingchen?

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,200
I feel like I let my sister down.

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
She is always scared for me.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,760
Don't think too much.

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,200
In my heart,

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
you're like this.

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm like this.

73
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
So, tell me.

74
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,880
Which one are you?

75
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm like this, too.

76
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,920
It's so rare to spend a day in peace.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Ours is a contract marriage.

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
You're gonna cross the line.

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,720
Fine. I'll ask you a question
that doesn't cross the line.

80
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
How do you know my brother?

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,920
Your brother did me a favor.

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
So, I owe him one.

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,080
Then, do you also know
that my brother died?

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,830
I'm not sure about the details.

85
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,720
Anyway, it's not like what they say.

86
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,400
They? Who are they?

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
I only heard others chatting about it.
I forgot.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,220
- Hello.
- Miss Shen, the firewall is down.

89
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,520
There are no traces of any intrusion.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,080
What?

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,320
Okay, I got it. I'm coming back.

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,000
What happened?

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,290
Ma Ling said important files
in the company got leaked.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,720
The server's firewall
should have been encrypted.

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,840
How could it leak?

96
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,760
There were no traces of an intrusion.

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,240
The server room.

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,400
Miss Shen.

99
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,440
What happened?

100
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,440
I don't know
how the other party got connected.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,640
Without your permission,

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,960
we couldn't shut it down.

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
Fingerprint unlocked.

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
Enabling iris scan.

105
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,380
(Iris Scan Approved)

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
I've authorized it.

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,960
Why is the data still being transferred?

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,080
I don't know.

109
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Call the police.

110
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,460
(23% Transmission Aborted)

111
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,480
I found this behind the server.

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,840
A wireless signal transmitter?

113
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,320
Lan Lan must have left this behind

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
when she stole the files.

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
But the files in here

116
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
require my fingerprint and iris to unlock.

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
It's easy to get your fingerprint.

118
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,680
As for your iris...

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,840
Was there any instrument
that might have scanned your eyes lately?

120
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
Hello, please cooperate.

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
That Han guy went through so much

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
just to get your iris information

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
and steal the files.

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,800
This place

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,160
doesn't look safe anymore.

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,220
(23% Transmission Aborted)

127
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,960
Mr. Han,

128
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,960
I think they found the transmitter.

129
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,290
The transmission is terminated.

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,560
We only received about 23% of the data.

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,080
- What about shareholder information?
- Only found one.

132
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
In the high-end parts
manufacturing industry.

133
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,320
About 45 years old.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,850
(Suspicious Website Alert)

135
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,920
The Gray Zone?

136
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
Isn't this the rumored kill list?

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Kill list?

138
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
Let's help Zhao Wudi get on this list.

139
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,460
(One Car Per Entry,
Please Slow Down)

140
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,880
Wudi.

141
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,960
What happened?

142
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,640
Is this you?

143
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,800
You got it wrong.

144
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm dumb, not blind.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,960
This is you.

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,600
The bounty is 100,000 dollars.

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,800
Wudi, you're really valuable.

148
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,760
What now?

149
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,880
Do you wanna kill me and take the bounty?

150
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,080
What?

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,160
How did you get onto the Gray Zone?

152
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,400
All the bad guys are on this list.

153
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,840
- You're just a security guard.
- What about a security guard?

154
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Be honest and tell me what you used to do.

155
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
Do you have any sort of connections

156
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,260
- and get me on the list too?
- Stop reading web novels.

157
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,120
Why would you trust
a bounty on a dumb website?

158
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,440
Why do you wanna get on the list?
Why not get to Heaven?

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,900
Wudi, do me this favor
and I'll get to brag for a lifetime.

160
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,040
Wudi, you must have
a lot of stories to tell.

161
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
I have wine. I'll treat you.

162
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,080
Hi, we meet again.

163
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
Don't worry. There is no one else here.

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,160
I don't want anyone to disturb our date.

165
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
You're quite special

166
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,360
for choosing this dating spot.

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,240
A man who is on the Gray Zone

168
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,040
willingly works as a security guard.

169
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,000
I think you are the special one.

170
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,760
So,

171
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,640
do you also want 100,000 dollars?

172
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,760
I might wanna warn you

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
that I happen to have the same name.

174
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
That's a better news.

175
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,120
I wouldn't have the heart to kill you.

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,800
I just want your...

177
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,600
You're still so ruthless.

178
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
I really like it.

179
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,680
Unfortunately,

180
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,400
I don't like the way you smile.

181
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,800
What's this? I stabbed you once

182
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,080
and you wanna stab me back?

183
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,760
Can't do it?

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,680
You can do it without a knife.
