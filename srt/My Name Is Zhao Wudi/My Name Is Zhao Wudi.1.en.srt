(Bridegroom Li Xian & Bride Shen Xingyu
We're getting married!)

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,360
You fell asleep on the watch.
I've got nothing to say.

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,360
Is the wedding over?

10
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Are you still in your dream?

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
It hasn't even begun.

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,240
No one is here yet.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,440
The female billionaire CEO
of Xingyu Optoelectronics

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
is beautiful and rich.

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Even her wedding isn't made public.

16
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,750
The absence of wedding photos aside,
I haven't even seen the groom.

17
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,440
Is this how rich people do things?

18
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't poke your nose into others' business.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,960
Napping would be a better use
of that effort.

20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
Enough, don't fall asleep.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,320
Buck up.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,440
You'd never know

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,200
if they might just give us a bonus, right?

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,400
They're here.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Miss Shen is here. Hurry.

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,620
(Xingyu Optoelectronics CEO, Shen Xingyu
Shen Xingchen's Younger Sister)

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Congratulations to Miss Shen
on your marriage.

28
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
Xingyu, Li Xian refuses to get married.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,160
Then, tell him to leave.

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,120
I won't play his game anymore.

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
What about the wedding?

32
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,480
I must get married today.

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
Shen Xingyu must get married today.

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,320
Otherwise, the Shen family
will take Xingyu Optoelectronics back.

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,800
(CEO of Han Group, Han Renxin)
What Shen Xingyu isn't aware of

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
is that the groom is my man.

37
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
The wedding must go on.

38
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,590
(Wedding)

39
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,200
What's your name?

40
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,720
- Zhao Wudi.
- Are you married?

41
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,680
No.

42
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
Excellent. Follow me.

43
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,360
Okay.

44
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
He will be the groom.

45
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,560
What?

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,400
Aren't you single? Marry me.

47
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,360
No way. We have no affection at all.

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
I am Shen Xingyu.

49
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,040
With this looks and figure,

50
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,080
what aren't you satisfied with?

51
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
I have my principles too.

52
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,530
(We're getting married!)

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
Fine, just get out.

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,400
Lan Lan, what is wrong with me?

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,520
Why won't anyone marry me?

56
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,560
Go and find one.

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,840
We need to get through today.

58
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay.

59
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
(Xingchen, what should I do?)

60
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,230
What did Miss Shen
ask you to go inside for?

61
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,240
She proposed to me. I said no.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Do I look dumb?

63
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,380
Yes.

64
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,080
I wouldn't believe you even if I'm dumb.
You're just a security guard.

65
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,760
Coward.

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,200
Stay guard here. I'll go check it out.

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,920
Wudi, if Miss Shen isn't picky,

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,480
you could recommend me.

69
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,360
Xingyu, I got you a driver.

70
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,820
I grabbed him at the entrance just now.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
Have you explained it to him?

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes, I gave him 20,000 yuan

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
to go through with the formalities.

74
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
- I told him to change his clothes.
- Good.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,920
But, will Uncle Shen

76
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,400
accept something like this?

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,440
Uncle Shen will not come.

78
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,200
This wedding is just a formality,
and everyone knows it.

79
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,760
But they've met Li Xian.

80
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,920
So what?

81
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,440
Who would wanna embarrass the Shen family?

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,720
Besides, they look forward
to my fake marriage.

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,040
When the time calls for it,
I'll have to marry for convenience again.

84
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,640
Xingyu.

85
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
Han Renxin?

86
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
Xingyu, I told you.

87
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,880
Li Xian isn't a good man.

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,920
I am the one for you.

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,160
I told you before, too.

90
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,640
It's impossible between us.

91
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,960
Xingyu, can't you give me a chance?

92
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,920
Give you a chance to kick others
when they're down?

93
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,160
Xingyu, you misunderstood me.

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
Marrying me is your best choice.

95
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,120
Not only
can you save Xingyu Optoelectronics,

96
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
I can even invest...

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm afraid Xingyu Optoelectronics
will belong to the Han family by then.

98
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm here to help you.

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,040
Do you have another choice?

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,720
I won't bother you, Mr. Han.

101
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,080
I already have another choice.

102
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,040
That taxi driver?

103
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
Too bad, he's my man.

104
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
I think he should be home by now.

105
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,120
The ceremony will begin in 10 minutes.

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,160
Shen Xingyu,
you don't have another choice.

107
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,680
Then, I won't get married.

108
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,000
We're burning the bridges today.

109
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
Shen Xingyu.

110
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,680
I'm standing here because the Shen family
tacitly agreed to this.

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Many people wish us
to walk out of here together.

112
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,160
If you aren't coming with me today,

113
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,600
then you aren't going anywhere.

114
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,160
Do you really wanna burn the bridges?

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,920
Are you willing to give up

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,440
Xingyu Optoelectronics?

117
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,320
Stop waiting. There are no miracles.

118
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
My apologies, I'm late.

119
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,760
You even got me a best man.

120
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't think you can just show up

121
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
like a hero to rescue
the damsel in distress.

122
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,160
No one can ever take anyone away from me.

123
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,160
I guess I'll be breaking that record.

124
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,320
I've kept you waiting, my beautiful bride.
