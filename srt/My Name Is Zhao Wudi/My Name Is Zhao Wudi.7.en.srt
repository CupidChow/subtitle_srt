1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,760
How useless.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,240
I gave you so much information,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,680
and you can't catch up to Shen Xingyu.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm doing it for my future plans.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,200
What other plans do you have?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,280
I got

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,600
Shen Xingyu's fingerprint and iris.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,920
The data is in here.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,600
Xingyu Optoelectronics' server
will no longer have any secrets.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,400
You're hurting me.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,560
The antidote was on her lips.

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,800
Zhao Wudi,

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,480
do you know what you're doing?

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,240
Take a shower.

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,520
Zhao Wudi,

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,360
I haven't complained about you
smelling like a drunkard.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,640
And you wanna be picky with me?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,960
I don't get it.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,760
Why don't I deserve you?

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,120
Give this to my sister.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,060
Protect her. Protect Wushuang.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Yeah.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,400
You don't.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Zhao Wudi?

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,360
Zhao Wudi, wake up.

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,920
Zhao Wudi, wake up.

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,680
Explain this to me.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,640
Zhao Wudi.

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,760
You worked hard.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
- Yu?
- Xingchen.

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
What's wrong?

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,040
Nothing.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
You got hurt again?

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm a man. Of course, I'd have injuries.

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Does it hurt?

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,000
No.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
Are you really okay?

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm okay. Let's go home. Come.

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,440
Are you sure
you don't wanna go to the hospital?

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,160
No need.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,760
(Zhao Wudi, who are you?)

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,580
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 7=

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,400
He's still asleep.

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,760
Wake up.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Wake up. Wake up.

46
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,680
Wake up.

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Honey, did you do that to me last night?

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
No wonder my waist and back feels sore.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,840
How shameless.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,920
Are you a man?

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Am I a man or not?

52
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Shouldn't you know that best?

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,360
Forget it. I won't argue with you anymore.

54
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,560
There is a business dinner tonight.

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,240
I have to win over Qatar Group
as my client.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,360
Why are you suddenly
interested in Qatar Group?

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,760
After Mr. Jiang's identity got exposed,

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,960
the identities of the other
two shareholders are no longer safe.

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,900
Plus, Han Renxin is actively
trying to seize Xingyu Optoelectronics.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
That's why I need to be extra prepared.

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,560
What do you need me to do?

62
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,400
Be a decent man.

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
Look at the way you are dressed.

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,320
How are you joining me for dinner?

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll go get it.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,880
Ma Ling is here.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
Don't stand there. Come in.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,960
Miss Shen, I didn't see a thing.

70
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,520
It's not her fault.

71
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,080
The fault is all mine.

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
Zhao Wudi, shut up.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,480
Come in.

74
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,280
How is it going?

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,060
We've decrypted 10%
of Xingyu Optoelectronics' files.

76
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,400
What do you think?

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
Aren't I handsome today?

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
Back to business.
Who are we meeting today?

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,280
Mr. Li of the Qatar Group
in the Greater China region.

80
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,640
I must win him over tonight.

81
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,120
You passed.

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,280
Sir, please proceed
with the facial recognition.

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,480
It didn't scan me?

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,960
Scanning failed.

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,120
Maybe it's because I smiled.
Let me try again.

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,880
Scanning failed.

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Honey.

88
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
Aren't you very capable?

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,000
Find a way to get in.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Only business owners

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,840
who are invited
may participate in this dinner.

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't I look like a boss?

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,240
I have memorized your face.

94
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,720
Very professional.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,760
To be honest, we're colleagues.

96
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,920
No point in disrupting
each other's jobs, right?

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
Sir, please leave.

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
Don't keep me from my work.

99
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
Outstanding.

100
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,040
Mr. Li.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,040
Miss Shen.

102
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,920
This is the cooperation plan
by Xingyu Optoelectronics.

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,500
We've tailored this plan
based on the needs of Qatar Group.

104
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
Please take a look.

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,920
This plan is very good.

106
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,240
But it's unfortunate.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,040
I have already received

108
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
a very similar plan.

109
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,840
I never expected
our company's draft to be leaked.

110
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,000
However, I have another

111
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
more detailed and comprehensive
execution plan.

112
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,440
Please take a look.

113
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,360
This plan is excellent.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
This is the type of superb client
we like to work with.

115
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,820
However, your company's qualifications
and experience seem a bit lacking.

116
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,640
I won't guarantee a win,

117
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,680
but I will recommend it.

118
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,440
- I look forward to hearing from you.
- Okay.

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
Take your time.

120
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
It's always a pleasure
to work with the smart ones.

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,280
Allowing Han Group
to invest in Xingyu Optoelectronics

122
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,120
to enhance its qualification

123
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,760
would actually be a good decision.

124
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,200
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Han.
I don't need it.

125
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
My beloved wife,

126
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,760
I got in.

127
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,200
Aren't I amazing?

128
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
Be serious.

129
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,550
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,150
This is no place for you.

131
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,760
Do you want to leave on your own

132
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,320
or shall I get the security
to escort you out?

133
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,080
You're not in charge here.

134
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,680
I obey my wife.

135
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,800
If she tells me to leave, I'll leave.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Master, it's me.

137
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,120
Miss!

138
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,240
I missed you so much.

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,400
Don't you miss me?

140
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,460
I missed you so much,

141
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,920
I changed my name to Nianxi.
[*Nianxi: missing the past]

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
What I miss is our past.

143
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Don't say such nonsense.

144
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,360
My wife is watching.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,320
Your dad paid me a lot of money back then.

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,560
I was just doing what I got paid for.

147
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,120
She's leaving.

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,800
Stand there.

149
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,080
Master, you...

150
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,600
