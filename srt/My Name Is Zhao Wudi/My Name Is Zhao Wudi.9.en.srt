1
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,840
Retreat.

2
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,400
I got hurt because of you.

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Shouldn't you tell me about the Gray Zone?

4
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,920
So, you wanna get on the list?

5
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,720
I knew you had connections.

6
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,080
Tell me.

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,000
Help me up.

8
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,380
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 9=

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,080
Wudi, do you think my hand needs stitches?

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,080
I don't think I can move it.

11
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Your case needs an amputation.

12
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
Amputation?

13
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,040
That knife isn't poisoned, right?

14
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,880
Wudi, do I have to...

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
Just put a band-aid on it.

16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,400
You'll be fine.

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,400
Wudi, what did you use to do?

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
You have assassins on your tail.

19
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
You can't deny the Gray Zone
this time, can you?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,720
I can't believe I could meet someone

21
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
on the Gray Zone in my lifetime,

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
and a living one at that.

23
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,960
Oh, yes, Wudi.
You'd better give me an autograph later.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,960
Otherwise, it'd be too late
after you died.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,840
Thanks, man. You're really thinking ahead.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaking of that,

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
you are someone

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,480
on the Gray Zone, right?

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,720
You aren't working as a security guard here

30
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
for a reason, right?

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,360
Is it a top secret mission?

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,400
Or someone is out for revenge?

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,720
Someone put a bounty on my head

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,560
to get others to kill me

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,560
but he doesn't know me well enough.

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,320
That's why he put me on the Gray Zone.

37
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
This person thinks quite highly of me.

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,720
He offered 100,000 dollars straightaway.

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,680
Why are you laughing?

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,720
100,000 is a lot of money.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,720
People will definitely die
trying to get it.

42
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,120
It's just 100,000.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
Why die trying?

44
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,960
They're trash anyway.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,640
Ma Liu, even you can do it.

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Am I right?

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
You can tell?

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,720
Everyone has their own stories, right?

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,200
Liu, Wudi.

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,240
I brought you something...

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Ma Ling.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,880
Liu, what happened to your hand?

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
- Ling.
- What happened?

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,960
I have a terrible news.

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Your brother's hand

56
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,520
needs to be amputated.

57
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,760
Amputated? You were fine during the day.

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
Why do you need amputation now?

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,800
No, Ling.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Don't you care about me?

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
You're the pillar of strength
for our family.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,510
No, he...

63
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm fine. Look.

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,800
It's just a cut.

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,840
Don't listen to Wudi's nonsense.

66
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,600
Does it hurt?
Do you wanna go to the hospital?

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,320
No need.

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
I'll bandage it for you.

69
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,120
No need.
It'll heal faster without bandages.

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Ling, you should have seen

71
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,600
how awesome your brother
fought off three people

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
just now.

73
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,280
Three gangsters came
to pick a fight with Wudi.

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
I jumped out there
without a second thought.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
If it weren't for me,

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,080
the one who needs an amputation
is you, Zhao Wudi.

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,160
That's great. Wudi,

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,920
you need to be careful at work
from now on.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
Don't go off on your own.

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,920
If you really have to,
take my brother along.

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
He can take a beating.

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,040
Why aren't you on your family's side?

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
You only got a cut
fighting off three people,

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,840
then you'd only break a finger
fighting off 30 people.

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,280
What kind of logic is that?

86
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
What do you mean by breaking a finger?

87
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,320
Enough.

88
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
Can't you handle such a minor injury?

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:13,920
Enough.

90
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,300
Ling, why is Miss Shen
still working overtime?

91
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,120
We have support
from that Qatar client, right?

92
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,720
So, our company got stronger

93
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,720
and rejected the acquisition
by other groups.

94
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Looks like someone is gonna be upset.

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
Shen Xingyu

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,040
refused the acquisition

97
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,960
for so little profits.

98
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,000
She has confidence now
because she has the money.

99
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,280
Now she doesn't even respect us,
her elders.

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,000
Xingyu Optoelectronics
will be ruined by her

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,040
if this goes on.

102
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,160
No, we must take it back
as soon as possible.

103
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
Right now,

104
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,680
the root of all our problems is Zhao Wudi.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
What kind of dumb luck

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,560
does this Zhao Wudi have?

107
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,840
He saved the daughter of the Qatar Group.

108
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,960
If we wanna separate Qatar Group
from Xingyu Optoelectronics,

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,000
we'll have to begin with Qatar Group.

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,080
It's best

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,120
to not spill blood.

112
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
We'll drive a wedge between them.

113
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,800
I only wish to bring Xingyu Optoeletronics
back into the family,

114
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,160
I do not wish harm on anyone.

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
Don't worry. I know what to do.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
Why should Li Xian
join Xingyu Optoelectronics?

117
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,800
I demand an explanation.

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
If you want Zhao Wudi to accept you,

119
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,080
you must first separate him
and Shen Xingyu.

120
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,080
Be a homewrecker?

121
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,320
No way.

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,640
You don't know this.

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,880
Li Xian is Shen Xingyu's
childhood sweetheart and boyfriend.

124
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,960
They were already planning
to get married

125
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,960
but they broke up

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,040
due to a bad argument.

127
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,640
Shen Xingyu married Zhao Wudi
out of anger.

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
It's okay to feel angry

129
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,280
but it's your master's happiness
that gets held up.

130
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
Master got made used of.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
Then, I need to save him.

132
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,280
Welcome to Xingyu Optoelectronics, Miss.

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,360
Welcome, Miss.

134
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,840
It is quite pretty

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
but this place is a bit small.

136
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,000
When my projects makes money,

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,680
I'll double my investment.

138
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,400
Miss, we appreciate your kind offer.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Why don't we get down to business?

140
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Sure.

141
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,660
This is detailed execution plan
for our current cooperation.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
Let's move on to the conference room
to watch the report on the roadshow.

143
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,800
Just contact

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
my special liaison
for something minor like this.

145
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
Special liaison?

146
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
(Electronics And Technology
Cooperation Plan)

147
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,840
Xingyu, we meet again.

148
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,280
It's you.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
Li Xian is fully authorized
to act as my agent

150
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,200
for all matters in China.

151
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,400
My business got delayed again.

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,960
Where is my master?

153
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,910
Give me a tour
of the security department.

154
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,280
The project plan is done.

155
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll ask her to sign this.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,480
Xingyu.

157
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,680
The success of this project

158
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
depends entirely on Miss' mood.

159
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Besides, she is about to go back
to her country.

160
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,720
You don't want anything to go wrong

161
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,760
at this point, do you?

162
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
Xingyu, I know.

163
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
I was wrong

164
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,440
but I really want to make it up to you.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,000
Since I'm the liaison for Qatar,

166
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,000
just let me know
if you have any demands.

167
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,160
I hope you can leave quickly.

168
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,560
This is a present from the Miss.

169
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
I don't need it.

170
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
Don't embarrass her.

171
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,440
Just try a bite.

172
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,880
You're prone to hypoglycemia.

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
You can replenish anytime.

174
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
(What is he up to now?)

175
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
(Doesn't he know
that I'm allergic to egg?)

176
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,800
(Forget it. For the sake of
a project worth 80 million,)

177
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,160
(I need try my luck.)

178
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,720
(Zhao Wudi, you must rescue me in time.)

179
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,160
Xingyu?

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,560
What's wrong?

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,640
Come on. Let's go to the hospital.

182
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,840
Hold on.

183
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,140
