1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,160
Do you even know how to drive?

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,840
Is this your parking space?

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,160
Get down.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,080
I'm talking to you. Get down.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,680
Fatty.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,840
Why did you come prepared?

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,720
Go on, fight. Aren't you a fighter?

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,800
Fatty.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,760
Liu.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,400
Ling.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,120
Let her go.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,190
Ling.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,580
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 19=

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,000
You worked hard, Zhou.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,280
I raise you a toast

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,080
for the company.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,800
No, no.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,960
I should thank you, Miss Shen.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,680
This trick was impeccable.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,640
Don't worry, Zhou.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,200
I arranged for your family
to be relocated.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,440
You should take a good rest

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,360
and lie low.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,240
Uncle Zhongtian might
make trouble for you.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,840
Thank you, Miss Shen.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,440
Daddy, save me.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,960
Save me.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,880
Who are you?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
- Let my daughter go.
- Hello, Dr. Zhou.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
There's a price to pay
for being a traitor.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
Let my daughter go.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
You have half an hour

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,600
to hand in the real information
on Wushuang.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,640
Otherwise,

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,080
your daughter will die

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,920
in a mysterious accident tomorrow.

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't be scared, Momo.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,440
Daddy's here, Momo.

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,760
What do we do?

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,600
Don't panic.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,160
I'll think of something.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,040
(Zhao Wudi: Calm Dr. Zhou.)

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,800
(I'll go rescue Momo.)

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Don't worry, Zhou.

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,760
Momo will come home safely.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
Momo, Momo.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,880
It's Daddy, don't be scared.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,440
Dr. Zhou, you have 10 minutes left.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,600
Here, I got the information on Wushuang.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,880
That information is clearly fake.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,560
You're still playing games with me.

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
Then, you'll be penalized.

53
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,120
Dr. Zhou.

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Dr. Zhou, look.

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
Momo.

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
- Daddy, come take me home.
- Don't be scared. I'll come soon.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,450
It's fine.

58
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,440
- Wudi.
- Don't be scared.

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,520
What are you doing?

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,720
Let go.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,440
He's not your brother, I am.

62
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Without Wudi,
could we even get out of here?

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,080
- Thank him.
- You aren't as capable.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank him by maintaining your distance.

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,880
He is a married man.

66
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,960
- Let go.
- Liu.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,120
The kid is watching.

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Don't you have something to explain to me?

69
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,240
Explain what?

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,040
Ma Ling is Ma Liu's sister, right?

71
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,120
Yes.

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
Anyone else might think her brother

73
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
is Zhao Wudi.

74
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Are you jealous?

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
I was saving them.

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,160
Forget it.

77
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,640
We'll let bygones be bygones.

78
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,680
You actually look quite handsome
when you were saving them.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,960
This is the first time
you praised me, honey.

80
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
I need to record this.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
Say that again.

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
Is that the best you can do?

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,320
My brother and I

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,440
said goodbye over there.

85
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,520
That was the last time I saw my brother.

86
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Ever since then,

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,920
I would come here alone

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,960
whenever I feel down.

89
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,410
After my parents died in an accident
during their research into Wushuang,

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
it was Uncle Shen and my brother

91
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,760
who showed me the most kindness.

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,160
I understand that
as the head of the family,

93
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,960
Uncle Shen needs to put the family first.

94
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,080
Those people were in the wrong first,

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,560
but Uncle Shen died for it.

96
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
It'll be fine.

97
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,640
We will

98
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,520
avenge Uncle Shen.

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,040
We'll take our time settling this score.

100
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
None of them will get away.

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,520
What's the point in revenge?

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,560
My brother and Uncle Shen
will never come back.

103
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,800
You still have me.

104
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,280
I'll protect you.

105
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,600
Will you protect me for life?

106
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,240
I...

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,880
I don't know.

108
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,840
But I understand everything about you.

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
You were always there.

110
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,880
Before this,

111
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,960
I protected you
to fulfill my promise to Xingchen.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
From now on,

113
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
I want to protect you

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,080
using my own ways.

115
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,240
Why?

116
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Are you afraid you can't give me a future?

117
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
You're invincible

118
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,600
but you're a coward

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,640
