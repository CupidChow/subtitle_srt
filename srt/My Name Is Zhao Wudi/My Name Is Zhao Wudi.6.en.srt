1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,960
Who sent you?

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Who sent me isn't important.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,720
I obey the one who offers a higher pay.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,240
Fingerprint.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,160
- Lan Lan, I treated you well, right?
- Stop your nonsense.

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,040
Fingerprint recognition success.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,120
This server uses the most advanced
encryption mode.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,120
It requires simultaneous
fingerprint and iris scan to unlock.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,800
Don't think I'm not aware of this.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,640
Iris scanning enabled.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,380
We can finally hack
into Xingyu Optoelectronics' server.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
Scanning in progress.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,480
Scan failed. No iris detected.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,720
Miss Shen,
since you are unwilling to cooperate,

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,080
then you'll have to suffer.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,840
- Zhao Wudi?
- This toy isn't enough to tase me.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
But enough to tase you.

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,640
Are you okay?

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm fine.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Ma Ling is over there.
Call an ambulance quickly.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Don't worry. I already did.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,880
Useless.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
He's tough?

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
No matter how tough a man is,
he softens when a woman who tells him to.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
You mean that woman?

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,560
That woman works for no one but money.

27
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,300
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 6=

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,880
I know you contributed.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,000
This coffee is for you.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,080
Wudi, don't you think
that crazy Lan Lan has some skills?

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,680
Lan Lan is just
another chess piece Han has.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,360
There should be a bigger predator behind.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,240
They had better not release her from jail.

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
Don't let me see her

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,840
or I'll cut her into...

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,520
- Into pieces.
- Enough.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
At least, everyone is safe.

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,800
Don't worry.

39
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Ma Ling is considered lucky.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Xingyu has made her

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
a personal assistant.

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,960
Her salary doubled.

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,080
Wudi, really?

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,560
Good.

45
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,560
- Our sister, right?
- My sister.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Zhao Wudi.

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,960
Super bodyguard
of Black Bat International Security.

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,040
Four years of experience.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,320
Mission completion rate is 99.7%

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
Mysteriously resigned two years ago.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,440
What do you want?

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,120
8:00 PM, tonight.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
No. 223, Hong Kong Road.

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Who is it?

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,480
Don't ask anything unnecessary.

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,920
And before I get back,

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,160
don't let my wife leave the company.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Your wife can't leave
but you can have fun?

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,480
Is that appropriate?

60
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,020
(YY Club
Don't let business get in the way of fun)

61
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,140
(Women's Toilet)

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,820
You're strong.

63
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,320
I like it.

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,720
If you're here to kill me,

65
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
then you've failed your mission.

66
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,600
Not necessarily.

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm letting you live

68
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
because I don't kill women.

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,600
Since you're already here,

70
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,360
how about a drink?

71
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,240
- Not interested.
- For Shen Xingyu's sake,

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,320
you will drink with me.

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,160
No. 223, Hong Kong Road.
I think you should take a look.

74
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Miss Shen, going home?

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm going to find Zhao Wudi.

76
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Drive safe, Miss Shen.

77
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,600
Oh, no.

78
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,400
Hello, please cooperate.

79
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,240
Thank you.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,720
That's fine, right?

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Say it.

82
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,200
What do you want?

83
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
At first,

84
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,320
I wanted to kill you.

85
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,240
But now

86
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,080
I have another idea.

87
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Zhao Wudi.

88
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,280
Honey, why are you here?

89
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm here to pick you up.

90
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,760
That...

91
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,240
Nothing happened between us.

92
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,360
I know.

93
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
She doesn't deserve you.

94
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,960
