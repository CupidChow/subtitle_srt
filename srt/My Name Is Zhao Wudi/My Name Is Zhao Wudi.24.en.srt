00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,860
=My Name Is Zhao Wudi=
=Episode 24=

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,080
Wudi.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,320
Are you okay, Wudi?

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm okay.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,960
Ali,

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,640
why?

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,640
Why?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,520
Of course, it's because
I offered her a high price

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,920
and something she couldn't resist.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,080
Ali is a chess piece
I planted a long time ago.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,680
(After Mr. Han discovered your identity,)

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,480
(I came to work
as Shen Zhongtian's assistant.)

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,280
(On the surface,
he seemed to be in control,)

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,760
but everything was in the palm of my hand.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,920
Okay.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,560
Tell me where the fourth key is.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,120
I can make you suffer less.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,840
Who is the person behind you?

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,600
I was talking about the key.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,360
Since you won't give it up,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,760
then let's make her woman

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,080
suffer.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,360
Stop it.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,920
Ali, you're betraying me.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,400
Don't you want to leave the organization?

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
Helping the man I love
save the woman he loves

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,360
is such a troublesome job.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,120
Isn't this more troublesome?

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,280
Wudi.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
In this case,

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,560
I'll give you another surprise.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,000
Xingchen.

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
- Captain.
- Xingchen.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,320
You're still alive.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,160
Where have you been all these years?

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,160
Why didn't you come home to me?

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Xingchen.

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,280
It's me, Xingyu.

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,400
Kill Zhao Wudi first.

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,200
Xingchen?

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,880
Wudi.

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,000
No, Xingchen.

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Wait.

44
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
What did you do to my brother?

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,280
Technological innovation
can change this era

46
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,920
and the fate of mankind
will also be changed by technology.

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,280
Shen Xingchen is the perfect combination
of artificial intelligence

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,960
and brain-computer interfaces.

49
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,680
Xingchen.

50
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,320
Xingchen, wake up.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,270
Are you trying to wake him?

52
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,800
Don't dream about it.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,520
He is the first generation of
the Smart Soldier that I developed.

54
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,800
He only listens to me.

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
You have Wushuang

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,520
but only want to use it as a battery.

57
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,320
Why don't you give it to me

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
and let me change this world?

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Isn't that good?

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
Shen Xingchen,

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,000
kill him.

62
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
(Activate Smart Sequence)

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,000
Wudi.

64
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,000
Xingchen.

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
What's wrong?

66
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
It's me, Xingchen.

67
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,160
Yu.

68
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Shen Zhongtian,

69
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,640
you considered every possible outcome

70
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
but have you thought about a camera
hidden in Uncle Shen's walking stick?

71
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
You're a suspect in Uncle Shen's murder.

72
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,760
The police are waiting outside.

73
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,050
If I had known this would happen,

74
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,400
I would have supported Xingyu.

75
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,910
It's a pity that you can't

76
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,810
attend Xingyu's wedding.

77
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,670
Wedding?

78
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,920
This time

79
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,600
we're legally married.

80
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
This is a happy ending, right?

81
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,440
I don't need to sleep on the sofa again.

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,920
Isn't this ceremony

83
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,400
too simple?

84
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,160
I, Zhao Wudi,

85
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,520
am willing to take Shen Xingyu as my wife.

86
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,600
For richer, for poorer,

87
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,880
in sickness and in health,

88
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,960
I will always love Shen Xingyu

89
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,160
until my last breath.

90
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,840
Shen Xingyu,

91
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
will you marry me?

92
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,440
Marry him.

93
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
Marry him.

94
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,040
Marry him.

95
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,800
Marry him!

96
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,160
Then, I'll reluctantly agree.

97
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
He failed at the critical moment.

98
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,680
Seriously.

99
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,080
I can't get married again.

100
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,400
Zhao Wudi.

101
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,320
Don't worry.

102
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,880
We are definitely getting married today.

103
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,720
I love you.

104
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,760
Good.

105
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
Groom,

106
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,080
you may now kiss your bride.

107
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,680
- Kiss.
- Kiss.

108
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,280
Zhao Wudi,

109
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,400
what kind of wedding did you plan?

110
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm about to get seasick.

111
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,400
Zhao Wudi.

112
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,760
Threat level SSS.

113
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,600
Requesting the activation of super spy.

114
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,740
