(Chi Ming, Cang Ming

00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,220
(Defense Program
Chi Ming, Qing Ming, Cang Ming, Moon)

4
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
(Cang Ming! Cang Ming?)

5
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,120
When did you start investigating me?

6
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,480
Since my brother got killed.

7
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,960
So, you got close to me,

8
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,040
faked a marriage with me,

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,320
and even used your own body

10
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
to investigate

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,760
the truth behind your brother's death.

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,280
My brother and I grew up
dependent on each other.

13
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,920
I can't let him die without a reason.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,040
If you really believe

15
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,480
that I killed your brother,

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,200
then shoot.

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
Do you think I won't?

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
I handled guns as a teenager

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
and joined Black Bat at 21.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,880
How would a fake gun scare me?

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,360
Xingyu,

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,160
don't do anything dangerous again, okay?

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
Who are you to control me?

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Zhao Wudi

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
or Cang Ming?

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,120
You were best friends with my brother,

27
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,040

and the next one, is you.

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,280

Xingchen

47

(Mr. Hu)
Your manipulation tactic is spectacular.

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,920
Zhao Wudi is ranked first
on the Gray Zone as Cang Ming.

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,320
No matter how good I am,

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
I can't be certain
if I could deal with him.

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
You could take advantage of this
and settle everything.

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,360
I've prepared the balance payment.

61
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you want him dead or alive?

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,640
I don't care.

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
I can't show you mercy this time.

64
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,860
(Cang Ming?)

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,280
Wudi, what are you drawing?

66
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Going into art?

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,120
You're terrible at this.

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,400
You need more practice.

69
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Where are you going?

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,520
An old friend is here.

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
I'm going to say hello.

72
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,520
Same trick every time.

73
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,080
Can't you be creative?

74
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Party A offered me a huge sum.

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
If I don't get rid of you,

76
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
how do I collect my balance?

77
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,280
What you said last time
caused my wife to misunderstand us.

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,680
Next time,

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,280
let's not meet.

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,160
I really can't bear to give you up.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
You weren't my match the last time.

82
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,480
And here you are, again.

83
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,080
Where do you get your confidence?

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,080
Looks like your misunderstanding
has been cleared up.

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
My boss has a message for you.

86
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,160
Do you know how Shen Xingchen died?

87
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
Gorgeous?

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
So, you're the old friend Wudi mentioned.

89
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,880
Wudi's old friend is also my old friend.

90
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
Add me on WeChat.

91
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,520
That hurts.

92
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Stop.

93
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
If you don't want him to die,

94
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,320
you know what to do.

95
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,400
Our agreement was

96
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,240

97
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,280
