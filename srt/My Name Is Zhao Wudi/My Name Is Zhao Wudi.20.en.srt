00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,220
(Mr. Hu set you and Shen Xingchen up.)

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,800
(He is now at No. 12, Shaoyao Road,
Yuntian District.)

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,680
What is it?

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,840
Nothing.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,640
Ma Liu wants me to go to the company.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
I'll come with you.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,920
No need.

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,080
I'll go on my own.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Stay home and rest.

34
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I'll be right back.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm going now.

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,620
(Rainbow Hotel)

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,140
(Chenyi)

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,960
Zhao Wudi,

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
we meet again.

40
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
What kind of show
have you prepared today?

41
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,640
You seem different today.

42
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,240
You seem manlier than usual.

43
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
Haven't you sobered up
since the last time?

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,480
Do you need a hand?

45
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,760
Why isn't he home yet?

46
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
(If you want to know the truth,)

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,440
(come to this place.)

48
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
(No. 12, Shaoyao Road, Yuntian District.)

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Wait in the car.

50
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,670
If we don't come out in 10 minutes,
call the police.

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
Be focused and ready, everyone.

52
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Miss Shen,

53
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,400
isn't it too dangerous to do this?

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,680
They've been targeting you.

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
What if it's a trap?

56
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,240
I need to go in even if it's a trap.

57
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,080
Let's go.

58
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,040
Let's go.

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,040
Xingyu.

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
Wudi.

61
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Why are you here?

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,280
You shouldn't come.

63
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,840
What?

64
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
Am I your burden here?

65
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,880
No.

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
You are my concern.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
What a time to show off your love.

68
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,160
How disgusting.

69
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,160
Zhao Wudi,

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,040
we've gone through life and death,

71
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
so you gotta remember me.

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,400
Gorgeous,

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,040
let Wudi go now.

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,880
If you're capable,

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
we'll fight one-on-one.

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,960
What did you say?

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,320
Let Wudi go.

78
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,960
Okay.

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
Wudi.

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,200
Bye.

81
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,800
Help me up.

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,910
He crushed me.

83
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,960
Are you okay?

84
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm okay.

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm glad you're okay.

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
What did she mean by that?

87
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
What's going on between you two?

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
She is probably attracted to my charm

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
and wants to seduce me.

90
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,200
You're such a womanizer.

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,080
Yeah.

92
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,640
He shouldn't hit on other girls.
Right, Miss Shen?

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Next time,

94
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,200
never come to places like this.

95
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Why not?

96
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,560
Are you worried that I'd stop your fun?

97
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
It's too dangerous.

98
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,760
I was worried for you.

99
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
Fine, I won't come anymore.

100
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,800
Still watching?

101
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
Get to work.

102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,680
Go look for clues.

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,120
What's there to see?

104
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,400
What's there to see?

105
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,760
Honey,

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,360
I've thought about it.

107
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,440
After this is over,

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,400
let's have a proper wedding.

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,520
Best if we get registered.

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,120
Wudi,

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
I received a video file.

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,840
It's about my brother.

113
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I got it too.

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
Where were you?

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
My brother wasn't dead.

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
Why didn't you save him?

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Wudi, Miss Shen.

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,280
Come and see this.

119
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,520
Wudi,

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
isn't this you?

121
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Who is this?

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Wudi, who is it?

123
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
I need an explanation.

124
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,520
This was taken
during a combat drill years ago.

125
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
This looks nothing like a training photo.

126
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,800
Xingyu, don't you trust me?

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,120
Xingyu.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
