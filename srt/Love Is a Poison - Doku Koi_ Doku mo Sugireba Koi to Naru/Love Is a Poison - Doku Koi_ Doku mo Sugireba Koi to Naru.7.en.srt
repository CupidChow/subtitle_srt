1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,549
For the first time in my life,
I fell in love.

2
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,552
I'm…

3
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,255
I'm in love with you.

4
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,191
But that's what I like about you.

5
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,996
And for the first time in my life,
I had a boyfriend.

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,703
Right now,

7
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,541
I'm enjoying a sweet life
with my sweetheart.

8
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,379
Here. Yours is ready, Ryo.

9
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,214
Thanks.

10
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,349
Yeah.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,188
How is it?

12
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,524
What is this?

13
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,126
It tastes different than usual.

14
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,996
I knew you'd notice, Ryo!
I baked it from scratch.

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,497
You home-baked this?

16
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,466
No wonder it's good!

17
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,834
I'm so glad!

18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,336
I have homemade jam
over there too, come on!

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,008
There we go.

20
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:18,945
Look, strawberry.

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,114
How did you know I liked strawberry jam?

22
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,918
Well, I can see right through you, Ryo.

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:28,988
Here.

24
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,957
Give it here.

25
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,966
I feel so happy.
Is it okay for me to be this happy?

26
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,506
Hey, Ryo.

27
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,810
I have a favor to ask you.

28
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,479
Hmm?

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,421
There's somewhere I want to go
with you on your next day off.

30
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,630
I didn't think the place Haruto
wanted to go to would be here.

31
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,247
JINYA: THE GLOBALLY-FAMOUS
HOT SPRING OF TSURUMAKI

32
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,815
Going to a hot spring?

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,320
Wait, but Shiba,
didn't you hate hot springs?

34
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,723
What?

35
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,325
You said so before.

36
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,528
"Hot springs are just a place

37
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:46,533
where you soak in a mixture of
an unknown number of people's body fluids.

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,736
How could that ever feel like paradise?"

39
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,738
Uh, well…

40
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,908
it's that one friend of mine.

41
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,875
Your friend?

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,914
You mean that one friend
who was asked out by the same sex?

43
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,015
Yes.

44
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:08,388
That friend's going to a hot spring
with the guy,

45
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,323
so he asked for a good place.

46
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,928
So that means,
they're officially a couple now?

47
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:18,998
Yes.

48
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,367
Really!

49
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,835
I'm so glad!

50
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,238
Congrats!

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,509
Thank you.

52
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,145
Uh, I mean, I will tell him that.

53
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,550
Congrats!

54
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,422
Is that…

55
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,091
Oh, did you notice?

56
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,395
Of course you would. Since it's so shiny.

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,032
Ta-da! It's the couple ring
I share with my boyfriend.

58
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,537
When I wear this,
I feel like I'm always connected with him.

59
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,807
Connected…

60
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,211
How nice, going to a hot spring
with your boyfriend.

61
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:12,085
It's going to be a super sweet
and spicy night for them.

62
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,553
Oh, so bright.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,888
I thought something was bright,
but it was you!

64
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,958
Ah, you're too bright!

65
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,360
You're gleaming! Oh my god!

66
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:28,067
Amazing. You're twice as bright
as everyone thinks! Incredible!

67
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:32,105
A sweet and spicy night?

68
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,282
Ryo.

69
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,249
Ryo.

70
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,550
Ryo.

71
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,353
Make me all yours.

72
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,222
Isn't that…

73
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,827
It's great weather!
Perfect for hot springs.

74
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,564
Oh. Morning, Ryo!

75
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,565
Yeah.

76
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,835
You got bags under your eyes.

77
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,837
You couldn't sleep, huh?

78
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,405
No.

79
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,274
You're so cute, Ryo.

80
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,978
You're like a kid going on a field trip.

81
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,950
Okay!

82
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,720
Everyone, watch the house
while we're gone!

83
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,592
A kid? How easygoing of him!

84
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,061
Oh, what do you want for souvenirs?

85
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,364
Well, for m-me…

86
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,033
Then you pick on behalf
of everyone, Felix!

87
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:47,707
I'm sick with worry over being able
to spend a sweet and spicy night with you!

88
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,075
Okay, let's go, Ryo!

89
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,443
Yeah.

90
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,578
Okay, here!

91
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,418
Wow!

92
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,553
It's so pretty!

93
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,690
Why don't we take a photo?

94
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,826
A photo?

95
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,896
- Let's take one! I brought this!
- No, it's okay.

96
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,597
Okay! Here we go!

97
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,232
Hey! I'm taking it!

98
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,768
Then let's start with the hand heart.
Come on! Hey!

99
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,604
Come on, here we go! Here, pose!

100
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,177
Then cat ears next!

101
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,711
- Ryo, cat ears!
- Jeez, let's go.

102
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,413
- Okay, say cheese!
- I'm a dog person.

103
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,852
You were super into it!
You're good at this.

104
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,786
That's enough.

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,123
Then the last one's
the finger heart pose! Hey, hurry!

106
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,524
- The finger heart!
- Finger heart?

107
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,959
- Yeah, here we go!
- It's enough.

108
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,761
Okay, pose!

109
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,865
How do you know that?

110
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,500
- What?
- Did you look it up?

111
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,269
Let's go already.

112
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,581
Ryo, what did you wish for?

113
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,516
It's a secret.

114
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,052
That can only be one thing.

115
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,019
Ryo.

116
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:13,125
To be able to spend
a sweet and spicy night with you.

117
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,528
It's about me, huh?

118
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,498
No!

119
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,535
Ba-dump, ba-dump?

120
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,971
Ba-dump, ba-dump…

121
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:30,977
Is my heart pounding
because I'm enjoying the trip?

122
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,578
Or…

123
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,684
is my heart pounding
because I'm anxious about nightfall?

124
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,020
Thanks for waiting!

125
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,090
I bought it!

126
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,825
Just one?

127
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,061
Oh, it'll ruin our appetite
before dinner if we each ate one.

128
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,196
So let's halve it.

129
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,831
That's true.

130
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,766
Yeah. Then I'll have some first.

131
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,040
It's good!

132
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,180
Ryo, say "ah"!

133
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,621
How is it?

134
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,523
Good.

135
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:18,891
Right?

136
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,297
So good!

137
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,635
Here, last one.

138
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,217
Hey, we're halving it!

139
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,686
But it's too yummy! Sorry!

140
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,620
Hey!

141
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,195
Wow, awesome!

142
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,965
It's super pretty! And big!

143
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,701
Wow, it's tatami!

144
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,539
Tatami's so nice! It's relaxing.

145
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,707
Really?

146
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,075
Huh? Oh!

147
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:17,950
Found them.

148
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,385
Hmm?

149
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,629
Ryo.

150
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,872
Ryo, you look good in a yukata.
So handsome.

151
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,609
You too.

152
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,644
Hmm?

153
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,412
You look really good in it too.

154
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,014
Really?

155
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,914
Too close.

156
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,815
What? Too far?

157
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,317
Like I said, too close.

158
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,521
Ryo, hurry up!

159
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,690
You're too loud.

160
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,693
Why not? We have it all to ourselves!

161
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,829
I bet you're just embarrassed!

162
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,132
No.

163
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,935
Don't worry! I can't see anything
with all the steam!

164
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,148
You saw it, huh?

165
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,783
I didn't.

166
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,286
See? Doesn't it feel good?

167
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,156
Yeah.

168
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,031
Thanks, Ryo.

169
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,435
Huh?

170
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,007
You know, it was my dream to go
to a hot spring with my boyfriend.

171
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,509
Thanks to you, my dream came true.

172
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,480
You're exaggerating saying it's a dream.

173
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,781
I'm not exaggerating.

174
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,353
I've always dreamed of this.

175
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,359
Because in my life, I never thought
anything as happy as this would happen.

176
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,274
Ryo.

177
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,715
I told the staff beforehand
that we only needed one futon laid out.

178
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,024
Was that bad?

179
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,928
No, it's not bad.

180
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,666
Haruto.

181
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,235
Hmm?

182
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,573
I want to hand you a gift
to commemorate our trip today.

183
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,742
A gift?

184
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,070
Um, but if you don't like it…

185
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,113
Ryo.

186
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:55,761
Um, what am I supposed to do after this?

187
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,197
Ryo.

188
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,838
Sorry.

189
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,839
No, don't be.

190
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,506
Oh. This?

191
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,208
Yeah.

192
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,843
It's nothing.

193
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,679
Uh, but…

194
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,013
Hey, Ryo.

195
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,718
Are you curious about my past?

196
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,895
For me, rather than what's in the past,

197
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,832
it's more important that
I can be with you right now.

198
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,404
What a coincidence.

199
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,573
Hmm?

200
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,111
I was thinking the exact same thing.

201
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,516
Ryo.

202
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,823
Haruto.

203
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,291
Hmm?

204
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,630
For me, um…

205
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,069
this type of thing… is my first time.

206
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
Don't worry.

207
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,479
Don't be scared.

208
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,973
And so…

209
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,343
we made love for the first time.

210
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,051
Thank you.

211
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,587
Thanks to you,

212
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:41,927
I was able to spend
a super sweet and spicy night.

213
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,138
Haruto?

214
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,075
Are you okay?

215
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,814
What on kind of past are you carrying?

216
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,016
It's those real estate scammers.

217
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,252
Because Haru is our patron.

218
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,457
I don't know anything about Haruto's past.

219
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,959
The encounter at the bar…

220
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,962
And reuniting at the campgrounds…

221
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,932
Were those all really a coincidence?

222
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:26,071
Was there some kind of reason
for him to get close to me?

223
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,646
Ryo.

224
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,851
Are you okay? You were restless.

225
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,153
I'm okay.

226
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,591
I just had a bit of a nightmare.

227
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,725
But…

228
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,894
Hey…

229
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,064
hold me in your arms.

230
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,443
So I don't get any nightmares.

231
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,766
Please don't ever let go.

232
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:35,841
I'm going to trust my lover's warmth
that I feel right now.

233
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,783
If you're gonna stand beside me,
you'll have to dress appropriately.

234
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,919
Why did you choose this guy
as your assistant?

235
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,187
I'll get going.

236
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,389
He is my boyfriend.

237
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,957
