1
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,715
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>I'll let you die without suffering.</i>

2
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,424
I can kill you anytime I want.

3
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,394
But I'm going to fight you under the law.

4
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,597
<i>You neutralize poison with poison.</i>

5
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,932
To win against Arisuinbo,

6
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,737
a person who carries a dangerous
poison like Shiba is needed.

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,540
But still…

8
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:45,311
I have myself the ultimate partner.

9
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:51,184
My partner is Arisuinbo's son.

10
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,867
We're going to win this trial.

11
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,236
Let's win this for sure!

12
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,558
Haruto.

13
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,426
Hmm?

14
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,198
Once we win this case…

15
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,600
What?

16
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,237
No…

17
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,108
I'll tell you when the time comes.

18
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,342
Hey, what is it?

19
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,444
Are you proposing?!

20
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,947
Huh?

21
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,219
COURTHOUSE

22
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,128
I'm surprised you were able to come.

23
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,049
Your Honor,
I'd like to call in a new witness.

24
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:33,686
Plaintiff's counsel,
is the witness here within the courtroom?

25
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,990
Yes. He is.

26
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,804
Will the witness state his name please.

27
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,379
I'm Kento Haruhara.

28
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:06,019
<i>That was Haruto's real name</i>
<i>that he had been hiding all this time.</i>

29
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,287
WITNESS:
KENTO HARUHARA

30
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,222
Mr. Haruhara.

31
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:16,196
You were investigating the Arisu Group,
Nishiki Resort Development,

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,964
but why is that?

33
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,737
Because I wanted to know
the truth behind my mother's death.

34
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:29,108
Your mother's death?
What do you mean by that?

35
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,680
My mother, Mifuyu Haruhara…

36
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,218
was Takayasu Arisuinbo's mistress.

37
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,188
I am…

38
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,325
Arisuinbo's son.

39
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,427
- Son?!
- What?

40
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:53,700
The fact that he is Takayasu Arisuinbo's
son has been proven by DNA test results.

41
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,469
THE PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY IS 99.9999%

42
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,877
Send this to testing.

43
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,786
I believe that my father is involved
in my mother's death.

44
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,256
What do you mean by that?

45
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:21,194
My mother's death was treated as suicide.

46
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,931
But I suspect her suicide was staged,

47
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,668
and she was actually killed by my father,
Takayasu Arisuinbo.

48
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,638
Your Honor!

49
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,441
The witness's statement regarding
his mother is unrelated to this case!

50
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,745
Plaintiff's counsel,

51
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,649
please refrain from speaking on any topic
not directly related to this case.

52
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,651
Understood.

53
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,720
Then Mr. Haruhara…

54
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,792
I'd like to ask about Arisu Group's
Nishiki Resort Development

55
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,194
which your father is the lead of.

56
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:01,567
Regarding this company, what kind
of investigations were you conducting?

57
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:07,507
I suspected illegal acts were being done
to obstruct Anemone Capital's project.

58
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,077
That's where I made contact
with the local group holding protests,

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,780
the Kiita City
Nature Conservation Association.

60
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,184
Hello. I'm Shutaro Tanaka.
Nice to meet everyone.

61
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,924
What did you find as a result of that?

62
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:29,862
I obtained evidence on
Nishiki Resort Development's illegal acts.

63
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,702
This is the evidence the witness obtained.

64
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,170
[ACCOUNT STATEMENT]
[CHAT RECORD]

65
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:48,214
Just as this evidence shows,
the defendant, Nishiki Resort Development,

66
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,352
provided mass funds
to make up an environmental group.

67
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,255
For their own company profit,
it is clear they have illegally obstructed

68
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,158
the business of the plaintiff,
Anemone Capital.

69
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,194
That will be all, Your Honor.

70
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,667
Now, we will begin the cross-examination
by the counsel for the defense.

71
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,574
Mr. Haruhara,

72
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:20,580
you mentioned that you made contact
with the local group to investigate.

73
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,081
Yes.

74
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,254
You pretended to be a lawyer yourself
and used blackmail as a way

75
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,126
to corner the local group's
representative, Yoshitaka Ochika.

76
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,465
As a lawyer,
I will chase you to the ends of hell.

77
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,338
<i>Since the evidence is real, his goal is</i>
<i>to denounce Haruto's investigation method</i>

78
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,141
<i>to reduce the evidence's</i>
<i>probative value now.</i>

79
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,979
By the way, Mr. Haruhara,
what is your occupation?

80
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,884
I do something similar to an informant,
who gets paid by the day.

81
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,052
An informant!

82
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,054
That's right.

83
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,927
Aren't you the exclusive informant
of the plaintiff's counsel, Ryoma Shiba?

84
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,364
Not only this case.

85
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,600
But even in the past, you have leaked
information to Ryoma Shiba

86
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,203
using illegal investigation methods.

87
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,841
And Attorney Shiba has used
that information to win in court.

88
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,448
Due to this fact,
not only the witness, Kento Haruhara,

89
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:33,786
but his employer, Attorney Shiba,
should also be condemned for this.

90
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,897
Nishiki Resort Development's investigation
was not done at Attorney Shiba's orders,

91
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,600
it was all conducted
by my own will and decision.

92
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,236
That can't be true.

93
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,306
Regarding the illegality
of gathering information,

94
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,042
there are no clear rules
for this in civil trials.

95
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,544
And regarding the evidence proposed today,

96
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,848
I believe it is essential
in uncovering the truth of this case.

97
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,350
<i>The fruit of the poisonous tree…</i>

98
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,820
Let me state it again,
the evidence is factual.

99
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,424
It has nothing to do with who I am.

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,929
<i>Haruto, that was a great comeback.</i>

101
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,870
Regarding the witness's testimony
as well as the proposed evidence,

102
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,874
we will come to a decision
after it has been carefully examined.

103
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,642
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,886
Your Honor, I would like
to call my second witness.

105
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,002
WITNESS: NOBUHIKO YAMAOKA
(NISHITO CONSTRUCTION)

106
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,445
Mr. Yamaoka, you testified here last time.

107
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,248
<i>You said NISHITO Construction</i>

108
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,384
<i>withdrew because</i>
<i>of your company's financing.</i>

109
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,252
Yes.

110
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,356
You said there was no wrongful pressure
by Nishiki Resort Development.

111
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,091
Yes.

112
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,295
Is that really true?

113
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,614
My testimony from last time is not true.

114
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:50,456
I had been forced
to commit perjury for my company

115
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,794
by the top officials
of NISHITO Construction.

116
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,796
Mr. Yamaoka!

117
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,197
Order!

118
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,840
There is a document Nishiki Resort
Development sent to NISHITO Construction.

119
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,976
This is that document.

120
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,613
"If NISHITO Construction continues
business with Anemone Capital,

121
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,482
any future business will be reconsidered."

122
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,751
This is an obvious threat.

123
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,655
Mr. Yamaoka.

124
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:30,663
Why did you decide to take back
your testimony to speak the truth today?

125
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,700
That's because…

126
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:41,874
I didn't want to live my life in shame,
unable to face my kids or grandkids.

127
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,611
And…

128
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:52,918
because I regretted following everything
Attorney Hachisuka said to me.

129
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,090
What did Attorney Hachisuka say to you?

130
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:04,830
He told me, "Even if you commit
perjury, they will not prosecute you.

131
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,367
Don't worry and take the stand."

132
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,441
Your Honor, isn't this an act that insults
and violates the judicial system?

133
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,181
Attorney Hachisuka's act falls under
the penal code of inducement of perjury.

134
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,685
And due to violating the Basic Rules
on the Duties of Practicing Attorneys

135
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,354
Articles 06, 14, and 75,
he is subject to disciplinary action.

136
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,624
Based on these facts,

137
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,561
Nishiki Resort Development
wrongfully pressuring NISHITO Construction

138
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:40,966
to break off their contract with the
plaintiff Anemone Capital is now obvious.

139
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:43,903
O-Object--

140
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,972
What is it? Do you have an objection?

141
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,678
No.

142
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,331
<i>We did it, Ryo.</i>

143
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,036
<i>Yeah, it's our complete victory.</i>

144
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,773
NISHIKI RESORT DEVELOPMENT'S
ILLEGAL ACTS EXPOSED

145
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,543
I deeply apologize!

146
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,549
Starting today, you're my bitch for life.

147
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,258
Ryoma Shiba,
I swear I'll make you my bitch too.

148
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,363
Sir, it's time for the press conference.

149
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,175
Damn it!

150
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,980
Shiba, that was an outstanding victory.

151
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,715
Thank you very much.

152
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,051
I was immediately contacted
by Anemone Capital.

153
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,421
They asked for you
to become their legal advisor.

154
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,391
I cannot accept that.

155
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,894
What?

156
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,596
Because I have submitted
my resignation letter.

157
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,334
RESIGNATION LETTER

158
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,702
You mean this?

159
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,808
You are the first man
to stain Takayasu Arisuinbo's reputation.

160
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,244
I'll continue to count on you.

161
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,320
I ask for a promotion to a managing
partner with a 200% raise in pay.

162
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,655
Well, that's…

163
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,625
I will continue to win going forward.

164
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,696
Since I have the ultimate partner.

165
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,804
You win.

166
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,583
Oh, was it fun?

167
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,403
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

168
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,509
Hey, Ryo, look!
Aren't the Christmas lights cool?

169
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,312
Did you do this all yourself?

170
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,747
Yup. The tree too!

171
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,086
Look at the food too!

172
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,488
Looks tasty!

173
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,456
Right?

174
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,927
But are you sure?

175
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,565
It's Christmas after all, didn't
you want to go to a restaurant?

176
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,533
Not at all.

177
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,740
I like to relax
and eat at home with you the most.

178
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:18,918
Haruto.

179
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,885
Yes?

180
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:24,690
What?

181
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,292
Here.

182
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,327
A present?

183
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:29,795
Yeah.

184
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,830
Can I open it?

185
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,707
All right.

186
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,812
Huh?

187
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,884
BOOK OF SIX CODES

188
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,085
Isn't this…

189
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,057
Pass the bar exam.

190
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,925
What?

191
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,196
I'm going to have you
become my partner for real.

192
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,503
Could this be what you wanted
to talk about after winning the case?

193
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,505
Yeah.

194
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,310
No, it's not possible!

195
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,448
Besides, I was a fraud too.

196
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,983
I've taken care of that already.

197
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,290
I appreciate your cooperation.

198
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,758
Yeah, just leave it to me.

199
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,060
With this, I'll settle it with the victim.

200
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,663
Thank you so much.

201
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,266
Hey, Shiba.

202
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,804
Don't you think love is truly great?

203
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,340
Yes.

204
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,945
Now, you've completely graduated
from being the Ice King of the Law.

205
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,717
Yes.

206
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,087
Did you just see that face?

207
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,222
He smiled.

208
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,857
He's never done that before!

209
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,626
The money I paid for the settlement

210
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,063
will be paid back to me
after you become a lawyer.

211
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,533
Ryo…

212
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,168
If you become a lawyer,

213
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,940
you can fight Arisuinbo in court
over your mom's death.

214
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,113
Plus, you can help Yu and them too.

215
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,618
Here.

216
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,320
Okay, did everyone get one?

217
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,624
Good, then Merry Christmas!

218
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,993
Merry Christmas!

219
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,628
Thank you!

220
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,364
- Santa Haru.
- Huh?

221
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,398
Thank you.

222
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,574
If you become a lawyer, one day,

223
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:01,680
you can create a sanctuary where everyone
can live safely and restart their lives.

224
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,653
What's wrong?

225
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,521
I'll work hard!

226
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,157
I swear I'll become a lawyer!

227
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,360
Whoa!

228
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,898
Hey, Haruto.

229
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:23,869
Ryo.

230
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,775
I'm so glad I met you.

231
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,551
Ryo, I love you the most
in the entire world.

232
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,660
So do I, I love you the most
in the entire universe.

233
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,178
<i>I knew my love for you…</i>

234
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,680
<i>was a poison.</i>

235
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,579
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>this poison will ever wear off me.</i>

236
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,450
- Hey, Ryo.
- You're squashing me!

237
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,585
Where's my proposal?

238
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,986
What's that about?

239
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,354
- Don't give me that!
- Hey!

240
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,589
Where's my proposal?

241
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,090
Hey, the stew's getting cold!

242
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,292
- Then…
- Hey!

243
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,826
