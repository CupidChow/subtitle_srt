1
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,525
Thanks for everything up to now, Ryo.

2
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,744
Let's make jack-o'-lanterns!

3
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:55,989
Hmm?

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,828
Of course not.

5
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,665
You guys are the lonely ones.

6
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,335
Since all of you were attached to him.

7
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,439
I have you guys for me.

8
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,985
My life just returned to normal.

9
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,158
In court, I was on a winning streak.

10
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,326
Thank you so much!

11
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,128
It's all thanks to you, Attorney Shiba!

12
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,197
I'm glad to be of help.

13
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,698
I'm so glad I asked you!

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,300
Then please excuse me.

15
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,434
Thank you so much!

16
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,203
Shiba.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,005
The New York office contacted me.

18
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,878
They said "Ryoma Shiba's amazing!".

19
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,249
The day I become globally known as
the Guardian of the Law is not far away.

20
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,620
Thank you.

21
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,124
This was the right decision.

22
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,331
PARTNER
RYOMA SHIBA

23
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,736
And I've succeeded
in finding my 101st partner.

24
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,141
Look up court case examples
on conflicts of interest with executives.

25
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,576
Yes, certainly.

26
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,015
This is much more useful
than a useless partner.

27
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,520
More than anything, this partner
does not make my heart flutter.

28
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,892
But it does not fulfill my heart either.

29
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,728
Ryo. Say "ah."

30
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,063
The client has said

31
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,600
that they have reserved a three-star
Italian restaurant for next Monday.

32
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,769
Okay.

33
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,776
More than some three-star Italian,

34
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,546
I want to eat Haruto's rice ball.

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,709
Gosh, such terrible crooks.

36
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,544
Is something wrong?

37
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,615
Those real estate scammers,
they've produced a new victim.

38
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,090
But it looks like
the police are on their tail,

39
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,425
so it's probably just a matter of time.

40
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,898
Shiba?

41
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,068
Haruto?

42
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,870
Yes.

43
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,539
I haven't seen him lately.

44
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,242
Where are you now, Haruto?

45
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,111
Run.

46
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,046
Run before you get caught.

47
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,049
Oh!

48
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,050
Haru…

49
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,754
What?

50
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,256
Mister, do you know Haru?

51
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,825
Yeah.

52
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:57,930
Are you… his boyfriend Ryo?

53
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,502
We need to talk.

54
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,504
Huh? Uh, wait!

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,640
Boyfriend?

56
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,711
I apologize for like
getting the wrong idea.

57
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,348
Uh, well, I'm just his roommate.

58
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,052
How much has Haruto said about me?

59
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,287
- Hey!
- Hmm?

60
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,089
What's that?

61
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,124
The official contract for an investigator.

62
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,359
Here, I signed it.

63
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,494
Knowing him,

64
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,498
he's probably shared everything,
including that I'm a lawyer.

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,070
So if he gets caught,
I'll be finished too.

66
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:42,175
Haru wouldn't tell me anything about you.

67
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,344
What?

68
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,379
He's only said he has someone he likes.

69
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,283
When I asked what kind of person
you were, he said it was a secret.

70
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,154
What are you gonna eat today?

71
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,422
What are you gonna eat today?

72
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,557
Cup ramen.

73
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,958
Because we're a couple?

74
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,194
What the heck? Answer me properly!

75
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,729
Oh, Yu!

76
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,897
Yu, welcome back!

77
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,999
Who's that?

78
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,969
Haru's friend, Mr. Ryo.

79
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,108
Hey, where's Haru right now?

80
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,509
Why did he disappear?

81
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,211
Hey, where's Haru?

82
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,812
Where did he go?

83
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,013
Where's Haru?

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,015
Why do you guys care about him so much?

85
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,387
Because Haru is our patron.

86
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,356
Your patron?

87
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,261
He's always caring for us.

88
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,963
Here, Yu.

89
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,864
Thanks.

90
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,032
Make sure to stay
somewhere decent tonight.

91
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,870
All right, now for some clothes!

92
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,405
- Here!
- Oh, thank you!

93
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,473
- Here!
- Thank you!

94
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,342
- Here!
- How cute!

95
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,010
These are so cute!

96
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,745
- This is cute, huh?
- Yeah, it's cute!

97
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,080
Thank you!

98
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,481
Thanks, Haru!

99
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,216
Take care of yourselves.

100
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,351
Yes, sir!

101
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,219
Oh, and don't ever sell your bodies!

102
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,558
Haru always told to us

103
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:11,364
that he wanted to earn more money to build
a place like a sanctuary for everyone.

104
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,199
A sanctuary?

105
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,167
Yeah.

106
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,740
A place for us, kids who have
no place at home or school,

107
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:27,246
a place where we can live safely
and be able to restart our lives.

108
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,586
You're someone
who only thinks about yourself.

109
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,356
You're from the underground world.

110
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,428
Is something wrong?

111
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,231
No.

112
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,100
Where is…

113
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,639
Where is Haruto right now?

114
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,177
He only said that he's going back
to where he came from.

115
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,080
Where he came from?

116
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,148
Yeah.

117
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,218
I wonder what he meant.

118
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,461
It's from Haru.

119
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,100
Look, it's a perfectly round moon.

120
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,604
It's orange just like a jack-o'-lantern.

121
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,914
Mr. Ryo! Where are you going, Mr. Ryo?!

122
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,765
We're going soon.

123
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,834
Hey.

124
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,670
I have something to ask you.

125
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,872
What is it?

126
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,577
If this job goes well, pay me one billion.

127
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,179
Huh?

128
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,116
I know everything.

129
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,786
If this succeeds,
you guys get more than five billion yen.

130
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,255
That's why I get one billion.

131
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,858
It's cheap, right?

132
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,967
Plus, I won't ever fail.

133
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,203
I studied the law like crazy too,

134
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,372
so I've updated myself more.

135
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,243
So pay me.

136
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,521
Hey, don't get carried away.

137
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,422
Huh?

138
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,925
All you gotta do is
follow our orders, that's all.

139
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,560
All right?

140
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,832
Your cut is the same as always.

141
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,536
What are you doing? Let's go home.

142
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,777
- Ryo!
- Sorry, but he's coming with me.

143
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,847
Since his contract with me isn't up yet.

144
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,285
Come on.

145
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,288
That's not where you belong.

146
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,224
Ryo.

147
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,325
Hey.

148
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,326
Yes.

149
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:51,951
You!

150
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,420
Come on! You bastard!

151
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,991
You're super weak!

152
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,960
Don't mess with us! Hey!

153
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,429
- You finished?!
- Done already?

154
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,364
Hey!

155
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,566
Hold it! Come back here!

156
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,169
If you want them to stop,

157
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,371
you know what to do.

158
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,440
Let me go.

159
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,409
- Hey!
- Stay still!

160
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,013
Hey! Say something!

161
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,249
Ryo!

162
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,255
Haruto…

163
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,325
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,529
Huh?

165
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,965
I said something terrible to you.

166
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:48,340
I said that you're someone
who only thinks about yourself.

167
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,048
But that wasn't true.

168
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,023
You…

169
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,593
Just to save those kids…

170
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,364
you were risking your life.

171
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,367
Ryo.

172
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,304
Forgive me.

173
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,438
Shut it!

174
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,818
Hey!

175
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,427
You okay, Ryo?

176
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,601
Let's go!

177
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,232
Does it hurt?

178
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,702
You need to get treated later.

179
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,472
You're really strong.

180
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,675
Yeah.

181
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,712
Then couldn't you save me much earlier?

182
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,383
I thought you were much stronger.

183
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,185
Well, sorry!

184
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,588
You can't help that.

185
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,125
You've never hit anyone
in your life before, Ryo.

186
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,398
Fighting's all about real experience.

187
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,969
I'm not like you, Ryo.

188
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,309
Since I'm from the underground world.

189
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,154
Hey, Ryo.

190
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:25,497
Was the reason why you came to get me
because my contract wasn't finished?

191
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,935
Or because I was a useful partner?

192
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,145
It's true that you're a useful partner.

193
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,584
But that's not all.

194
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,925
When I think about you…

195
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,863
this part aches.

196
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,570
I start to tear up without any reason.

197
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,314
This means…

198
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,918
love.

199
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,489
Love?

200
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,394
I'm…

201
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,002
I'm in love with you.

202
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,127
I've known it for a while now.

203
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,402
Ryo, you know you can't leave me.

204
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,894
Ryo, you're awkward…

205
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,932
sensitive and difficult.

206
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,266
Hey!

207
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,072
But that's what I like about you.

208
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,911
I love you!

209
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,916
Huh?

210
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,212
That was the day
I learned for the first time…

211
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:36,789
that your lover's smile shines brighter
than any beautiful starlit sky.

212
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,539
Are you really sure?

213
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,311
Your body must ache
from always sleeping on the sofa.

214
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,913
Thank you, Ryo!

215
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,347
Too close!

216
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,715
It's not too close.

217
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,917
You have room over there.

218
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:05,984
No, I don't.

219
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,688
Hey, Ryo.

220
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,826
You called me Haruto
for the first time today, didn't you?

221
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,128
Did I?

222
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,729
Yeah.

223
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,399
Call my name again.

224
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,670
Good night.

225
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,179
Good night.

226
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:54,700
I didn't know sleeping with your lover
can make you feel this happy.

227
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,685
Stop! Please, stop!

228
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:22,794
Haruto?

229
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,297
Mom.

230
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:32,638
Back then, I hadn't the slightest idea…

231
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,309
about my boyfriend's tragic past.

232
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,181
Going to a hot spring?

233
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,085
Is my heart pounding
because I'm enjoying the trip?

234
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,188
Don't worry. Don't be scared.

235
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,957
