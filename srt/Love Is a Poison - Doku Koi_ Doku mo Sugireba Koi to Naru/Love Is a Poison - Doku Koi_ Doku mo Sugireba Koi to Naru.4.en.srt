1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,739
I like you.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,340
Huh?

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,478
I really like you, Ryo.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,349
I'm serious.

5
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,375
My sudden confession
must've surprised you.

6
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,847
Give me an answer whenever you're ready.

7
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,216
I'm in no rush.

8
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,827
Let's get to bed soon.

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,562
It's on you.

10
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,436
Yeah.

11
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,511
Your scent is relaxing, Ryo.

12
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,351
I'm glad we're sleeping together.

13
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,452
So, not even a wink of sleep that day?

14
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,588
No.

15
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,792
That must've been tough,
for that friend of yours.

16
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,829
Yes.

17
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,669
It was his first time being asked out.
Plus, the person was a guy.

18
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,906
He didn't know how to handle it,
so he asked me for advice.

19
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,241
Hmm.

20
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,845
So, does your friend not understand
that kind of relationship?

21
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,380
No, that's not the case.

22
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,281
Hmm.

23
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,783
But…

24
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,254
he said that he can't understand
his own feelings.

25
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,089
Can't understand?

26
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,492
He's oddly conscious of physical contact,

27
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,396
and he gets flustered at times.

28
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:55,802
That already sounds like he's in love.

29
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,704
You okay?

30
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,672
- Uh-oh!
- Shiba!

31
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,142
Are you okay?

32
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,779
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

33
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,748
Oh yeah.

34
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,785
There's an easy way to check
if you're in love or not.

35
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,987
What's that?

36
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,724
That is…

37
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,027
That is?

38
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,677
Thanks.

39
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,947
That's weird.

40
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,149
Something wrong?

41
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,183
No.

42
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,087
It's just did Mr. Shiba have any friends?

43
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,158
You're right…

44
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,797
What is this?

45
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,633
Halloween!

46
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,635
Let's make jack-o'-lanterns!

47
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,270
Jack-o'-lanterns?

48
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,641
Yup, because this room
doesn't have any seasonal touch to it.

49
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,277
No.

50
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,712
What?

51
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,013
A seasonal touch isn't needed.

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,516
No! But I want it!

53
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,321
Besides, you're a super
handsome lawyer, right?

54
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,324
Huh?

55
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,160
Then you gotta live
in a super handsome room

56
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,228
with complete seasonal décor.

57
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,030
Right?

58
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,536
Yeah.

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,372
Yeah.

60
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,642
All right!

61
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,711
Watch out!

62
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,351
First off, don't put your hand
in front of the knife.

63
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:52,885
Oh.

64
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,091
Plus, I think you're holding
the knife weird. Um…

65
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,459
Let me see it.

66
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,729
Maybe it's like this? Yeah, like this.

67
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,097
See?

68
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:09,335
No, um, this hand needs
to hold the pumpkin.

69
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,436
I know.

70
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,337
You got it?

71
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,638
Yeah.

72
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,575
All right! Let's do this.

73
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,311
Why does he have to get so close?

74
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,512
Just relax!

75
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,848
Well, at least no one's watching us.

76
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,152
Yeah, they are!

77
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,189
Make sure to relax.

78
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,024
Come on.

79
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,359
Relax.

80
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,327
Okay.

81
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,777
It's looking good.

82
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,844
Don't look.

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,282
Stop looking this way!

84
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,585
Hey! Face forward. Come on.

85
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,388
- Uh, I know.
- All right.

86
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,160
Attorney Shiba, please help me!

87
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,468
An anonymous employee
has given us information.

88
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,539
They said that
our company's Maiko Suzusaka is

89
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,809
thinking of exposing misconduct.

90
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,711
And that woman called Suzusaka is?

91
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,150
Our manager of the Intellectual Property
Department that handles patents.

92
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,023
IP DEPARTMENT MANAGER

93
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,260
Here we go.

94
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,033
A start-up that's being focused
in the energy field.

95
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,170
If there really was a misconduct,
and she exposed it,

96
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,673
the company would lose
significant credibility.

97
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,245
Ultimately, it could affect
all of Japan's energy policies.

98
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,749
Before that happens,
they want to settle it in secret.

99
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,720
So, I just need to make contact
with her and get information?

100
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,721
Yeah.

101
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,660
By the way, she's quite pretty.

102
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,198
She's pretty and looks like
she has a good fashion sense.

103
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,604
Make contact with Maiko Suzusaka…

104
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,939
That means…

105
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,717
Maiko Suzusaka.

106
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,252
Things like this…

107
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,188
Pumpkin!

108
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,823
…or that might happen too?!

109
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,291
Like this?

110
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,325
What?!

111
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,793
Huh?!

112
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,428
No,

113
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
let's not investigate--

114
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,232
All right!

115
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,335
Let's do our best
on our second tag-team round.

116
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,172
Yeah.

117
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,175
There we go.

118
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,379
Seems like she's called the Cyborg.

119
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,447
Cyborg?

120
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,850
Meaning she's hard to get.

121
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,085
Really, I see.

122
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,990
Yes, Maiko Suzusaka is a cyborg.

123
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,893
There's no way she would get
with this guy.

124
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,233
Ryo, what's wrong? You hate pumpkin?

125
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,569
No, that's not true.

126
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,653
Are you okay? Do you need help?

127
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,322
No, I'm fine.

128
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,228
Then if you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

129
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,636
This should be good for today.

130
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,409
Oh!

131
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,847
Huh?

132
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,419
You like kingfishers too?

133
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,221
Uh, yes.

134
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,059
Isn't their jade-like
structural color nice?

135
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:33,332
They say the principle of how bubbles
look iridescent applies to this color too!

136
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,234
Really, is that so?

137
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,704
Then do you know this?

138
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,842
Oh!

139
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,978
Hello.

140
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,747
Hello.

141
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,650
Do you play tennis?

142
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,851
Uh, yes.

143
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,187
I do too. Although I'm not very good yet.

144
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,490
I actually coach private lessons.

145
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,091
Really?

146
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,126
Yes.

147
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,666
And that's why
I'll be playing tennis with her soon.

148
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,603
Three days! It's only been three days!

149
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,041
That's extremely fast work to win
the cyborg's trust in just three days!

150
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,277
Also, I went and secretly followed her.

151
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,779
That's when…

152
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,350
You think I'm bluffing, don't you?
Well, I'm serious.

153
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,386
Wait!

154
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,355
Please!

155
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,691
I beg you, please!

156
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,069
I thought they were arguing
about a love affair at first,

157
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,804
but it didn't seem like it.

158
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,740
I'll send that to you,
so try looking up who that man is.

159
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,276
He seemed like he was her colleague.

160
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,344
Thanks.

161
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,219
This guy's data-gathering skills
are extraordinary.

162
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,321
But…

163
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,594
this is more like he's doing the using
and I'm the one being used!

164
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,031
Our positions are reversed!

165
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,366
Whoa!

166
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,736
Meat!

167
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,372
Oh, but Ryo, how did you know
that I wanted to eat meat today?

168
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,908
Huh?

169
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,377
How's the water taste?

170
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,049
I wanna eat something meaty.

171
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,786
Like those big drumsticks
that come out in manga.

172
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,422
Ouch.

173
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,762
I just had a feeling.

174
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,363
Hmm.

175
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,834
This kinda makes me happy.
We must be telepathic!

176
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,474
Come over here.

177
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,442
- Huh?
- Here we go!

178
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,544
- Okay.
- Here.

179
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,478
What is it?

180
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,248
Around here…

181
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,250
Um, about here maybe.

182
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,018
- What is it?
- Face that way.

183
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,120
Okay. Keep your eyes closed like this.

184
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,922
All right.

185
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,992
What is this?

186
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,899
Okay, go ahead.

187
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,973
Happy Halloween.

188
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:33,879
Isn't it pretty?

189
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,108
Hmm?

190
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,479
Come on.

191
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,117
What are you saying? You got it all wrong.

192
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,287
The word love is not in my dictionary.

193
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,625
Felix, not you too.

194
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,201
Do you know this man?

195
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,641
Our manager of Research and Development…

196
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,544
The man Maiko Suzusaka was with

197
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:43,015
turns out to be New Energy Laboratory's
R&D manager, Takashi Mizusaki.

198
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,252
If the R&D department is involved
with the misconduct,

199
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,653
this could become a big case.

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,689
Then I'll go and pull out
that information from her.

201
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,558
Right now?

202
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,461
Yeah, I'm going to play tennis
with her right now.

203
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,132
But, I feel like she's targeting me.

204
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,567
Targeting?

205
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,769
Umm, she's like…

206
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,105
"I've never clicked
with someone like this before."

207
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,374
"You came out in my dreams last night."

208
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,777
"I can't wait till the day
we play tennis together."

209
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,147
Don't tell me…

210
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,550
my imagination's gonna come true?

211
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,222
It'll be a pain if she gets serious,
so I'll keep it business.

212
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,690
See ya.

213
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,963
Yeah, he's just making contact
with her for work.

214
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,544
Sorry to keep you waiting!

215
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,083
Then shall we start?

216
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,519
Yes. Thank you for coaching today.

217
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,620
Not at all.

218
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,904
Good, yes, now bend your wrist like this.

219
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,673
- Right, this part.
- Here?

220
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,109
And this part is
like swatting with your hand.

221
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,377
- I'm sorry.
- I apologize.

222
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,012
- I was close, sorry.
- Don't worry!

223
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,413
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

224
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,514
Then one more time.

225
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,518
Oh!

226
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,321
- That was good!
- Wow! It went in!

227
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,867
We've just finished tennis. I'm hungry!

228
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,240
Something easily digestible
and high in protein.

229
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,975
After sports, it's gotta be this.

230
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,044
HAKATA-STYLE CHICKEN HOT POT

231
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,212
HARUTO

232
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,514
I'm gonna eat chicken hot pot
with Ms. Maiko!

233
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,757
SAKAEYA
CHARCOAL-GRILL & CHICKEN HOT POT

234
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,625
Thanks for the meal.

235
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,694
- It was tasty!
- It really was.

236
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,964
I came here because I wanted
to hear the information

237
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,133
on Maiko Suzusaka as soon as possible.

238
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,667
That's all.

239
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,337
Oh, are you okay, Ms. Maiko?

240
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,419
You're so kind.

241
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,221
Really?

242
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,830
I want you to be even kinder to me today.

243
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,334
Then just this time.

244
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,108
Okay, let's get the taxi.

245
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,545
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

246
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,780
- Be careful.
- Okay.

247
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,072
This is…

248
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,909
This pain is…

249
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,748
There's an easy way to check
if you're in love or not.

250
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,749
What's that?

251
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,587
If you see that person together
with someone else

252
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,022
and you get jealous or not.

253
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,461
I like you.

254
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,231
I really like you, Ryo.

255
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,266
That slightly awkward side of you,

256
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,835
as well as how you
enjoy eating my cooking too.

257
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,971
I like it all.

258
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,386
I can't… deny it any longer.

259
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,693
I've…

260
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,496
Fallen…

261
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,269
in love.

262
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,048
I don't cheat.

263
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,217
I knew that love was a poison to me.

264
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,352
Just leave my place at once.

265
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,821
Thanks for everything up to now, Ryo.

266
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,890
