1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,139
Haruto's dad is…

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,345
the boss of Arisu Group,
Takayasu Arisuinbo.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,581
Haruto!

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:22,622
That means I've dragged Haruto
into a battle against his real dad!

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,938
Haruto, I drove you into a corner.

6
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,421
I've snuck in successfully!

7
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,321
HARUTO

8
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,824
KIITA CITY NATURE CONSERVATION
ASSOCIATION - REGULAR MEETING

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,660
Today, we have a new member joining us.

10
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,728
YOSHITAKA OCHIKA

11
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:02,462
Tanaka!

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,905
Hello. I'm Shutaro Tanaka.

13
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,843
I was born and raised
in this nature-filled area,

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,211
and I love this city.

15
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,048
That is why I am completely
against the entertainment facility

16
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,750
that will destroy our environment.

17
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,351
Nice to meet everyone.

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,724
Ryo, just you wait.

19
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,262
I'll come back
with the best gift for you in my hands.

20
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,732
He was still continuing the investigation?

21
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,304
Because I will always be
on your side, Ryo.

22
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,659
Have a good night!

23
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,894
Have a good night!

24
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,668
I can do the rest myself,
so you can go home now.

25
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,503
I'm a newcomer so I should help out.

26
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,675
I can really tell
after participating today

27
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,911
how dedicated everyone is.

28
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,347
They truly want
to protect this city's nature.

29
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,050
Yeah. That's true.

30
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,288
Everyone except for you.

31
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,590
What?

32
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,129
You're not interested
in environmental protection.

33
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,165
You're only interested in money.

34
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,636
Hey. What are you talking about?!

35
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,073
Do you know what this badge is for?

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,376
A lawyer?

37
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,679
I received some suspicious information.

38
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,417
It stated that this group was receiving
illegal funds from Arisuinbo.

39
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,756
You are using the members
under the guise of nature conservation.

40
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,328
If you are receiving money to obstruct
Anemone Capital's construction project,

41
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,964
that'd be fraudulent
obstruction of business.

42
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,398
F-F…

43
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,500
That's a very nice watch you're wearing.

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,103
Did you buy it
with the money you received?

45
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,639
No, this, wait, this isn't…

46
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,876
If you don't tell the truth now,
you'll be in big trouble.

47
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,045
Big trouble?

48
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,724
As a lawyer,
I will chase you to the ends of hell.

49
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:33,973
ACCOUNT STATEMENT

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,742
Mission accomplished.

51
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,814
So stupid. Can't believe he fell for this.

52
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,089
It's not too sweet. It's tasty.

53
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,925
I feel kind of hungry.

54
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,063
What should I eat with Ryo today?

55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,068
Maybe meat?

56
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,652
I'm hungry. I'm coming home now.

57
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,353
I'm sorry, Ryo…

58
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,258
I don't think I can come home to you.

59
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,348
Mom.

60
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,661
Mom.

61
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,566
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

62
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
I guess…

63
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,945
I'm incapable of protecting
the ones I love.

64
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,514
Long time no see…

65
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,218
Dad.

66
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,961
Our director told me
to take over Anemone Capital's case.

67
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,936
It's not too late.
If you go and apologize--

68
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,706
Tomorrow, I'll take my letter
of resignation to the office.

69
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,242
Shiba!

70
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,680
Are you going to ruin your entire life
because of some fleeting emotion?

71
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,551
If I break up with him…

72
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,189
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

73
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,526
I really like you, Ryo.

74
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,330
Let's win this for sure.
Since we're the ultimate duo.

75
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,599
I'll always stand by you
no matter what happens!

76
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,372
I don't need to win.

77
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,475
What?

78
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,747
Even if I don't get promoted…

79
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,683
Even if I quit being a lawyer…

80
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,687
as long as I have Haruto, I don't care.

81
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,464
You've changed, Shiba.

82
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,135
You who were once called the cold
and merciless Ice King of the Law.

83
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,441
Love sure changes people.

84
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,951
You look like that woman.

85
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,921
That woman?

86
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,258
Your overly greedy mother.

87
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,993
Shut up!

88
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,265
Kill him.

89
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,166
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,077
Don't worry,
I'll let you die without suffering.

91
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,485
Haruto, what are you doing?

92
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,394
Could he be…

93
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,283
I'm home, Ryo.

94
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,023
Ow!

95
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,091
Just bear with it.

96
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,192
Okay.

97
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,861
Look up, it's hard to do it.

98
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,708
Did you hurt yourself while cooking?

99
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,078
What?

100
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,249
You know you can't cook, Ryo.

101
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,451
Were you that hungry?

102
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,989
I wanted to make you food.

103
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,062
I see.

104
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,641
Haruto.

105
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,576
Hmm?

106
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,482
You're Arisuinbo's son, right?

107
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,957
I'm sorry.

108
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:13,999
I've dragged you
into a battle against your dad.

109
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,772
I've never thought of that guy as my dad.

110
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,299
You bastard!

111
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,446
I can kill you anytime I want.

112
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,587
But I'm going to fight you under the law.

113
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,394
I will never forgive you.

114
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,400
And don't you ever
touch my partner, got that?

115
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:27,439
My mom was Arisuinbo's mistress.

116
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,546
But even after I was born,
he never paid any child support.

117
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,983
My mom couldn't work
due to her weak health,

118
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,519
so we were really poor.

119
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:49,328
My mom was trying to prosecute him for me.

120
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,697
What?

121
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,668
She found evidence
of his underground business.

122
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,371
She told him to pay child support
if he didn't want to be exposed.

123
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,844
But some dangerous thugs started
coming to our house.

124
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,861
Mom!

125
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,380
I tried to protect my mom.

126
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,783
But I couldn't protect her in the end.

127
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:52,358
Not long after, my mom committed suicide.

128
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,059
What?

129
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,961
But she couldn't have.

130
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,298
There's no way
my mom would've left me and died.

131
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,635
He killed her.

132
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,206
Didn't you ask anyone for help?

133
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,875
I did, I went to all sorts…

134
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,779
To a lawyer too.

135
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,615
But no one took me seriously.

136
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,955
Then… I met you, Ryo.

137
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,696
A lawyer, just like those
I hated for not having helped me.

138
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,431
Ouch!

139
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,501
This is for you. Please use it.

140
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,703
Um, have you seen Haruto?

141
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,338
No, I haven't.

142
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,706
Really?

143
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,309
I was curious about what kind
of people lawyers were,

144
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,077
that's why I got close to you.

145
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:49,982
But…

146
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,619
I caught feelings for you right away.

147
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,258
And then…

148
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,863
I found out that
your old nemesis was Arisuinbo.

149
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,037
Why…

150
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,775
Why didn't you tell me
that you were Arisuinbo's son?

151
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,145
How could I?

152
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,618
If you knew that guy's blood
runs through my veins…

153
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,557
I thought you might hate me.

154
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,727
Don't be stupid!

155
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,732
I would never hate you
for something like that!

156
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,842
Haruto.

157
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,856
You are my precious boyfriend.

158
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,498
It doesn't matter whose child you are.

159
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,674
Ryo…

160
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,147
please take down Arisuinbo with me.

161
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,421
Yeah.

162
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,967
Sir, I've made my decision.

163
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,008
RESIGNATION LETTER

164
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:56,975
What?

165
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,477
Shiba!

166
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,048
I don't intend to cut ties
with my partner.

167
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:08,087
But please let me handle
Anemone Capital's case till the end.

168
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,723
I've already reassigned
the case to Kazama.

169
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,425
Sir!

170
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,164
I cannot win this case.

171
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,632
Kazama…

172
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,603
You neutralize poison with poison.

173
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,439
To win against Arisuinbo,

174
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,377
a person who carries a dangerous
poison like Shiba is needed.

175
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,847
But still…

176
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,551
I have myself the ultimate partner.

177
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,657
My partner is Arisuinbo's son.

178
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,490
We're going to win this trial.

179
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,859
Let's win this for sure!

180
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,848
Are you proposing?!

181
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,583
I'm surprised you were able to come.

182
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,152
Your Honor,
I'd like to call in a new witness.
