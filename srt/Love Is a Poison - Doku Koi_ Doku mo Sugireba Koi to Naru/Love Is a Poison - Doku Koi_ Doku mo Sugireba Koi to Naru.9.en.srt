1
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,349
This is the only man
I've ever lost to in court.

2
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,986
I was stupid
for overestimating your abilities.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,090
I blamed myself for not being able
to live up to his expectations.

4
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,393
However…

5
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,863
there was another reason why I lost.

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,934
Hachisuka was connected to Arisuinbo
who was the defendant in that trial.

7
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,603
This trial,

8
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,273
Hachisuka will fight as
the defense attorney for Arisuinbo's side.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,174
I…

10
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,476
want to win against them this time.

11
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,611
I wanna win.

12
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,915
I wanna win too.

13
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,055
They did something messed up
to you. We can't let them go.

14
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,297
I'll explain the key points of this case.

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,669
The client is an independent
investment bank, Anemone Capital.

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,604
They're a rapidly growing company

17
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,607
that's also expanding
into the real estate industry lately.

18
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,410
Plaintiff, Anemone Capital.

19
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,479
As part of that business,

20
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:23,683
they were working on a large entertainment
facility project in the suburbs of Tokyo.

21
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:28,521
Total construction cost is 20 billion.
That's a huge project.

22
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,860
However, the general contractor
that signed a construction contract,

23
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,996
NISHITO Construction,
canceled without any notice.

24
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,065
NISHITO CONSTRUCTION

25
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,100
Why?

26
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:45,472
It looks like one of Arisuinbo Group's
companies led by Takayasu Arisuinbo,

27
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,275
Nishiki Resort Development,
put wrongful pressure on them.

28
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,277
ARISUINBO

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,748
And the reason they pressured them?

30
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,919
Their goal is to intervene
with the project

31
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:04,124
and buy up the development site cheaply.

32
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,195
Anemone Capital is going to fight
Nishiki Resort Development in court

33
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,032
after filing a lawsuit
for 20.5 billion yen in damages.

34
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:19,472
Our mission is to expose
Nishiki Resort Development's illegal acts.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,541
Yeah.

36
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,712
Hey.

37
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,883
Let's win this for sure.

38
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,286
Since we're the ultimate duo.

39
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:55,942
NISHITO CONSTRUCTION SALES MANAGER
NOBUHIKO YAMAOKA

40
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,816
Ugh, so big!

41
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:10,290
If you can barely touch live bait,
why are you even fishing?

42
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:16,062
Uh, well, my boss loves to fish.

43
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,096
What?

44
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,100
He's someone I look up to,
so I want to accompany him one day.

45
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:26,172
That's why I'm secretly practicing
on my own, so I don't cause him trouble.

46
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,307
Oh, really.

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,811
It's rare these days to want
to go fishing with your boss.

48
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,149
You, what do you do for a living?

49
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,818
I work at a construction company.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,719
What?

51
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,355
So do I.

52
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:43,856
What a coincidence.

53
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,892
Oh, yes.

54
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,928
Hold here with your right hand.

55
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,496
Uh, l-like this?

56
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,132
Whoa, I got something! It's super heavy!

57
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,068
- Wow!
- It might be a big one!

58
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,135
Crap! What do I do?

59
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,837
Slowly! Don't rush it! Slowly!

60
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,372
Slowly!

61
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,308
Oh…

62
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,443
It was this.

63
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,045
Nice fishing with you.
I'll have some, thank you.

64
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,819
Master!

65
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,720
Hmm?

66
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,691
Um, there's something I'd like to ask you.

67
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,402
The reason NISHITO Construction canceled
the contract was just as we thought,

68
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,405
they were repeatedly pressured
by Nishiki Resort Development.

69
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,706
So it was true.

70
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,541
I found something as well.

71
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,243
What?

72
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,714
Around the construction site, there were
protests held by an environmental group.

73
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:48,054
The entertainment facility's construction
start was delayed due to these protests,

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,323
and the contract ended up being canceled.

75
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,959
FIGHT RESORT CONSTRUCTION

76
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,095
The Kiita City
Nature Conservation Association?

77
00:04:56,162 --> 00:05:00,533
I've looked them up online, but this
group's website was already shut down.

78
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,170
The members' whereabouts are unknown too.

79
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,740
That sounds fishy.

80
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,021
NO RESORT CONSTRUCTION

81
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,690
REDEVELOPMENT CONTAMINATES THE WATERS

82
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,058
PROTECT NATURE OR NO FUTURE!!

83
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,799
Oh, excuse me.

84
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,436
Um, I'd like to ask you about
the empty construction site.

85
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,271
So cold!

86
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,174
How was it?

87
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:45,878
I went to city hall, but I just got passed
around different departments

88
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,647
and couldn't find anyone involved.

89
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,382
I see.

90
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,583
Me neither.

91
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,853
I interviewed all kinds of people,
but I couldn't find any clues.

92
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,190
It's strange to have so few leads.

93
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:05,998
Were the environmental group's
protests also manipulated by Arisuinbo?

94
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,805
You want me to drive?

95
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,408
It's okay.

96
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,044
Thank you for waiting. Enjoy!

97
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,713
I heard the honey toast here
is super good.

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,115
Let's eat it together.

99
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,182
I don't want any.

100
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,717
What?

101
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,221
We don't have any leads.
This is no time to be eating.

102
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,064
To work harder from here, we need to eat.

103
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,767
Here.

104
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,583
Is it good?

105
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,790
It's edible.

106
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,796
What? What's so funny?

107
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,432
- It's nothing.
- Tell me!

108
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,667
Use this.

109
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,439
Mr. Hachisuka.

110
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,576
You've got some on you.

111
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:33,619
Shiba, it must be a twist of fate
to meet you in a place like this.

112
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,256
It's not too late.

113
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,093
Why don't you come work for me?

114
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,129
I'll pay you double…

115
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,599
No, ten times your current pay.

116
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,700
I decline.

117
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,403
Huh…

118
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,972
I'm surprised.

119
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,476
Can I ask you one question?

120
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,244
What?

121
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,714
When I was still a novice,

122
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,652
why did you make me handle
Arisuinbo's case?

123
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:13,392
There's only one reason for that.
That's because you were highly competent.

124
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:20,166
That's also why I wanted you to learn both
the light and dark side of things early.

125
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,935
The light and dark side?

126
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,970
Yeah.

127
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,407
I think that defeat helped you to grow.

128
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,277
Didn't you just want to get rid of me?

129
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,112
Huh?

130
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,882
Weren't you just trying
to crush the rookie

131
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,618
who may have threatened your position?

132
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,623
You threaten me?

133
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,394
That's very funny.

134
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,301
But what happened to you of all people?

135
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,840
If you mix business with personal affairs,
it's going to affect work.

136
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,843
What?

137
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:12,852
Making your boyfriend your work assistant?

138
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,892
Looks like I've hit a bull's-eye.

139
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:30,002
But I think you could find
someone much better.

140
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,808
Shut up!

141
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,751
He is the best partner I could ask for.

142
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,491
I see.

143
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,164
I'll see you in court.

144
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,242
Nishiki Resort Development
putting pressure on NISHITO Construction…

145
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:15,414
that fact has no objective evidence.
Mr. Yamaoka's testimony is our only hope.

146
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,586
But I doubt
Mr. Yamaoka would testify in court

147
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,990
something that would put
his company at a disadvantage.

148
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,834
I can't win the case this way.

149
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,356
I'm going out!

150
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,362
Mr. Yamaoka!

151
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,131
Hmm? Oh, it's you!

152
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,600
Oh yeah, I'll show you something cool!

153
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,803
Today, I caught a real big one
you won't believe!

154
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,871
Please!

155
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,340
Hey, what's the matter?

156
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,043
Please testify in court!

157
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,446
C-Court?

158
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,584
Mr. Yamaoka,
your testimony is our only hope!

159
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,255
I beg of you please!

160
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,263
Haruto.

161
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,265
I'm fine!

162
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,167
Please!

163
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,538
And you are?

164
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,940
My name's Shiba, a lawyer.

165
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,244
If I become a witness,

166
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,148
that could possibly put myself
against my company.

167
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,718
That's an understandable concern.

168
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,256
They could even terminate me that way.

169
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,428
You said yourself that
you couldn't accept it.

170
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,764
What?

171
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,734
You said the Kiita City's
entertainment facility was

172
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,037
supposed to be the highlight
of your career.

173
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,208
Once it was built, you were
going to take your grandkids,

174
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,177
and brag to them saying,
"Grandpa worked hard on this!"

175
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,446
…I was going to brag to them.

176
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,091
There's no way we can accept this either.

177
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,371
Me too. I can't let this go either.

178
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,245
Mr. Yamaoka.

179
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,557
All right.

180
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,060
I'll be a witness.

181
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,801
Thank you so much.

182
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,803
Thank you so much.

183
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,408
- Oh! Here it is!
- You got a catch!

184
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,944
- Oh!
- It's a big one!

185
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,679
What are you doing?

186
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,447
What are you doing?

187
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,051
Thanks, Haruto.

188
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,956
Now, I can beat Hachisuka.

189
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,796
And so, the trial began.

190
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,770
The court is now in session.

191
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,977
Mr. Yamaoka, when NISHITO Construction
signed the contract

192
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,782
but canceled it without any notice,
please tell us in detail what happened.

193
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,889
I was left in utter disbelief.

194
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,459
For my subordinates and I,

195
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,863
this was the biggest project
we broke our backs to work on.

196
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,436
But due to our company's decision,
we had to withdraw from it midway.

197
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,771
Mr. Yamaoka.

198
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:38,711
Why did NISHITO Construction have
to withdraw from the project midway?

199
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,250
What on earth happened there?

200
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:01,467
The start of the construction was delayed,
and we could not foresee enough profit.

201
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,003
What?

202
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,605
It was a problem
of our company's financing.

203
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:15,314
Mr. Yamaoka, that sounds different
from what you mentioned before.

204
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,017
No, this is the truth.

205
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,488
But you said that the reason
NISHITO Construction withdrew midway

206
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,392
was due to Nishiki Resort Development's
wrongful pressure.

207
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,763
No, there were no such acts whatsoever.

208
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,098
No way.

209
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,317
One more.

210
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,218
Aren't you overdrinking? You okay?

211
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,253
One more.

212
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,754
Yes.

213
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,993
Ryo, I fail as your partner.

214
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,398
If I had just kept a firm grip
on Mr. Yamaoka's feelings,

215
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,667
this wouldn't have happened.

216
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,773
It's all due to my own lack of abilities.

217
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,179
I can't beat Hachisuka after all.

218
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,281
Ryo.

219
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,653
One more.

220
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,389
We're leaving!

221
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,758
One more.

222
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,863
Hey!

223
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,534
Ryo, you idiot!

224
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,803
Of course you can beat him!

225
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,308
There's no reason you can't beat
a guy like that!

226
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:58,484
As your partner,
I swear I'll make you win!

227
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,729
Because I'll…

228
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,633
I'll always stand by you
no matter what happens!

229
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,372
Let's win this for sure.
Since we're the ultimate duo.

230
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,175
You want me to drive?

231
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,977
It's okay.

232
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,549
To work harder from here, we need to eat.

233
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,485
Mr. Yamaoka,
your testimony is our only hope!

234
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,653
I beg of you please!

235
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,489
Ryo, I fail as your partner.

236
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,646
Shut up!

237
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,816
He is the best partner I could ask for.

238
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:10,856
I'm sorry too.

239
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,635
I won't say it anymore.

240
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,775
I won't say that
I fail as your partner anymore.

241
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,013
All right.

242
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,421
I won't say that
I can't beat him anymore either.

243
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,127
That guy…

244
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:36,375
That was a kiss
promising the trial's victory.

245
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,210
Or so we thought.

246
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,282
You liked me that much?

247
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,683
Haru's past?

248
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,288
Either you cut ties with that partner
at once or you quit our firm.

249
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,255
Haruto!

250
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,957
