1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,639
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,775
- Be careful.
- Okay.

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:16,383
There's an easy way to check
if you're in love or not.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,452
If you see that person together
with someone else

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,622
and you get jealous or not.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,426
I can't… deny it any longer.

7
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:28,928
I've fallen…

8
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,768
in love.

9
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,480
I have no memory of how I got home.

10
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,984
I'm home.

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,492
What's wrong? Why were the lights off?

12
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,366
You came home quite late.

13
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:13,306
Ms. Maiko was really drunk,
so I had no choice but to take her home.

14
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,943
It's late for just having dropped her off!

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,844
Huh?

16
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,580
I went to drink alone afterward.

17
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,016
Is that true?

18
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,151
Yeah, it's true.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,791
Wait, what's wrong?

20
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,929
Don't tell me you're jealous?

21
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,067
If that's true, I'd be really happy.

22
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,336
No…

23
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,839
I'm…

24
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,713
I won't cheat.

25
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,317
Because my heart belongs to you.

26
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,827
So, about my investigation report…

27
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,870
I don't care
about the investigation report.

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,474
No, what the heck am I thinking?

29
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:31,818
In short, Maiko Suzusaka was blackmailing
the R&D manager, Takashi Mizusaki,

30
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,788
who was receiving money from the company
he was leaking information to.

31
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,190
Yes.

32
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,392
Looks like they both got terminated.

33
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,860
They got what they deserved.

34
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,229
Shiba, you did well.

35
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,331
Thank you, sir.

36
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,635
Let's get right into the next case.

37
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,272
This client is managed
by our New York office,

38
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,440
a Japanese automotive parts manufacturer.

39
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,943
The prospects are grim though.

40
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,812
Of course I'll accept it.

41
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,218
If you succeed with this case,
your name will spread across New York.

42
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,321
However, there isn't much time.

43
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,991
We need you to show results within a week.

44
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,804
One week should be enough.

45
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,143
No, a week won't be nearly enough.

46
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,750
I won't cheat.

47
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,889
PARTNER
RYOMA SHIBA

48
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,225
Because my heart belongs to you.

49
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,130
No!

50
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:56,069
When I think about him,
I can't focus on work.

51
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,006
Are you okay? Can I come in?

52
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,308
Yes.

53
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,845
I heard you accepted
the automotive parts manufacturer case.

54
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,849
If you can win this,
it'll be a big leap forward for you.

55
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,852
And you'll be closer to becoming
the Guardian of the Law.

56
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,991
Both work and love are smooth sailing, eh?

57
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,660
Love?

58
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:21,561
Yeah.

59
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,198
What on earth are you talking about?

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,135
Isn't love…

61
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,639
the very best…

62
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,973
MEGAVITA E

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,675
…energy drink?

64
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,156
Ryo!

65
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,557
Ryo!

66
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,793
Ryo!

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,762
Ryo!

68
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,796
Hey, Ryo!

69
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,364
Ryo!

70
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,199
- Ryo.
- This can't go on…

71
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,138
I can't stay this way.

72
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,608
Ryo?

73
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,850
Love is not an energy drink.

74
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,454
It's an obstruction, it's evil!

75
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,025
To become the Guardian of the Law…

76
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,761
I must…

77
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,266
quit being in love.

78
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,570
Ryo, what time are you coming home today?

79
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,275
Hmm?

80
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,744
Acqua Pazza!

81
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,514
Nice, Themis! Good idea!

82
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,116
I won't be home due to a new case.

83
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,017
What?

84
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,754
Ryo said he wasn't coming home.

85
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,129
Is there anything I can help with?

86
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,101
NO

87
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,806
I bottled up my feelings for Haruto
and drowned myself in work.

88
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,390
CORPORATE LAW DEPARTMENT
REPRESENTATIVE PARTNER

89
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,059
I drowned in work.

90
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,929
Drowned in work.

91
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,365
And drowned.

92
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,773
Ryo.

93
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,775
Ryo!

94
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,253
Are you okay, Ryo?

95
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:13,359
Am I so in love
that I'm hallucinating now?

96
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,395
Your skin's really breaking out.

97
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,031
You've been pulling all-nighters.

98
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,566
It's his scent.

99
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,171
This isn't a hallucination!

100
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,839
W-Why did you come?!

101
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,974
What?

102
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,343
I brought you food and clothes.

103
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,112
Since eating only protein bars
will be harmful to your body.

104
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,518
You're the harmful one.

105
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,787
When I think about you,

106
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,525
my brain goes numb as if a poison
had spread through my body.

107
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,200
Ryo. Here, eat this.

108
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,412
Here we go.

109
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,285
Here. Say "ah."

110
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,659
Then love is a poison after all?

111
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,370
How is it?

112
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,478
The citric acid in those pickled plums
will help your tired body recover.

113
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,882
You like that kind
of logical stuff, don't you?

114
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,854
It's good.

115
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,159
I'm glad.

116
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:02,868
I'm sure I will never forget the taste
of the rice ball I ate that day.

117
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,782
Hang in there, Ryo.

118
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,329
After finishing Haruto's food,

119
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,165
the path to victory
suddenly came into view.

120
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,137
All right.

121
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:49,115
Is love the very best
energy drink after all?

122
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,986
So you're one step away from victory?

123
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,121
No.

124
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,489
Hmm?

125
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:01,594
To secure a comeback win for this case,
the current plan isn't enough.

126
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,699
That thoroughness of yours
is your strong point.

127
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,503
When I watch you, you remind me of him.

128
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,072
Him?

129
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,075
He started at the same time as me.

130
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,277
He was just undefeatable.

131
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,983
Everybody expected him
to become a world-famous lawyer.

132
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,485
What is that person doing now?

133
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,758
He fell for a terrible woman and
lost his status and reputation.

134
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,828
After losing everything he disappeared.

135
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,831
He was such a highly competent man,

136
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:45,137
but he was head over heels in love
and it got the best of him.

137
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,973
What a foolish man.

138
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,746
Hmm?

139
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:54,814
What's the matter?

140
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,651
Please excuse me for today.

141
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,685
What?

142
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,661
I'm the foolish one!

143
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,131
This is no time
to be head over heels in love!

144
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,033
Besides…

145
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,368
It's those real estate scammers.

146
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:24,477
If people find out that my partner
is a fraud, I'll lose everything.

147
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,382
Have I lost my sense of judgment
due to love?

148
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,420
I knew that love was
just an obstruction to me.

149
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,522
It's a poison.

150
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,963
But anyway, what is this?

151
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,831
It feels like…

152
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,737
my body's burning up as if a poison
were spreading throughout my body.

153
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,079
Ryo, are you okay? Ryo!

154
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,631
Ryo, don't get up yet!

155
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,136
Please, just rest in bed.

156
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,639
But I still have work left--

157
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,274
It's all done.

158
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,210
What?

159
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,245
Wait one second.

160
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,248
Here.

161
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,890
All of my unfinished work
is neatly organized.

162
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,326
How did you…

163
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,929
I read and studied all
of those books there.

164
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,063
All of them?

165
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,866
Yeah, all of them.

166
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,439
Laws are amazing.

167
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:07,012
The law exists to protect
the weak people in society.

168
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,382
It made me want to study more and more.

169
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,258
You know, I've been through many jobs,

170
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,862
but this is by far the most fun one.

171
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,633
That's why I want to study more and more,

172
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:33,272
become your greatest partner,
and help all kinds of people.

173
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,084
Anyhow, just rest for now.

174
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,890
Here.

175
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,758
Don't give me that nonsense.

176
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,628
What?

177
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,732
You want to help all kinds of people?

178
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,837
You're someone
who only thinks about yourself.

179
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,442
You're from the underground world.

180
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,050
You're a fraud.

181
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,499
Ryo…

182
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,505
Since when did you know?

183
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,574
Just leave my place at once.

184
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,348
Right.

185
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,285
I'll cause trouble if I'm here.

186
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,502
Thanks for everything up to now, Ryo.

187
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,694
Hey, Ryo.

188
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,631
To be honest,

189
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:45,371
I only thought of you
as a good person to tease.

190
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,274
What?!

191
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,176
How cute.

192
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,611
Don't tease me.

193
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,414
Maybe I should upload this.

194
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:58,951
But now…

195
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,039
I'm so stupid.

196
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,142
I'm a fraud.

197
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,380
I can't believe I seriously fell in love.

198
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,801
Haru!

199
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,335
Haru!

200
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,236
Haru!

201
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,905
Yo, how were you guys?

202
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,373
Hey, wassup?

203
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,675
Here, allowance.

204
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,813
What?

205
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,148
This much? You sure?

206
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,216
Yeah.

207
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,052
Since I'll be making good money soon.

208
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,089
Why's that, Haru?

209
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,929
I'm going back to where I came from.

210
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,065
What?

211
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,566
That's right.

212
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,736
I'm from the underground world,

213
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,374
I'm not worthy of Ryo,
who lives on the surface.

214
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,880
Goodbye, Ryo.

215
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,130
I hear you've got a good job?

216
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,682
This was the right decision.

217
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,317
Where are you now, Haruto?

218
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,418
Ryo!

219
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,886
That's not where you belong.

220
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,289
Ryo, you know you can't leave me.

221
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,890
