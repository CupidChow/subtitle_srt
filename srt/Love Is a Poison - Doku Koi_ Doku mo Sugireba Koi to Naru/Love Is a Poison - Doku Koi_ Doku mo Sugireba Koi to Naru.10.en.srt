1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,907
The client is an independent
investment bank, Anemone Capital.

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,011
A company led by Takayasu Arisuinbo,

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:15,115
Nishiki Resort Development,
is taken to court for their illegal acts

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,485
after Anemone filed a lawsuit
for 20.5 billion yen in damages.

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,286
Please!

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,157
Mr. Yamaoka,
your testimony is our only hope!

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,493
I'll be a witness.

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,429
Mr. Yamaoka, that sounds different
from what you mentioned before.

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,365
No, this is the truth.

10
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,001
…due to Nishiki Resort Development's
wrongful pressure.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:39,506
No, there were no such acts whatsoever.

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,608
No way.

13
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,413
I can't beat Hachisuka after all.

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,914
Of course you can beat him!

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,852
As your partner,
I swear I'll make you win!

16
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,928
Here's some coffee.

17
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,229
- Thanks.
- Sure.

18
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,131
There we go.

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,074
I'm sure you know already,
but as it stands we can't beat Arisuinbo.

20
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:15,442
Yeah.

21
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,278
What should we do first in order to win?

22
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:23,683
We must uncover who this Kiita City
Nature Conservation Association is.

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,185
KIITA CITY NATURE CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION

24
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:30,023
There's a big possibility Arisuinbo is
pulling the strings behind this group.

25
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,428
Arisuinbo…

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,669
Arisuinbo manipulated the local group
and put a big dent in Anemone's project.

27
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:47,607
Which led directly to NISHITO
Construction's contract cancellation.

28
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,209
I'll make that clear in court.

29
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,077
Yeah.

30
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,647
But we don't have
any concrete evidence right now.

31
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:59,352
For us to win, we need evidence.

32
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,723
Got it. Leave it to me.

33
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,463
But I don't think they'll give
themselves away that easily.

34
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,233
Don't worry, just trust me.

35
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,703
After all, I can become anyone I want.

36
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,037
Right?

37
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,144
You look so glum!

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,212
Hey, do you trust me? Hey!

39
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,113
Yeah.

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,324
We're completely at a disadvantage.

41
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,726
But…

42
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,127
Watch out!

43
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,532
As I watched Haruto smile,
I felt we could win.

44
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,701
That's what I thought.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,072
ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT
ENVIRONMENT POLICY DIVISION

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,244
You're a college student?

47
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:03,583
Yes. I need to write a report
on environmental protection for my class.

48
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,085
Is that so?

49
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,220
But…

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,358
It's about this.

51
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,660
FIGHT RESORT CONSTRUCTION

52
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,396
The Kiita City
Nature Conservation Association.

53
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,932
I'd like to ask about this incident.

54
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,100
I see.

55
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,537
Thank you so much. I've learned a lot.

56
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,572
Come again anytime.

57
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,706
Thank you so much.

58
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,247
Yup, I must be the best partner
you could ask for, Ryo.

59
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,090
Excuse me.

60
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,795
Sir, did you call me?

61
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,602
This arrived anonymously.

62
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,690
"Ryoma Shiba's partner is a criminal,

63
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,159
and borderline illegal
investigations are being done."

64
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:26,132
That envelope was sent
to everyone in the office.

65
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:35,341
Is that the reason why you kept
your 100th partner's identity a secret?

66
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:42,282
If you were using a criminal
to illegally obtain evidence…

67
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,686
that would be a serious
Attorney Act violation.

68
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,192
Yes.

69
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,831
If that's true, then you are left
with only two choices.

70
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,702
And they are?

71
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,776
Either you cut ties
with that partner at once…

72
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,015
or you quit our firm.

73
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,483
I know.

74
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,286
I know what's most important to me.

75
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,791
I've waited all my life to beat this man.

76
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm home.

77
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,336
Welcome home.

78
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,739
Did something happen again?

79
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,911
Tell me.

80
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,648
Ryo?

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,389
RYOMA SHIBA'S PARTNER IS A CRIMINAL

82
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,192
AND BORDERLINE ILLEGAL
INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING DONE

83
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,097
Who on earth did this?

84
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,737
Could it be that one lawyer, Hachisuka?

85
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:22,642
Making your boyfriend your work assistant?

86
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,077
Most likely.

87
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:35,421
I was told by my director
that I'm left with two choices.

88
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:41,627
Either I cut ties with you
or I leave the firm.

89
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,907
You made sure to tell him
that you'd cut ties with me, right?

90
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,883
I…

91
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,286
don't intend on cutting ties with you.

92
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,128
Stupid.

93
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,165
Ryo, you're stupid to do that!

94
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,968
You're gonna become
the Guardian of the Law!

95
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,338
What are you doing going off track
at a time like this?!

96
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,842
Why?

97
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,913
You can always find another partner!

98
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,082
No one can replace you!

99
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,451
There is no one else.

100
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:50,296
In my life, winning in court
was everything to me.

101
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,466
Everything else didn't mean a thing to me.

102
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,968
But I've…

103
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,005
I've changed after meeting you.

104
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,246
When I wake up in the morning
and I see you sleeping next to me,

105
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,315
I feel like the happiest man in the world.

106
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,688
When I go to work, I always get worried.

107
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:22,728
I get worried that you
might disappear while I'm gone.

108
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,434
I think about you, Haruto,

109
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:34,373
every second of every minute of every day.

110
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,847
There's no way I can leave you!

111
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,755
Ryo.

112
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,645
You liked me that much?

113
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,983
Ryo, you idiot.

114
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,456
Of course I do!

115
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,860
Then gimme a kiss.

116
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,468
Tsk.

117
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,546
Will you… s-stay by my side always?

118
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,159
Fine then.

119
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:03,996
I'll stay.

120
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:30,589
Is that the reason why you kept
your 100th partner's identity a secret?

121
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,794
Even if I wanted
to hide Haruto's identity,

122
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,230
I don't know anything about him.

123
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,141
Haruto?

124
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,977
Mom.

125
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,418
To be honest, I was afraid to know.

126
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,388
But…

127
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,495
I want to know everything about Haruto.

128
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,865
No, I could never! No way.

129
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,101
I can't eat bugs.

130
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,769
Oh, it's Mr. Ryo.

131
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,305
- What? Mr. Ryo!
- Mr. Ryo!

132
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,339
I got a snack.

133
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,843
- What?! Wow!
- Thank you!

134
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,079
Definitely strawberry!

135
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,247
No, chocolate's best!

136
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,715
- It looks so good!
- Chocolate!

137
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,016
I want this one!

138
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,185
Looks so good! Oh my gosh!

139
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,923
Thanks, Mr. Ryo.

140
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:39,892
It's nothing.

141
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,697
Hey, Mr. Ryo…
did you need something from me?

142
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,271
If there's anything you know,
I want you to tell me.

143
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,440
About Haruto's past.

144
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,409
Haru's past?

145
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,411
Yeah.

146
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,480
I don't know.

147
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,250
We both don't talk
about that kind of stuff.

148
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,887
And everyone comes here
after ditching their past.

149
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,628
Oh yeah, maybe she'll know something.

150
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,897
She?

151
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,015
Mr. Shiba, I'm closing up soon.

152
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,191
It's about Haruto…

153
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,560
Haruto?

154
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,899
If there's anything you know about him,
I'd like you to tell me.

155
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:05,544
Do you know of the scar
he has on his side?

156
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,420
He sometimes gets restless
and cries in his sleep.

157
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,990
He whispers, "Mom."

158
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,232
Haruto never talks about it.

159
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,035
But still…

160
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,772
I still want to know.

161
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,310
Because I love Haruto.

162
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,883
Because it's the person I love's past.

163
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,858
2019

164
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,834
What are you doing there?

165
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,504
Hurry up and go home.

166
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,844
I don't have a home.

167
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,412
What?

168
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,351
He looked like he'd die
if I didn't take him in,

169
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,854
so I told him he could sleep here.

170
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:27,326
He was suspicious of me at first,
so he didn't speak to me at all.

171
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,229
But he gradually opened up to me,

172
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,600
so he told me about that scar on his side.

173
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,073
Oh, hey! Can you get that please?

174
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,541
Okay.

175
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,215
What happened there?

176
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,350
Hmm?

177
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,518
Oh, this?

178
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,620
This is…

179
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,123
an honorable scar.

180
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,892
An honorable scar?

181
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,160
Yeah.

182
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,664
Hey, if that's from winning a street
fight, that's not honorable, okay?

183
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,865
No, it isn't.

184
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,169
It's from protecting my mom
from some bad guys.

185
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,104
Wait, "my mom"?

186
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,174
So you do have a home!

187
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,842
My mom's gone now.

188
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,876
Hmm?

189
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,413
She died.

190
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,719
I couldn't protect my mom in the end.

191
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,492
After that…

192
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,064
Haruto told me about his mom too.

193
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:48,140
Haruto's mom was this one man's mistress.

194
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,711
Haruto's dad is…

195
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,988
the boss of Arisu Group,
Takayasu Arisuinbo.

196
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:27,012
TAKAYASU ARISUINBO

197
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,161
Let's win this for sure.
Since we're the ultimate duo.

198
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:51,170
That means I've dragged Haruto
into a battle against his real dad!

199
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,407
Haruto!

200
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,686
I'M GOING OUT FOR A BIT
I'VE MEAL PREPPED, MAKE SURE TO EAT

201
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,950
If I break up with him,
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

202
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,553
- I thought you might hate me.
- Don't be stupid!

203
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,422
You are my precious boyfriend.

204
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,957
