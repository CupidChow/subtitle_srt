1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,612
Come on, Ryo. It's morning, get up.

2
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,184
I don't wanna.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,853
Hmm?

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,389
You can't.

5
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,258
If you don't get to the office,
you'll get fired.

6
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,162
Then I'll get fired.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,866
You can't!

8
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:33,833
Hmm?

9
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,504
Because I love seeing you stand in court.

10
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,440
When you're in court, Ryo,

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,577
you're super handsome and super sexy.

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,116
It gave me goosebumps watching you.

13
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,553
You…

14
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,261
You were checking me out the whole time?

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,397
Is that bad?

16
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,567
Bad?

17
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,472
Of course not.

18
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,576
You're gonna be late!

19
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,311
Then I'll be late.

20
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,047
No! "I'll be late," my butt! You can't be!

21
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,382
- Not yet.
- Come on!

22
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,050
You don't wanna stay with me?

23
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,318
I do!

24
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,253
That's enough, lovebirds.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,388
Why?

26
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,491
Sir, did you call for me?

27
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,296
There can be only one reason
for me to call you here.

28
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,733
Shoot, have I been too elated
that I've lost my grip?

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,735
I apologize. I will focus going forward.

30
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,306
I'm considering promoting you
to a managing partner.

31
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,243
Is that true, sir?

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,211
Yes.

33
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,512
Eventually,

34
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:57,851
I'd like you to lead the office
together with me.

35
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,619
Think about it for me.

36
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:05,458
This means the day I become
the Guardian of the Law is drawing near.

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,162
By the way, Shiba, I have this.

38
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,897
Yes.

39
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,603
Kuromatsu Trading?

40
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,006
Looks like they're having a big
celebration for their 50th anniversary.

41
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:25,078
But there's no way I can make it,
so I'd like you to go in place of me.

42
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,946
I understand.

43
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,748
I'm counting on you.

44
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,089
You can take one person along,
so bring someone with you.

45
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,228
*YOU MAY INVITE ONE GUEST TO ACCOMPANY YOU

46
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:39,953
What?

47
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,387
A party?

48
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,722
I'm going!

49
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,124
I'm definitely going!
I wanna go! Lemme see!

50
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,093
It's not gonna be that fun.

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,230
But these types of hotels
must have really good food, right?!

52
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,631
Like meat, meat, and meat?

53
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,368
Well, they will, but…

54
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,540
Oh, right.

55
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,510
This is you-know-what, huh?

56
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,048
Um, the type of events you go to
with your wife or an important partner.

57
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,919
I will allow you to stay
at this house temporarily.

58
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,687
However, you must follow these.

59
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,588
TEN AGREEMENTS

60
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,992
I got overexcited, sorry.

61
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,595
What are you saying?

62
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,997
THE SHIBA HOUSE'S TEN AGREEMENTS

63
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,867
You are an important partner to me.

64
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:30,903
Ryo.

65
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,206
Don't make me state the obvious.

66
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,149
Haruto.

67
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,456
Whoa!

68
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,960
- Let's do it.
- Huh?

69
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,261
I wanna do it.

70
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,629
We haven't had dinner yet.

71
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,731
Ryo, you're my appetizer.

72
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,166
Hey!

73
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,201
I'm just kidding.

74
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,538
You're my main dish.

75
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,494
By the way, you don't have a suit, huh?
Like one you wear to formal settings.

76
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,296
No, I don't.

77
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,333
The one I used as a disguise,
I gave away to Yu and them.

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,668
Then let's use this chance to tailor one.

79
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,203
Hmm?

80
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,440
But aren't custom-tailored suits
pretty expensive?

81
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,375
Don't worry.

82
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,114
If you're going to stand beside me,
you'll have to dress appropriately.

83
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,688
Then excuse me.
I'll start with your chest.

84
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,028
How do I look?

85
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,234
Hey, Ryo.

86
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,572
There's a good Chinese restaurant nearby.
You wanna go eat there after this?

87
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,609
How about this one?

88
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,017
Looks great on you.

89
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,721
Ryo?

90
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,257
Okay, accessories next.

91
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,158
Hmm?

92
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,862
Shoes, a watch,
and you need a briefcase too.

93
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,930
I don't think I need a briefcase.

94
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,934
KUROMATSU TRADING
50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

95
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,833
Thanks for waiting, Ryo.

96
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,437
Yeah. You're late.

97
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,440
What a really nice venue.

98
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,842
Looks like
they'll have lots of tasty food.

99
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,021
- Who's that?
- What a stylish guy.

100
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,860
He's so hot!

101
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,609
Hey, Ryo, everyone's all looking at me.

102
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,611
Do I look weird?

103
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,446
No.

104
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,515
Not at all.

105
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,650
Really?

106
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:06,919
Glad to hear that.

107
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,888
Then I'll go get some drinks.

108
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,327
Oh, is that champagne?

109
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,095
Yes.

110
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,332
Look. Look all you want.

111
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,573
But Haruto is mine.

112
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,045
Oh, Attorney Shiba.

113
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,115
Long time no see, Mr. Tominari.

114
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,483
Long time no see.

115
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,255
Oh, where's Attorney Iwamine?

116
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,024
Iwamine could not make it,
so I've come in his place.

117
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,326
Oh, is that so?

118
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,999
This man is one of the nation's most
famous tech firm's CEO,

119
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,368
but I hear he keeps a number of lovers.

120
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,604
To be honest,
I don't want to get involved with him.

121
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,006
No, that's saying too much.

122
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,841
Ryo, which do you want?

123
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,377
And he is?

124
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,214
My assistant.

125
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,584
Hello.

126
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,618
Hmm?

127
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,956
Attorney Shiba,

128
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,692
why did you choose this guy
as your assistant?

129
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,460
What?

130
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,998
This guy is the type of man
who wanders around the city at night

131
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:30,870
looking for rich people
to freeload off of.

132
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,306
He's a piece of trash!

133
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,141
A scumbag!

134
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,978
You should cut ties with him immediately!

135
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,618
I'll get going.

136
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,926
Please take back what you just said.

137
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,962
Say what?

138
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,931
A-Are you saying
you side with this scumbag?!

139
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,066
He…

140
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,902
is my boyfriend.

141
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,138
B-Boyfriend?

142
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,777
Please apologize to my boyfriend.

143
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,183
Your statement is something
that violates his human rights.

144
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,919
Have you heard of the crime of defamation?

145
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,088
Defamation?

146
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,225
If you slander another person in public,
you can be punished by law.

147
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,294
You face imprisonment up to a year,
penal detention,

148
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,563
a fine of up to 300,000 yen,
detainment, or a petty fine.

149
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,032
If he files a lawsuit against you…

150
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,504
I will spare no effort to crush you.

151
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,875
Ryo.

152
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,878
Fine.

153
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,282
I-I just have to apologize, right?
I'll apologize!

154
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,553
My bad!

155
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,758
Then please excuse us.

156
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,178
- Here you are!
- Thanks.

157
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,346
Enjoy!

158
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,847
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the food.

159
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,426
Haruto, you liked omurice, didn't you?

160
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,094
It has lots of chicken in it.

161
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,495
Yeah.

162
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,166
Thank you for the food.

163
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,176
Yeah, it's good.

164
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,211
Good to hear!

165
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,122
Hey, Ryo.

166
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,090
Hmm?

167
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,158
About that man from earlier…

168
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,597
All he said was nonsense.

169
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,436
That guy, when I was drinking in the city,

170
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,272
he came up and tried to buy me.

171
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,344
Seems like he likes both men and women.

172
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,947
He probably thought
I'd sell myself if he paid me enough.

173
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,651
But I refused,
so I guess it hurt his pride.

174
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,289
Wait, what's wrong?!

175
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,626
I won't forgive him.

176
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,161
What? Stop.

177
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,029
Let go!

178
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,632
But Ryo, you're weak.

179
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,436
Hey!

180
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,471
Okay?

181
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,307
See.

182
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,150
That was enough back there.

183
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,520
It could've affected your promotion,

184
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,257
but you defended me
and said that I was your boyfriend.

185
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,361
That made me really happy.

186
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,073
Oh!

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,477
Sorry. I spilled on myself
when you just bought me this!

188
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,845
Oh, my!

189
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,848
Don't worry.
We can always get another suit.

190
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,016
Here, use this.

191
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,184
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

192
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,720
Ryo.

193
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,688
Hmm?

194
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,992
Sorry I ruined the party today.

195
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,195
No.

196
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:55,000
Haruto, more than some fancy party,

197
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,470
I'm fine as long as I have you beside me.

198
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,076
Shiba…

199
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,448
it's difficult to say this.

200
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,985
A-Are you saying
you side with this scumbag?!

201
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,019
He…

202
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,888
is my boyfriend.

203
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:21,227
Was it too careless of me
to bring Haruto along after all?

204
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:25,331
I'd like for you to lend me a hand
in a certain case.

205
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,366
A case?

206
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,905
The client is called Anemone Capital.
You've heard of them.

207
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,474
Yes.

208
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,912
They're an independent investment bank
that's recently growing rapidly.

209
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:45,584
Lately, they are aggressively branching
out into the real estate business.

210
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,155
These are the materials
on the development project

211
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,193
for a large entertainment facility
they've been working on for three years.

212
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,164
I heard the start of the construction was
delayed, but was there a problem?

213
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,500
Despite the fact
that the general contractor,

214
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,437
Nishito Construction, signed a contract,

215
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,641
they've canceled it
without any discussion.

216
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,011
What's happened?

217
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,853
Well, it seems like
Nishito Construction was pressured

218
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:28,160
by the leisure industry's largest company,
Nishiki Resort Development.

219
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,297
Nishiki Resort Development?

220
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,197
Yes.

221
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,035
It's a group company
of Takayasu Arisuinbo,

222
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,338
the political and business world's fixer.

223
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,778
He will likely be their lawyer.

224
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,784
I recommended you because I thought
you could handle it, but I'm disappointed.

225
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,322
What do you want to do…

226
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,758
Shiba?

227
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,268
Are you still…

228
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,607
No…

229
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,778
I will accept it.

230
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,050
TAKAYASU ARISUINBO

231
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,921
I'm home!

232
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,090
You're early today.

233
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,995
Welcome home.

234
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,630
What's for dinner tonight?

235
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,334
Ryo.

236
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,470
Yes?

237
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:46,872
Did something happen?

238
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,807
Huh?

239
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,542
I can tell even if you hide it.

240
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,280
Ryo, I'm your best partner, right?

241
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,184
Then tell me.

242
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:11,430
This is the only man
I've ever lost to in court.

243
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,300
What?

244
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:22,374
That trial was handled by my senior,
Attorney Hachisuka.

245
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,781
Hachisuka was our
ace attorney reigning over the office.

246
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,516
I looked up to him.

247
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,418
Shiba.

248
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,424
I recommended you because I thought
you could handle it, but I'm disappointed.

249
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,362
I was stupid
for overestimating your abilities.

250
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,336
I blamed myself for not being able
to live up to his expectations.

251
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,005
However…

252
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,442
There was another reason why I lost.

253
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,410
Oh.

254
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,344
I apologize.

255
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,284
Hachisuka was connected to Arisuinbo
who was the defendant in that trial.

256
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:14,193
He had been leaking all of my trial
strategies that I worked on to Arisuinbo.

257
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,363
I…

258
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,334
was set up.

259
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:31,210
Soon after, Hachisuka quit the office,
and became Arisuinbo's legal advisor.

260
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,112
This trial,

261
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,082
Hachisuka will fight as
the defense attorney for Arisuinbo's side.

262
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,285
I…

263
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,423
want to win against them this time.

264
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,457
I wanna win.

265
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,196
I wanna win too.

266
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,336
They did something messed up
to you. We can't let them go.

267
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,077
All right, let's get some food
in our systems first.

268
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,685
I did not notice at that moment…

269
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,092
That underneath Haruto's smile
was a heart burning for revenge.

270
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,001
Mom!

271
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,548
Let's win this for sure.

272
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,283
Since we're the ultimate duo.

273
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,585
It's strange to have so few leads.

274
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,189
As your partner,
I swear I'll make you win!

275
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,957
