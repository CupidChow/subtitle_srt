00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,051
The plaintiff's claim has been dismissed.

3
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,358
Shiba, you did it!

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,995
That was excellent, Shiba.

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,232
I've learned so many things
from working with you on this case.

6
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,200
You've learned?

7
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,402
Yes.

8
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,771
I see. Leave this place at once.

9
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:38,671
Yes.

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,006
What?

11
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:44,144
If you're still a novice in training,
you're not worthy of being my partner.

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,547
Oh, jeez.

I, Ryoma Shiba, passed
the bar exam with the highest score

while attending Tokyo University.

My home is based
in Shibuya's redevelopment area.

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,731
After entering one of Japan's leading
law firms, Oraculum Law Office,

18
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:10,170
I became a partner at 27 years old due
to the number of complex cases I've won.

19
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:15,942
My goal is to establish a brand
within the legal world called Ryoma Shiba.

PARTNER
RYOMA SHIBA

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,113
I strive to become
the Guardian of the Law every day.

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,018
This is the story of
the lone-wolf lawyer Ryoma Shiba.

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,720
A serious legal drama
that depicts his journey.

24
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,191
Or maybe not.

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,627
Ryo, you know you can't leave me.

26
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,865
This story's about me, a genius lawyer,

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,702
who gets toyed around
by this mysterious, addictive puppy.

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,372
It is a legal drama and romantic thriller.

29
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,199
Congrats on your comeback win.

30
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,339
My colleague Kotaro Kazama is someone
uninterested in the race for success,

31
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,975
a human rights lawyer
who sticks to his own beliefs.

32
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,112
In short, he lives
in a different world than me.

33
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:04,417
But Kazama is the next most
proficient man after me at Oraculum.

34
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,887
These kinds of people tend
to come in handy when the time comes.

35
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,123
Oh, Saki.

36
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,159
Do you wanna see my new lover?

37
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,160
Yes, I do!

38
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,698
Oh! He's hot!

39
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,066
Isn't he?

40
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,936
Yes, he's gay.

41
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:27,540
But I don't care about
other people's sexual preferences.

42
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,748
By the way,
that was your 99th victim this time, huh?

43
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,551
Leave this place at once.

44
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,721
Are you counting on purpose?

45
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,191
You do know
what everyone calls you, right?

46
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,796
I see, so I'm finally
being called by that name.

47
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,999
The one who carries
the future of the legal world,

48
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,834
the Guardian of the Law.

49
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,138
The cold and merciless
Ice King of the Law, right?

50
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:09,716
We live in a sensitive world these days,
one of these days, you're gonna get sued.

51
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,686
I just need results.

52
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,124
That's all.

53
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,942
I can't send any more sacrifices to you.

54
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,112
The 100th one,

55
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,816
you can find on your own,
someone who you'll be satisfied with.

56
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,721
There's plenty out there.

Even without a 100th partner, I can manage
all the cases I currently have by myself.

64
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,518
Why? Because I am the Guardian of the Law,

65
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,786
Ryoma Shiba!

66
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,021
Ouch!

67
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,390
I apologize.

68
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,660
Hmm?

69
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,962
I'm bleeding.

70
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,667
T-This is a hundred percent my fault.

71
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,638
I can't believe myself, what a screw-up!

72
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,575
Now, in order to get out of this mess…

73
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,713
This is for you. Please use it.

74
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,782
What?

75
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,285
I can have it?

76
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,654
This is Hermis, right?

77
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,457
You sure?

78
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,792
Of course.

79
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,203
When people find they can benefit
from the other, they won't attack them.

80
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:14,073
Humans are such foolish
and ridiculous creatures.

81
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,079
What is it?

82
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,515
Um…

83
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,785
Yes?

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,088
You're real kind.

85
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,265
Thanks, Mister.

86
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,200
Felix.

87
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,005
Jeez, you were that thirsty?

88
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,850
You look so dirty.

89
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,955
Themis, I'll clean you if you stay put.

90
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,396
There is no such thing
as romance in my life.

91
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,499
But there are times I want stress relief.

92
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,937
That's where these little guys come in.

93
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,281
Here's a special massage.

94
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,917
How is it, Roy?

95
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,652
Doesn't it feel good?

96
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,288
When I'm doing this,

97
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,092
I can hear the voices of my succulents.

98
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,196
Is that so?

99
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,667
You're happy to be with me?

100
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,271
Thanks, Mister.

101
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,243
Why did that guy's voice just…

102
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,212
Hmm?

103
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,748
Hey, don't be stupid.

104
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,750
There's no way I'm interested in him.

105
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,685
You're real kind.

106
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,329
My mind has been corrupted.

107
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,032
This calls for…

108
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,714
I make time to calm my soul
and empty my mind.

109
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:14,153
This time is necessary for me
to become the Guardian of the Law.

110
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,526
Why?

111
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,824
Meat eaten in the wild is delicious,

112
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,528
but a protein bar eaten
in the wild is exquisite too.

113
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,664
No way!

114
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,440
So we meet again, Mister.

115
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,112
What is this? An illusion?

116
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,952
What?!

117
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,488
I'm not an illusion.

118
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,460
I was invited by an acquaintance
and I'm visiting a vacation home nearby.

119
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,964
It's a big coincidence
to meet each other again.

120
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,667
Maybe this is destined to be.

121
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,969
Huh? What are you saying?

122
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,504
Your logs are piled weirdly.

123
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,740
You gotta think of the airflow.

124
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,174
Hey, don't touch.

125
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,776
Is this your first time camping?

126
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
No.

127
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,847
Then your second time?

128
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,586
Third time?

129
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,490
Fourth?

130
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,392
Fifth time?

131
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,260
Sixth?

132
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,194
Seventh?

133
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,296
Eighth? Ninth?

134
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,498
Tenth!

135
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,001
Eleventh.

136
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,905
Hmm.

137
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,776
So it's your eleventh time.

138
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,011
I haven't said anything.

139
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,216
Mister, you don't look it,
but you're very awkward.

140
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,620
How cute.

141
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,124
Don't tease me.

142
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,205
Please, have some.

143
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,755
How is it?

144
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,227
As expected of an A5-rank premium meat.
It's good no matter who cooks it.

145
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,463
Right.

146
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,766
No, this is exquisitely grilled.

147
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,603
I've never had such exquisite meat
even at a high-end restaurant.

148
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,207
Who on earth is this guy?

149
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,376
Mister, who are you?

150
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,378
Huh?

151
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,749
There's no way you're
a regular office worker.

152
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,686
Your meat and camping gear
are all top class too.

153
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,057
Can I guess it?

154
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,962
You're a lawyer.

155
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,500
Your badge? It's not on you.

156
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,537
You…

157
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,239
How did I know?

158
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,842
I can read peoples' minds.

159
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,712
Because I'm psychic.

160
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,157
Yes?

161
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,426
Oh, all right. Yes.

162
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,429
I'll come back right away. Yes.

163
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,472
Then I'll see you, Mister.

164
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,775
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

165
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,180
Bye!

166
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,433
This is so good.

167
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,540
I've finally regained some peace.

168
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,743
This is what's great about solo camping.

169
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,679
It's fantastic.

170
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,082
Mister, you don't look it,
but you're very awkward.

171
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,984
How cute.

172
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,253
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

173
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,590
We'll see each other again?

174
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,226
There's no way that would…

175
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,298
You!

176
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,067
Shh! Stay quiet!

177
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,136
Haruto?

178
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,304
Hey!

179
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,206
Haruto!

180
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,078
Um, hello?

181
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,113
Yes.

182
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,982
Pardon me.

183
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,751
Um, have you seen Haruto?

184
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,686
Haruto?

185
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,356
Um, he's a boy wearing white pajamas.

186
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,994
No, I haven't.

187
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,430
Really? I wonder where he went.

188
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,343
Thank you!

189
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,646
Um…

190
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:16,882
Excuse me!

191
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,485
Can I help you?

192
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,489
I think I just smelled Haruto.

193
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,424
What?

194
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,992
Maybe it was just me.

195
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:28,861
Yes.

196
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,864
Pardon me.

197
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,738
Jeez, so persistent.

198
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,776
I feel relieved, I'm sleepy now.

199
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,179
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,281
I'll explain tomorrow, so let me sleep.

201
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,683
No!

202
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,650
It's so warm.

203
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,718
Get out!

204
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,487
Hey, Mister.

205
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,693
Thanks for keeping me hidden.

206
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,230
I knew you were kind.

207
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,908
I must kick him out immediately.

208
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,714
Wait, but I do owe this guy.

209
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,615
Ouch!

210
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,653
I injured him at the bar,
he lit a fire for me,

211
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,089
and he cooked my meat.

212
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,126
Fine then.

213
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,198
It's to repay him.

214
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,143
What?

215
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,278
The car…

216
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,096
I must get back to my normal life
as soon as possible.

217
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,801
I can just buy a new car again.

218
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,437
No, I'm not acting tough about it.

219
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,540
That coffee stain on my seat
was bothering me anyway.

220
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,775
It was time to trade it in.

221
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,648
Hmm?

222
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,754
- I know, hold on--
- Welcome home, Mister.

223
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,561
I've always wanted to ride a luxury car.
It felt nice.

224
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,532
You…

225
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,769
Hey, Mister, let me live here with you.

226
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:26,638
Huh?

227
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,808
And by the way,
I can become your 100th partner too.

228
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,343
How do you know about that?

229
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,878
You mentioned it at the bar.

230
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,747
Oh yeah. Look at what I took.

231
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,223
Maybe I should upload this.

232
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,794
By the way,
I have about 130,000 followers on Xgram.

233
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:53,799
You…

234
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,603
Who on earth are you?

235
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,674
Now who do you think I am?

236
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,046
I was tricked!

237
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,549
The property in the contract didn't exist,

238
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,317
and just my money disappeared!

239
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,524
It was these people!

240
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,614
- Say "ah."
- Stop it!

241
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,882
My housekeeper Haruto.

242
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,218
You want me to look up this case?

243
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,587
Ryo, I'm your 100th partner…

244
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,422
and I'll be your first lover.

245
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,957
