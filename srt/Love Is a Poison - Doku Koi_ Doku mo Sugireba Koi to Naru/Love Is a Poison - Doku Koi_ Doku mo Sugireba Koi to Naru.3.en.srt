1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,840
How about we do this?

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,642
Ryo, I'm your 100th partner…

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,178
and I'll be your first lover.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,961
Just kidding.

5
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,599
Then I'll go fill up the bath!

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,447
What is this?

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,286
Ryo! I'm coming in!

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,492
It smells good.

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,760
What on earth is this?

10
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,464
A rose petal bath has relaxing effects.

11
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,300
And it gives you beautiful skin.

12
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,936
- Beautiful skin?
- Yup.

13
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,440
You stand in front of the public for work,
so appearance is important.

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,309
Now, here I come!

15
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,044
Come?

16
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:28,855
You!

17
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,690
Here I come with skin care!

18
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:36,796
It's beauty specialist Haruto's
special treatment!

19
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,131
Here, close your eyes.

20
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,466
What?

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,201
There we go.

22
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,746
How is it? Nice, huh?

23
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:59,185
As your partner,
I want you to look handsome.

24
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,422
Right.

25
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,358
This guy's my partner.

26
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,528
Just a business partner.

27
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,631
Just a…

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,407
Hey, you'll die that way!

29
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,372
Is today the trial?

30
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,740
Yes.

31
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,446
The one who filed the lawsuit was
the educational influencer, Shitarakku.

32
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,717
The ad agency saw his popularity
and approached Shitarakku

33
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,253
to become their mascot
for a game using virtual currency.

34
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,154
Rakku! Rakku!

35
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,157
Due to it being a rush job,
he agreed to it via verbal promise,

36
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,293
and Shitarakku's name
and photos were used.

37
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,798
But Shitarakku later claimed he refused
the job on the day of their meeting.

38
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,200
He sued one of the companies we advise

39
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,570
Epic Ad Agency
for the infringement of portrait rights.

40
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:02,108
So the point of dispute is
if the verbal promise existed or not.

41
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,345
There are no emails
or documents as evidence.

42
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,948
Ugh, this will be a difficult trial.

43
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,251
Good luck!

44
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,624
It's true that this is a difficult trial.

45
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,661
But I have the path to victory.

46
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,234
I…

47
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,202
SHITARAKKU
TAKUMI SHITARA

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,804
I never promised to be in an ad like that!

49
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:37,610
That's because I thought virtual currency
would be a bad influence on children.

50
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,413
I…

51
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,552
I would never betray all the people
who love my channel.

52
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,122
I would never do that!

53
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,125
- Don't cry!
- Shitarakku, hang in there!

54
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,126
Hang in there!

55
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,460
Order.

56
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:56,896
Order.

57
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,965
Order!

58
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,503
I swear I'll expose that lie of yours.

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,742
What's your relationship
with the plaintiff?

60
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,844
We're business partners.

61
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,881
I'm in charge of the costumes
and makeup for his channel.

62
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,316
BEAUTY INFLUENCER
MITSUKI KIYOSAWA

63
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,886
Now, when he found out that
he was being used for the ad,

64
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,788
what did the plaintiff say to you?

65
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,023
He said it was a surprise,

66
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,593
he was angry that his name and photos
were being used without consent.

67
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,498
Once Mr. Shitara started to be used
in the game ads,

68
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,335
his social media accounts
received major backlash.

69
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,869
Yes.

70
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:41,240
Comments such as, "An educator in
a moneymaking game ad is inappropriate,"

71
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,944
or "I won't watch Shitarakku's channel
anymore," flooded his accounts.

72
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,914
He became mentally unstable due to it.

73
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,952
Then you were also comforting
the mentally unstable Mr. Shitara

74
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,122
even during your private hours?

75
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,824
Huh? What's that mean?

76
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,625
Hey, wait, what does he mean?!

77
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,827
Order.

78
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:03,896
Ms. Kiyosawa.

79
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,935
Do you know that there is a music bar
in Yoyogi called Soralieto?

80
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:16,175
That is a place you
and the plaintiff often visit, is it not?

81
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,644
Yes.

82
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,483
I have here a voice recording
of one of your conversations.

83
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,351
I will play part of it.

84
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,252
What?

85
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,656
I'll be called as a witness,
so I'll make up something.

86
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,659
Takumi, you just have
to pretend like you're mentally ill.

87
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,396
Mitsuki, you seriously have guts.

88
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,564
Oh, stop, you're not one to talk.

89
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,671
But it's easy for you, Takumi,
since you don't have to speak.

90
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,107
The lawyer will do all the work.

91
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,910
Of course, I'm paying them
a ton of money to defend me.

92
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:56,482
But who would've thought
it would blow up this much?

93
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,087
Don't worry,
the trial will be easy as pie.

94
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,491
Oh, rakku rakku, it'll be easy peasy.

95
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,227
Cut it out, stupid!
That's just a character I play.

96
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,263
I still wanna hear it.

97
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,965
Hey Mitsuki, can I come over today?

98
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,635
Hmm, I dunno.

99
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,605
Come on. I want your French toast.

100
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,542
And this French too.

101
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,677
What?

102
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,513
I don't want that French one.

103
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,714
Then what do you want?

104
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,485
I want a passionate Spanish one.

105
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,958
You and Mr. Shitara were
in a romantic relationship, correct?

106
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,698
Yes.

107
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,034
- No way!
- He said he was single.

108
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,269
- I trusted him!
- What a shock!

109
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,804
Order.

110
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,708
Ms. Kiyosawa.

111
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,379
You said, "I'll be called as a witness,
so I'll make up something."

112
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:06,352
So that would mean your testimony
in this court has no credibility then.

113
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,887
Huh? That's…

114
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,190
You said, "Who would've thought
it would blow up this much?"

115
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,428
This means, due to the game ad
receiving unexpected backlash,

116
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,065
you both decided to claim that
the verbal promise never existed, no?

117
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,032
Objection!

118
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,569
Counsel's statement is speculative.

119
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,607
Furthermore, regarding the audio evidence,

120
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,010
I'd like to question
the legality of its source.

121
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,713
Wasn't that a secret audio recording?

122
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,183
It was accidentally recorded by
my acquaintance who visited that bar.

123
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,752
Accidental or not doesn't matter.

124
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,756
Any information from an audio
obtained through illegal means,

125
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,425
cannot be admissible evidence!

126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,632
Audio evidence can only be denied if it
is gained through notably criminal means,

127
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,968
when a person's mental and physical
freedom is withheld from them

128
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,971
violating their personal rights
to collect the evidence.

129
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,342
A conversation recorded
in a publicly open place like a bar

130
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,678
does not fall under that condition.

131
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,687
We will reserve judgment.

132
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,728
It's too early to relax.

133
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,464
This was all within expectations.

134
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,371
So, what are you gonna do now, Shiba?

135
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,909
Your Honor,
I'd like to call in a new witness.

136
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:42,515
Ms. Kamiyama, please state
your relationship with the plaintiff.

137
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,550
SOCIAL MEDIA CONSULTANT
RYOKO KAMIYAMA

138
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,551
Busi…

139
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,853
Business partners.

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,090
I am the consultant
for his streaming channel.

141
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,295
This is Ms. Kamiyama
and the plaintiff's chat records.

142
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,933
The plaintiff tells her that he may be in
the ad for a game using virtual currency.

143
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,402
Furthermore, this is what he sent.

144
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,339
"You can get a bonus
if you use the referral code."

145
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,108
"You can make money
if you start it early."

146
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,345
These messages do not prove
he agreed to be in the ad.

147
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,714
Then let's check the date of the chats.

148
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,450
The messages saying
he may be in the ad are

149
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,586
sent the day before the meeting
with the ad agency.

150
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,758
And the game invite is sent the day
after their meeting on the 9th.

151
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:31,797
Isn't it very strange to recommend
a game that you refused to advertise for?

152
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,635
That's because…

153
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,475
U-Um, it didn't matter
if I was being used in the ad or not.

154
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,412
I just thought the game was interesting,
so I recommended it to Ms. Kamiyama!

155
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:54,286
Then Ms. Kamiyama,
I will ask you once more.

156
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,555
Yes.

157
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,426
Please state your relationship
with the plaintiff.

158
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,696
Business partners.

159
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,434
As well as…

160
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,570
romantic partners.

161
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,772
Huh? What?

162
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,640
Huh?

163
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,009
- What's that mean?
- What's going on?

164
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,784
Let's teach that fake
educational influencer a lesson.

165
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,285
Rakku rakku!

166
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,054
Like I said, don't follow me!

167
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,423
Then how's this?

168
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,999
He has you fooled.

169
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,337
Next.

170
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,273
- What?
- Next.

171
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,845
- Next.
- W-What?

172
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,218
He said he wanted her French toast
and French kisses.

173
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,924
Takumi, you were two-timing me!

174
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,625
No, calm down, Ryoko.

175
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,729
You said you were purely business
with that woman.

176
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,097
That's, um…

177
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,998
Takumi, what's the meaning of this?!

178
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,301
You said that woman was
purely business to me!

179
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,437
- No, um, calm down.
- Hey! I haven't heard about this.

180
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,807
Here! Your Honor!
I take back my testimony from earlier.

181
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,811
Takumi said that he approved
of being used in the game ad!

182
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,815
But since it unexpectedly blew up, he said
he'll act like he never agreed to it!

183
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,151
Your Honor, he said the same to me.

184
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,252
You son of a bitch!

185
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,220
Hey, douchebag!

186
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,688
You asshole!

187
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,992
Order!

188
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,195
You got it wrong!

189
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,731
- Calm down!
- Don't I look calm?!

190
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,565
Hold it, hey!

191
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,001
All a bunch of traitors.

192
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,405
But I won't betray you.

193
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,223
Hey Ryo, gimme a treat.

194
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,127
A treat?

195
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,062
Yeah.

196
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,734
I did a good job, right? So I get a treat.

197
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,869
Treat…

198
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:31,043
Could that p-p-possibly be…

199
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,515
Could it?

200
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,484
Could it be?

201
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,092
Wow!

202
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,294
It sure is pretty!

203
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,264
It feels good!

204
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,666
Doesn't it feel good, Ryo?

205
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,668
Yeah.

206
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,936
Let's set up!

207
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,347
Here we go. Ready, set, go!

208
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,282
- Grab that for me.
- Hmm?

209
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,817
Okay!

210
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,553
I can't do this alone.

211
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,789
Hey, Ryo! Can you hold this?

212
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,559
Thanks.

213
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,530
Hammering now.

214
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,336
Oh, that might be a little dangerous.

215
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,370
Here we go.

216
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,739
Oh, watch out.

217
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,808
Hold it again.

218
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,517
Now, put this one on.

219
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,518
Okay.

220
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,823
Looks good. Here I go.

221
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,498
Good logs sure light up fast.

222
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,071
Hey, Ryo.

223
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,841
Isn't this like yesterday's trial?

224
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,010
What is?

225
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,846
Our awesome teamwork.

226
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,057
Why is our victory celebration camping?

227
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,427
Hmm, before that…

228
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,465
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

229
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,038
So good!

230
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,373
All right, eat up!

231
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,343
This came out really good!

232
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,111
Don't worry, I'll serve.

233
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,515
Here you go.

234
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,884
Here.

235
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,785
Thanks.

236
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,522
Wait, I'll peel the shells.

237
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,523
I'll do it myself.

238
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,158
Just leave it to me.

239
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,398
Here you go.

240
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,268
Oh, the tail…

241
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,937
How is it?

242
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,573
It's edible.

243
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,842
I'm glad.

244
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,746
Knowing him, he'll probably try
to spoon-feed me again.

245
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,148
I'm grilling the meat!

246
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,517
Or not.

247
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,825
Nice!

248
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,596
- Hey.
- 2,000 yen a gram

249
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,064
- Hey!
- Hmm?

250
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,002
What's that?

251
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,307
The official contract for an investigator.

252
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,642
I see.

253
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,916
Yes, this guy is a fraud.

254
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,920
Just so I don't get involved
in any trouble if anything happens,

255
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,355
I must take extra precautio--

256
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,823
Here, I signed it.

257
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:07,993
Did you really read it?

258
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,927
Yeah.

259
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,730
Plus, I completely trust you, Ryo.

260
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,038
The meat's gonna burn! Here, take it!

261
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,305
Crap!

262
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,483
You put it too close to the fire!

263
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,754
Here, gimme it.

264
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,423
Here, eat this one.

265
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,860
This one's gotta go.

266
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,439
It's good.

267
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,507
I'm glad.

268
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:01,146
The outside's crispy, the inside's soft.

269
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,615
This is what you call a roasted ma--

270
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,716
I like you.

271
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,518
Huh?

272
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,656
I really like you, Ryo.

273
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,395
That's why I invited you to go camping.

274
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,898
Because I didn't think
I'd be able to tell you at home.

275
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,001
Your succulents are listening too.

276
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,974
I like your serious face in court,

277
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,643
that slightly awkward side of you,

278
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,581
as well as how you
enjoy eating my cooking too.

279
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,187
I like it all.

280
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,596
EPIC AD AGENCY LAWSUIT REPORT

281
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,797
Still working?

282
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,665
That's tough.

283
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,900
Yeah.

284
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,182
I've seen him somewhere.

285
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,188
I'm serious.

286
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:25,264
What is this feeling?

287
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:31,203
My heart feels like a marshmallow.

288
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:37,576
It's hot, soft, and melting.

289
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,783
There's an easy way to check
if you're in love or not.

290
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,385
And that is?

291
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,053
Then just this time.

292
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,222
What is this pain I feel?

293
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,957
