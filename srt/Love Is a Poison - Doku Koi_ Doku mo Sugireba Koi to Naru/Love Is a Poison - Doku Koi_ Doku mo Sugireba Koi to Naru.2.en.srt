1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,941
I, Ryoma Shiba, am a lone-wolf lawyer
who strives to become

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,510
the Guardian of the Law every day.

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:11,878
Ouch!

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,681
You're real kind.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,216
So we meet again, Mister.

6
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,552
But due to the appearance
of this mystery man,

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,354
I've been thrown off track.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,063
Hey, Mister, let me live here with you.

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:31,898
Huh?

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,968
And by the way,
I can become your 100th partner too.

11
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,070
You…

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,840
Who on earth are you?

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,812
Now who do you think I am?

14
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,824
Don't worry, I didn't see.

15
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,295
But you sure are cute, Ryo.

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,799
Ryo?

17
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,267
I saw your driver's license.

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,436
You're called Ryoma Shiba, right?

19
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,004
That's why you're…

20
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,273
Ryo.

21
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,442
Ryo…

22
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,646
I've never been called that way
by anyone before.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,986
What is this tingly feeling I'm getting?

24
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,188
Hey, Ryo.

25
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,857
These little guys sure are cute.

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,725
- Hey, don't touch them.
- Hmm?

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,762
Oh, my name? I'm Haruto.

28
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,696
Hey!

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,331
Yeah, just talk casually.

30
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,232
What are you doing?

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,667
What? You sure?

32
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,803
What?

33
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,140
He said I can live here with them.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,509
- No, he hasn't.
- Yes, he has.

35
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,144
- He hasn't!
- He has!

36
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,313
Ask him.

37
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,815
Come on.

38
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,984
Here, ask him!

39
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,293
See?

40
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,053
I will allow you to stay
at this house temporarily.

41
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,222
Yes!

42
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,091
I have no choice.

43
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,494
Because…

44
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:23,670
If that ever gets out,
my career as a lawyer is over!

45
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,907
However, you must follow these.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,848
THE SHIBA HOUSE'S TEN AGREEMENTS

47
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,517
The Shiba House's Ten Agreements?

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,555
One, do not bring people over.

49
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,758
Two, do not dirty the rooms.

50
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,328
Three, do not touch my belongings.

51
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,598
Four, do not raise a racket.

52
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,203
Five, do not take long baths.

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,205
Six, do not pile up your laundry.

54
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,374
- Seven, do not--
- Hey, Ryo.

55
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,410
Isn't ten impossible?

56
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,345
DO NOT TALK TO MY PLANTS

57
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,379
It's not impossible.

58
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,048
It is impossible!
I mean, they're this cute!

59
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,852
See?

60
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,022
Like I said, don't…

61
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,328
What's the matter, you guys?

62
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,634
You're glowing more than usual!

63
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,703
Felix,

64
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,572
Themis,

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,973
Roy,

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,508
all of you…

67
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,910
Don't tell me…

68
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,547
you like him more than me?

69
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,027
Shitarakku?

70
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,628
His real name is Takumi Shitara.

71
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,231
He has 300,000 subscribers to his channel.

72
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,833
He's a popular influencer.

73
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,971
Rakku rakku, I'm Shitarakku!

74
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,408
Let's get excited to solve everyone's
homework problems again today!

75
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,942
Are you all ready?

76
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,614
This man has filed a lawsuit against
an advertising agency

77
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,083
that we're a legal advisor for,
Epic Ad Agency.

78
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,885
DEFENDANT: EPIC AD AGENCY
SUED

79
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,255
It's a case to claim damages
for the infringement of portrait rights

80
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,290
on an uncontracted matter.

81
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,258
DAMAGE CLAIM

82
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,594
LEGAL COMPLAINT

83
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,730
By the way,

84
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,766
have you found your 100th?

85
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,970
Please don't worry.
I can manage everything on my own.

86
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,739
Excuse me.

87
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,941
CORPORATE LAW DEPARTMENT
REPRESENTATIVE PARTNER

88
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,049
The lawsuits of our key advisors
will be cleared today.

89
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,219
As well as
the share transfer agreement review.

90
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,588
And the claim on patent fees.

91
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,992
EPIC AD AGENCY CASE

92
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,154
So he's still here.

93
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,525
What is this?

94
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,828
This? It's dinner.

95
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,463
This is uncalled for.

96
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,198
Okay, now have a seat.

97
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,133
Hey!

98
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,338
Um, I have a veggie-filled minestrone,

99
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:50,676
Caesar salad, focaccia hot off the grill,
and eggplant Bolognese for the main dish.

100
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,679
Anything you don't like?

101
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,082
What is this menu?

102
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,452
It's like he aimed for
all of my favorite foods!

103
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,888
Hmm? You aren't gonna eat?

104
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,326
Wasting food is not good.
I'll eat it for the planet.

105
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,228
Okay, then…

106
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,898
- Say "ah."
- Stop it!

107
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,333
- Hey!
- Ah!

108
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,737
How is it?

109
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,075
The tomatoes' sourness
and the veggies' sweetness melt together,

110
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,777
producing a deep flavor.

111
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:29,182
This quality matches up to the three-star
restaurant my client always takes me.

112
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,385
Oh, it almost feels
like a waste to swallow it,

113
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,687
because my tastebuds
are bursting with joy!

114
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,195
It's edible, at least.

115
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,765
I'm glad, I was confident in that dish.

116
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,667
Eat the others too.

117
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,701
Okay.

118
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,573
Here's some salad.

119
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,742
There you go.

120
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,161
It's edible, but barely.

121
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,332
This is kinda fun.

122
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,101
I feel like I became your housekeeper.

123
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,603
Huh?

124
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,439
My housekeeper Haruto.

125
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,341
Isn't this nice?

126
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,582
Oh, I have dessert too.
I made chocolate cake.

127
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,888
Uh, do you like chocolate cake?

128
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,725
I neither like it nor hate it.

129
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,929
I see. I'm glad!

130
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,836
Another bull's-eye!

131
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,820
The agency we represent chose Shitarakku

132
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,189
for the ad of a game
that uses virtual currency

133
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,625
and was working
to sign a contract with him.

134
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,398
But Shitarakku felt that the concept
of earning virtual currency in a game

135
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,934
would destroy
his educational channel image…

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,902
Oh, Ryo, are you working?

137
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,775
What, is that a case?

138
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,044
Don't look, it's confidential.

139
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,779
And…

140
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:40,746
And?

141
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,383
Don't walk around naked.

142
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,953
I'm not naked.

143
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,689
"Don't worry. I'm wearing!"

144
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,760
Don't walk around in underwear.

145
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,333
Ryo, you weren't wearing any before.

146
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,841
Don't worry, I didn't see.

147
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:09,909
You did see it!

148
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,344
An influencer, eh?

149
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,246
I know some influencers myself.

150
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,016
Hey!

151
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,453
You want me to look up this case?

152
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,689
You're having trouble finding
your 100th partner, right?

153
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,093
It's none of your business!

154
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,564
Hey, why don't you just try using me?

155
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,766
I'll be of good use.

156
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,472
Since I can become anyone I want.

157
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,708
Become anyone you want?

158
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,609
Yeah!

159
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,579
I'm your housekeeper right now too.

160
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,783
Give me a one-week probation.

161
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,852
I decline.

162
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,489
Then how about…

163
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,159
if you find that you can't make use of me…

164
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,462
I'll delete this for you.

165
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,465
And I'll even leave this house.

166
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,034
Okay?

167
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,469
Then it's worth a try, right?

168
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,174
What do you want?

169
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,876
Hmm?

170
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,045
Why do you wanna become my partner?!

171
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,683
Why do you think?

172
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,950
Huh?

173
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,852
Of course you wanna know.

174
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,455
But…

175
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,523
But?

176
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,796
Wouldn't it be boring
if you knew everything about me?

177
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,018
Haruto?

178
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,287
Let's see.

179
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,056
He's a mysterious boy, to say the least.

180
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,826
Huh?

181
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,296
But why do you want to know about Haruto?

182
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,531
It's nothing.

183
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,703
Oh, welcome!

184
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,572
Ah, you were here.

185
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,506
Gimme a beer.

186
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,407
Yes.

187
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,713
How's the Shitarakku case?

188
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,584
Well, I'm just getting started.

189
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:38,257
I have myself a pretty complex case too.

190
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,493
It's those real estate scammers.

191
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,964
Hmm?

192
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,298
What's wrong?

193
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,000
- Let me see that.
- Sure.

194
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,815
Seriously, what a sucker.

195
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,085
I must kick him out as soon as possible!

196
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,860
HARUTO: I'VE GOT BIG NEWS

197
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,330
Gathering information on Shitarakku
takes priority right now.

198
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,280
Welcome home!

199
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,081
You're just in time
for my late-night meal.

200
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,184
It's Taiwan-style chicken congee.

201
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,789
Oh, didn't you just suck in your belly?
Because your stomach almost growled.

202
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,192
Hurry up and gimme
your report on Shitarakku.

203
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:46,926
Okay.

204
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,295
I got a great recording!

205
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,431
Here.

206
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,876
Shared earphones switch on!

207
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,950
Listen to this part carefully.

208
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,085
Isn't this great evidence?

209
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,388
No.

210
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,494
Evidence collected
through illegal means like wiretapping

211
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,231
will be denied as valid evidence in court.

212
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,067
No matter what kind
of evidence was produced.

213
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,301
Yeah, I know.

214
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,504
That's the fruit
of the poisonous tree doctrine.

215
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,074
But that's in a criminal trial.

216
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,977
For a civil case,
you can submit any evidence.

217
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,381
Where did this guy pick up this knowledge?

218
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,085
See? Now it's been proven.

219
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,420
That I'm a useful guy to you.

220
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,161
Ryo, make me your 100th partner!

221
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,964
Come on already!

222
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,101
Hmm?

223
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,944
Shiba, do not lose sight of your goal.

224
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:18,484
That is to establish a brand
within the legal world called Ryoma Shiba.

225
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,252
Hey, Ryo.

226
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,590
You know what you need to do
in order to accomplish that.

227
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,891
Ryo!

228
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,362
This guy needs to…

229
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,098
Hey, Ryo!

230
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,133
Fine.

231
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,170
Starting today, you will be my partner.

232
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,506
Yes!

233
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,115
What's most important to me
is if this guy is usable or not.

234
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,818
Even if he is a fraud.

235
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,857
No, because he's a fraud,
he has access to underground information.

236
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,027
If things go downhill,
I can just sack him.

237
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,466
What I need is the underground
information this guy brings me.

238
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,769
In other words,
the fruit of the poisonous tree.

239
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,340
The fruit of the poisonous tree…

240
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:19,511
I wonder what kind
of luscious flavor that is.

241
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,811
Oh, I bet you were thinking
of something kinky just now, huh?

242
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,947
I was not!

243
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,921
Oh yeah, I forgot something important.

244
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:07,960
Business expenses!

245
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,936
70,000 yen for drinks at a bar?

246
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,508
Yeah, since I got champagne too
to make friends with people around me.

247
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,343
What are these costume fees?

248
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,312
Well, it'd be bad to go
to a high-end bar in casual wear.

249
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,015
So the clothing store recommended me
a bunch of clothes.

250
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,653
If your expenses go over 50,000 yen,
get permission first.

251
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,155
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,757
Okay! Then let's eat!

253
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,962
Mmm, looks good!

254
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,273
Here you go.

255
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,343
It's hot.

256
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,881
Thanks for the food.

257
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:09,922
Is it good?

258
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,992
It's edible, at least.

259
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:19,131
To you, "It's edible, at least" means
"It's so good, it's delicious," right?

260
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,036
You've got some on you.

261
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,446
Hey, Ryo.

262
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,218
Ryo…

263
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,956
you've never dated
anyone before, have you?

264
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,796
Yeah, I thought so.

265
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,631
I haven't said anything yet.

266
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,502
Hey.

267
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,107
How about we do this?

268
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,477
Hmm?

269
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,449
Ryo, I'm your 100th partner…

270
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,120
and I'll be your first lover.

271
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,081
What is this?

272
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,585
I have the path to victory.

273
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,322
I did a good job, right? So I get a treat.

274
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,957
