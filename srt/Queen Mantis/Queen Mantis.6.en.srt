00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

SEONGSIN PNP PRINTING

4
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,574
- Hello, sir.
- Sir.

5
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,912
Why are you all standing outside?

6
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,498
You should go inside.

7
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,638
He was in a hurry.

8
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,851
He just did it impulsively.
This isn't his style.

9
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,228
He took the hard drive.

10
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,105
No weapons discovered. There wasn't
even a strand of hair left behind.

11
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,135
He talked about how we used
to go to the beach together.

12
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,929
He said

13
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,391
he was happy back then.

14
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,601
Do you remember it too?

15
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,646
No.

16
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,486
I assume that woman is you,

17
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,656
and that boy is Min-jae.

18
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,616
It's you.

19
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,744
That boy standing next to me is you.

20
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,913
Min-jae…

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,460
was watching us from over here.

22
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,224
He was envious of you…

23
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,729
and he longed for me

24
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,315
to take care of him.

25
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,735
<i>Bro, I'm supposed to meet up</i>
<i>with Jo-i soon.</i>

26
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,528
<i>Don't forget to thank me later for this.</i>

27
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,281
<i>She is on my way to my studio now.</i>
<i>You'd better hurry up. Okay?</i>

28
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,366
Up until the end,

29
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,745
he tried to help me.

30
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,080
That perp will call again.

31
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,541
We must catch that scum.

32
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,544
Please help me.

33
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,466
I'll think like you.

34
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,177
I'll act as if I were you.

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
I will think like Jeong I-shin

36
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,557
and act like Jeong I-shin.

37
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,519
Please help us catch him.

SERIAL MURDER CASE FILE 1

39
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,811
AUTOPSY REPORT

40
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,065
VICTIM SONG BYEONG-CHEOL'S
CRIME SCENE

41
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,514
Welcome home.

42
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,182
It's been a while.

43
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,893
It's really late.

44
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,770
They need me for an urgent review.

45
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,690
It's not like that dead person
is going anywhere.

46
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,609
Jeez.

47
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,445
Acknowledging aid from someone
presumed dead is burdensome enough.

48
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,074
When they find out about Su-yeol,
damage control will be

49
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,826
virtually impossible, no?

50
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,911
Would Seung-pyo…

51
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,080
Would the commissioner

52
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,125
take the fall?

53
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,460
That was the condition Jeong I-shin set

54
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,212
in exchange for consulting on the case.

55
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,548
I shouldn't have accepted it.

56
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,509
Even now, I still can't tell

57
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,428
if I'm doing the right thing.

58
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,306
I messed up, didn't I?

59
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,479
Yesterday, a man in his 40s,
the breadwinner of his family,

60
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,524
hung himself in the house that made him
a victim of a real estate scam.

61
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,152
They couldn't find a suicide note,
so they even did an autopsy.

62
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,613
Eventually, they did find one,

63
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,117
and in it, he just apologized over
and over, begging for forgiveness.

64
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,453
It wasn't even his fault.

65
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,413
Right?

66
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,503
But the only thing
I could write down in his autopsy report

67
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,297
was "death by hanging."

68
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,467
Just those three words.

69
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,721
If I had been allowed
to share how I felt on that report…

70
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,601
What I'm trying to say is

71
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,480
we can't let emotions get in the way
in our line of work.

72
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,108
If you do, it just gets
ridiculously complicated.

73
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,279
Since you're here anyway,
you should snuggle with the kids.

74
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,948
With intention
and some heartfelt emotions.

75
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,076
Will do. Drive safely.

76
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,328
Bye.

77
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,862
- And the SOU?
- They're on standby.

78
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,662
You know what to do, right?

79
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,413
Stall as long as you can.

80
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,207
You can't upset him in any way.

81
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,833
BLOCKED NUMBER

82
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,588
Answer it.

83
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,887
<i>Hello.</i>

84
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,472
Who's calling?

85
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,059
<i>It's me. As if you didn't know.</i>

86
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,936
<i>The webtoon artist.</i>

87
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,188
<i>Was that you?</i>

88
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,358
<i>Of course. Who else could it be?</i>

89
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,987
<i>Oh, I see…</i>

90
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,281
<i>It just felt so unpolished.</i>

91
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,951
<i>It wasn't done in either of our styles.</i>

92
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>There was just a whole bunch of mirrors</i>
<i>and some terribly sloppy painting,</i>

93
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,958
<i>leaving behind an obnoxious signature</i>
<i>for all to see.</i>

94
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>It was quite a scene.</i>

95
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,172
<i>All that talk</i>
<i>about the "final scene" or whatever…</i>

96
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,508
Was all that just fluff?

97
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,427
What's she doing?

98
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,931
<i>How was that scene not final?</i>

99
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>He croaked while painting a scene.</i>
<i>That was his "final scene."</i>

100
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,861
<i>I haven't laughed like that</i>
<i>in a long while.</i>

101
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,492
You wish to remind everyone of my legacy?

102
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,579
You?

103
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,750
I<i> would never.</i>

104
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,337
<i>You're just some lame excuse</i>
<i>for a copycat.</i>

105
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,218
- Wait.
- What was that?

106
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,476
Captain Cha.

107
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,324
There we go.

108
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,459
<i>La-dee-da.</i>

109
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,543
<i>Hey.</i>

110
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,797
<i>So clingy.</i>

111
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,091
<i>You're about to be so jealous of me.</i>

112
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,550
<i>Why?</i>

113
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,928
I'm getting curious.

114
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,514
<i>Guess.</i>

115
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,600
<i>You're in prison, and I'm out here.</i>

116
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,853
<i>You can't, but I can.</i>

117
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,814
<i>The fourth?</i>

118
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,107
"The fourth."

119
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,444
Kang Yeong-ho
from the coal miners' housing.

120
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,987
His nose was seared with a hot spoon,

121
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,824
and all four of his limbs were broken,
before bleeding to death.

122
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,827
<i>That's right. The fourth.</i>

123
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,371
<i>If I'm being honest,</i>
<i>I rushed a bit last time.</i>

124
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
<i>Can't deny it.</i>

125
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>My deepest apologies.</i>

126
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,127
<i>That one was spontaneous,</i>

127
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,129
<i>but the next one will be the real deal.</i>

128
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,588
<i>It's right around the corner.</i>

129
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,590
<i>I dare you to hang up on me again.</i>

130
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,175
Sorry.

131
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,138
Did you prepare the spoon?
That's important.

132
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,306
<i>I got everything.</i>

133
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,975
<i>I even got a hand torch.</i>

134
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,185
<i>Excellent.</i>

135
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,898
<i>This almost makes it feel like</i>
<i>we're doing this together.</i>

136
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,152
<i>I feel that too.</i>

137
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,361
<i>You know the order, right?</i>

138
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>I do.</i>

139
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,698
<i>Oh, so well.</i>

140
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,244
Are you sure that woman
is helping us right now?

141
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,372
What the? Who's that?

142
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,832
<i>Oh, he's here.</i>

143
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,916
<i>See you later.</i>

144
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,965
Ji-an.

145
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,176
Check that footage
and find out where that is.

146
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,802
- Yes, sir.
- Once we're there,

147
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,763
we'll secure the security office,
the entrance, and the parking lot.

148
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,224
Review the building's visitor log
from the past 30 minutes,

149
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,101
and see if any of them follow Jo-i.

150
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,853
- You heard him.
- Yes.

151
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
Here we go.

152
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,158
This is Bae Sung-gyu from Major Crimes
requesting SOU backup.

153
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,326
I found it.

154
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,411
Just a moment.

155
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,705
ESTO PREMIER HOTEL

156
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,749
Esto Premier Hotel.

157
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,335
Esto Premier Hotel in Yeonho-dong. Thanks.

158
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,545
- Okay. Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

159
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,050
<i>Captain Cha.</i>

160
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,727
Only a fool would expect
to catch him without bloodshed.

161
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,438
No.

162
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
I don't expect to.

163
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,984
<i>You must think</i>

164
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,820
<i>like him, like me, Jeong-ho.</i>

165
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,915
SOU is on its way.
They should arrive within ten minutes.

166
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,961
Ji-an will remain behind
and log on to the hotel's intranet.

167
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,671
She'll search through their CCTV footage.

168
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,256
We're on our way.

169
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,341
Tell Jeong I-shin to stall
as long as she can.

170
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,219
Captain Cha asked you
to buy them some time.

171
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,233
Be patient. Let him wake up
from the anesthesia first.

172
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,693
You know my style.

173
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,822
I didn't use any.

174
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,240
He likes being tied up.

175
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,576
He even brought his own stockings.

176
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,374
It's not fun if it's too easy.

177
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,043
<i>Today's gear includes</i>

178
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>a hammer made in Korea.</i>

179
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,798
<i>You need to calm down.</i>

180
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,174
Calm down already.

181
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,510
We're just getting started.

182
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,928
<i>Why are you so scared?</i>

183
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,510
Make way.

184
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,887
Police coming through.

185
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,514
Police. Where's the security office?

186
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,599
It's that way.

187
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,601
- Make way.
- I'm with the police.

188
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,311
- Please make way.
- What's going on?

189
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,398
We're connected
to the hotel's CCTV system.

190
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,608
Where is this room?

191
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,109
That's a studio suite room.

192
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,904
Out of our 194 rooms, 57 of them
are studio suite rooms.

193
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,364
What are the floors?

194
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,908
They span the 3rd through the 13th floors.

195
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,369
Can you tell us which ones are occupied?

196
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,081
Mystiy Night is performing nearby.

197
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,375
A group reservation
has us at full occupancy.

198
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,418
They all checked in 30 minutes ago.

199
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,337
Most of them should be in their rooms now.

200
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,259
Pairs of SOU officers can start
on 13 and sweep downward.

201
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,469
- Sung-gyu, lead that.
- Okay.

202
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,513
Detective Kim and I will start
from 3 and move up.

203
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,891
Hyuk, you seal off possible escape routes.

204
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,060
Sir. The victim is already in danger.

205
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,229
Let's seal the escape routes
and ring the alarm.

206
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,772
We need to save the victim first.

207
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,733
We're just starting our search
from floors 3 and 13.

208
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,069
What if he hears the alarm
and bolts from another floor?

209
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,612
We can't risk that.

210
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,780
We must catch the culprit.

211
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
Quickly.

212
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,556
Room number 1305, 1304, 1312,
1317 to 1320, and 1322.

213
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,349
Check every one of them.

214
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,475
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

215
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,653
Room number 304, 305, 312,
317 to 320, and 322.

216
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,779
- Move out.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,826
Pardon us. We're with the police.

218
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,415
My apologies. I'm with the police.

219
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,752
Sorry. Enjoy your stay.

220
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,796
Police. Pardon us.

221
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,382
Pardon us. We're with the police.

222
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,305
We're with the police.
Pardon us for a second.

223
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,890
Thank you.

224
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,153
<i>That's a workout.</i>

225
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,574
<i>What do you want to see next?</i>

226
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,701
His arms? Or maybe his legs?

227
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,661
The neck will be over too quickly. Right?

228
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,752
Ji-an, are you done with the CCTV footage?

229
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,836
Yes.

230
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,963
None of the guests appears
on Jo-i's list of followers.

231
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>The highlight of today.</i>

232
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,051
<i>The spoon</i>

233
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,553
<i>and hand torch duo.</i>

234
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,347
Hold on. What about the mirrors?

235
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,016
<i>Today is just for you.</i>

236
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,268
<i>I will faithfully emulate your style.</i>

237
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,396
What? You don't need to do all that.

238
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,190
<i>I know the police are there with you.</i>

239
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,652
<i>If you try to stall</i>
<i>or pull some other nonsense…</i>

240
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,905
Don't be absurd.

241
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,118
<i>All right. This is my favorite part.</i>

242
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,639
<i>All possible escape routes are sealed off.</i>

243
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,641
He'll die at this rate.

244
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,101
Sir.

245
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,229
The escape routes are sealed.
Let's just ring the alarm now.

246
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,397
Captain Cha.

247
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,277
He's following the same M.O.
as the murder 23 years ago.

248
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,528
Captain Cha.

249
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,988
If we ring the alarm,

250
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,199
he'll catch on and flee.

251
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,160
Even if he does, we can catch him.

252
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,828
All escape routes are sealed.

253
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,373
As long as he doesn't jump off the roof,
we'll be able to catch him,

254
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,875
even if he's on another floor.

255
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,669
He will end up dead at this rate!

256
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,797
Some bloodshed will be inevitable
if we want to catch the culprit.

257
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,008
- Okay?
- What does that mean?

258
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,092
Stop.

259
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,760
Just stop for a minute.

260
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,974
<i>You must think</i>

261
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,393
like him, like me, Jeong-ho.

262
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,855
<i>Sir.</i>

263
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,399
CCTV cameras on the fourth floor
were turned off two hours ago.

264
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,367
Room 418.

265
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,535
What?

266
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,621
It's Room 418.

267
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,291
Block off all entry points
to the fourth floor.

268
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,519
<i>Here comes the finale!</i>

269
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,188
Sir!

270
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,572
- What's going on?
- What the?

271
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,620
Don't push. Remain calm.

272
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,497
Make way.

273
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,415
Please remain calm.

274
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,125
We're with the police. Please make way.

275
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,795
The perp's dressed like the guests.

276
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,507
Please stick to the walls. Police.

277
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,717
Coming through.
Please stick to the walls.

278
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,094
You need to make way.

279
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,804
Coming through.

280
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,222
Please make way.

281
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,101
Coming through. Be careful.

282
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,781
Call for an ambulance now.

283
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,409
Sir.

284
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,077
Can you hear me?

285
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,996
I'm with the police.

286
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,664
Sir?

287
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,834
Sir, it's all over now. Don't worry.

288
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,602
Show yourself!

289
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,747
Captain Cha!

290
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,794
Sir, are you all right?

291
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,337
There…

292
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,634
AMBULANCE

293
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,055
Sir.

294
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,392
The victim's name is Son Hyeon-ho.
He followed Jo-i.

295
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,895
He's the general manager here.

296
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,316
He got away because we assumed
the victim would be a guest.

297
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,361
Luckily, the victim is still alive.

298
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,156
Good job today.

299
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,424
But did Captain Cha
ring the alarm earlier?

300
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,594
Wow. Look at his quick thinking.

301
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,638
It was me.

302
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,976
He didn't want to.
He thought it would make the perp flee.

303
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,519
What?

304
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,021
He said, catching him
would involve some bloodshed.

305
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,900
What the hell has gotten into him?

306
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,571
Park Min-jae.

307
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,655
What?

308
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,784
Min-jae, you can't die.

309
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,077
Wake up!

310
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,496
You need to wake up, Min-jae!

311
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,582
I will think like Jeong I-shin

312
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,458
and act like Jeong I-shin.

313
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,086
Please help us catch him.

314
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,965
Sung-gyu.

315
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,467
See if you can find any dirt on Cha.

316
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,596
- Captain Cha?
- Yeah.

317
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,349
See if you can find out

318
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,895
why he was suddenly transferred
to our team from Narcotics.

319
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,814
And why it had to be him.

320
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,567
Find out what his relationship
with Park Min-jae is,

321
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,111
and why he did a complete 180 recently.

322
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,956
How can you be late again?

323
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,041
Sorry.

324
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,587
Considering your son's condition

325
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,339
and his young age,

326
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,966
custody will most likely go
to you, his mother.

327
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,384
Okay.

328
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,970
But still, be careful.
The custody evaluator will be present.

329
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,263
Understood.

330
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,604
My apologies.

331
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,522
- Frog back legs.
- Hello.

332
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,901
Frog back legs.

333
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,784
Ho-jun, can you tell me
how many people live in your house?

334
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,295
Are those people here right now?

335
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,428
Wow, what an excellent drawing.

336
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,139
Did you draw this, Ho-jun?

337
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,727
Who is this?

338
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,274
Then, who is this?

339
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,655
Wow. Well done.

340
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,575
Then, where is your mommy?

341
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,291
So, this is your mommy.

342
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,085
Ma'am, please ask him if he's happier

343
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,504
with his mom or dad. Thank you.

344
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,298
Hold on. That was never on the agenda.

345
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,382
No.

346
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,801
Ho-jun is stressed enough as it is.

347
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,554
- A question like that will be…
- We must ask.

348
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,930
No, you can't.

349
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,350
Can we conclude here?

350
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,729
Ho-jun must be quite distressed already.

351
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,982
You can ask him.

352
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,108
Wait, honey.

353
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,192
Ma'am.

354
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,820
Please ask him.

355
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,777
You almost got him.

356
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,070
"Almost"?

357
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,988
He almost killed someone.

358
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,826
The victim is still alive.

359
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,079
You probably don't care.

360
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,504
This was in Yeonpo.

361
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,006
Do you remember?

362
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,176
The three of us,

363
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,222
including Min-jae,
used to spend the whole day at the beach.

364
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,483
<i>I added Min-jae to the painting.</i>

365
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,028
I remember the beach.

366
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,739
Would he be happy about that?

367
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,667
This was taken at the hotel crime scene.

368
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,793
And…

369
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,213
this is the file for the fourth murder
you committed 23 years ago.

370
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,464
WOONGSAN SERIAL MURDER CASE
FILE 4

371
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,801
He tried to recreate this murder.

372
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,970
Compare the two incidents,

373
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,389
and let me know if you find something.

374
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,937
I can't go back there.

375
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,314
Do what you will with it.

376
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,111
You know this song, don't you?

377
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,657
He even hummed
the same song from 23 years ago.

378
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,619
How did he know about this?

379
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,497
It wasn't mentioned
in your confession, either.

380
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,212
- He was at the scene.
- He was at the scene.

381
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,547
Right?

382
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,841
He was there.

383
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,011
He watched you at the scene of the crime.

384
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,472
Then, why didn't he

385
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,974
report it to the police later?

386
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,941
Because I made his wish come true?

387
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,534
These two stab wounds

388
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,244
weren't my doing.

389
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,251
They were 1.5 cm wide.

390
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,670
They were shallow wounds.

391
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,007
These could've been made
with a small blade like a box cutter.

392
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,428
That was the best
he could do, even with full force.

393
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,515
He must have been hiding
in a wardrobe or something.

394
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,016
After I left,

395
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,812
his resentment must have led him
to stab the corpse even more…

396
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,694
The victim had

397
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,280
a wife and young son.

398
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,656
He had just two family members.

399
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,158
If they were shallow wounds…

400
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,871
Do you remember that mining town?

401
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,456
Yes.

402
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,042
There was a boy
who was always walking around.

403
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,987
Mommy!

404
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,829
<i>That boy used to carry around</i>
<i>a dead cat as if it were a stuffed animal.</i>

405
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,583
His body was covered
in all sorts of wounds.

406
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:04,297
One side of his nose was even deformed,
due to a terrible burn injury.

407
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,842
Kang Yeong-ho.

408
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,097
He locked his son up in the bathroom
and made him consume human waste.

409
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,309
The boy was chained at the ankles.

410
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,686
Eventually,

411
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,607
he couldn't even stand the boy breathing,
so he heated up a spoon over a fire

412
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,108
and brought it to the boy's nose.

413
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,696
How could he do that to his son?

414
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,449
Your daddy tried to kill you too.

415
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,582
He was 12 years old at the time.

416
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,627
Kang Yeon-joong is his name.

417
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,672
That boy must have watched me
at the scene.

418
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,065
<i>In that boy's eyes,</i>

419
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,734
<i>I was the one who made</i>
<i>his long-held wish come true.</i>

420
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,238
<i>It's no wonder he was curious about me.</i>

421
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,032
That must have led him

422
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,576
to finding out about you

423
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,662
and your family.

424
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,040
Your home.

425
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,584
Jung-yeon.

426
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,006
I'm saying your wife is in danger.

427
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,972
Chief Choi.

428
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,641
I need a security detail right now.

429
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,269
For Jung-yeon. Yes.

430
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,784
It appears the culprit
even hummed the same tune

431
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,369
as Jung I-shin had

432
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,456
at her crime scene 23 years ago.

433
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,957
The fact that he knew about this

434
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,667
means that he witnessed her crime.

435
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,711
He could've even been hiding nearby.

436
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,588
Kang Yeong-ho,

437
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,008
her murder victim 23 years ago, had a son.

438
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,219
The abuse that boy endured was so heinous,

439
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,638
some members of the media
even defended Jeong I-shin.

440
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,016
This is Kang Yeon-joong, his son.

441
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,941
He appears to be
the true perpetrator behind this case.

442
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,526
KANG YEON-JOONG

443
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,236
This is his resident registration card.

444
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,780
But…

445
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,657
this is the only record
of him I could find.

446
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,786
His mother was admitted
to a nursing hospital

447
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,829
due to alcohol-induced dementia
around this time.

448
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,165
But after that,
he never even had a change of address.

449
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,501
He has no bank accounts or credit cards.

450
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,754
He must've hired somebody
to make him a new identity or something.

451
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,341
Even I wouldn't keep that name.

452
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,343
His time with that name

453
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,929
must've been hell on earth.

454
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,892
Do you have an address
for his mother's nursing hospital?

455
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,852
It's in Sangbong. It's not far.

456
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,145
Text me the address.

457
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,855
You two can question

458
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,941
the victim's acquaintances.

459
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,359
- Okay.
- Let's go.

460
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,759
Right. That's exactly why.

461
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,096
He doesn't care one bit about human lives.

462
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,140
All he cares about is getting credit.

463
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,934
Why do we catch criminals?

464
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,811
We're trying to avoid more victims--

465
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,937
Did you even ask him?

466
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,856
What?

467
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,482
Did you ask Captain Cha if he did that

468
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,819
for credit, or if he was just trying to do
whatever it took to avoid more victims?

469
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,821
- I mean…
- The culprit got away.

470
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,657
What are you trying to say?

471
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,702
There he is.

472
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,581
Aren't we all on the same team?

473
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,625
Whatever.

474
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,879
Digging for dirt on a fellow team member…

475
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,757
I'm out. Knock yourself out.

476
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,638
"Knock myself out"?

477
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,183
That punk thinks
he can disrespect me like that?

478
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,226
Fine. I'll knock myself out.

479
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,317
Yes, that's right. Kang Yeon-joong.

480
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,738
Have you seen your son recently?

481
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,531
Yeon-joong?

482
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,745
My son?

483
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,248
He needs to flee.

484
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,501
My husband is hunting him down.

485
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,586
Why?

486
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,547
Yeon-joong needs to flee.

487
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,632
Why?

488
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,968
Why does Kang Yeon-joong need to flee?

489
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,553
Ma'am.

490
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,764
Ma'am!

491
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,890
Sir,

492
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,974
may I have a word?

493
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,022
Is there anything you can recall?

494
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,941
We believe the victim met her.

495
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,695
Well, the thing is, he's a close friend.

496
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,865
Your friend is in the ICU
because of this perp.

497
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,200
We need to catch the culprit.

498
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,536
You can just tell us
whatever you remember.

499
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,621
It's okay.

500
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,793
If I'm being honest, he does have
a bit of a sleazy side.

501
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,338
He was subscribed to all sorts of apps,
and he hooked up with all sorts of women.

502
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,131
Her too?

503
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,383
Yes.

504
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,843
Take a look at this.

505
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,222
He went on and on
about how excited he was about this chick.

506
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,932
And then, just radio silence.

507
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,977
I'm a man too.
It's only natural for me to be curious.

508
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,063
So, I bought him a glass of wine or two,
and started poking him.

509
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,732
That's when he finally told me the truth.

510
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,193
That he stepped in some real shit.

511
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,820
- "Real shit"?
- Yeah.

512
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:01,904
What do you mean?

513
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,781
Oh, her face?

514
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,241
He said she had the looks.

515
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,160
I mean, the pictures on her profile
were all definitely fake.

516
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,371
But apparently,
that's just common in this app.

517
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,832
Most people don't have
face pics on their profiles.

518
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,417
But the real issue was…

519
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,295
So ridiculous…

520
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,630
Wait, should I even be sharing all this?

521
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,257
Why not? We're the police.

522
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,301
You can relax.

523
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,803
Sir, repeat after me.

524
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,763
"Frog back legs."

525
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,640
Where did that come from?

526
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,559
Just try it.

527
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,602
"Frog back legs."

528
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,688
Smile at the end of "legs."

529
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,484
"Frog back legs."

530
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,944
- "Legs."
- "Legs."

531
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,740
People like her tend to pay more attention
to people's expressions

532
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,616
than the words they are saying.

533
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,909
That's why.

534
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,704
"Frog back legs."

535
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,872
Right.

536
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,134
That insane bastard met women here,
secretly at his workplace.

537
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,969
- Jo-i too?
- Yeah.

538
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,973
Jo-i asked him to turn off
all the lights as soon as they entered.

539
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,933
And that's when he felt something off.

540
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,312
But he didn't want to look like a punk,

541
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,646
so he just let her.

542
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,231
And then?

543
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,985
Did she threaten
or intimidate him in any way?

544
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:23,903
The opposite.

545
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,529
- "The opposite"?
- Yeah.

546
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,324
In the middle of "doing the deed,"

547
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,077
she suddenly asked him to choke her.

548
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,453
- She did?
- Yeah.

549
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,873
He just assumed she had
a bit of a freaky side,

550
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,625
so he just pretended to.

551
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,586
But she suddenly started shouting,
"Harder! Choke me harder!"

552
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,671
She kept pushing him even more.

553
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,549
Then, he got scared
about actually harming her,

554
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,760
so he stopped there.

555
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,013
And then, he came up with some sort
of excuse and bolted out of there.

556
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,598
Anything else?

557
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,809
What else…

558
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,854
What scared him the most

559
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,023
was when he was choking her,

560
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,151
she entered a state of frenzy,
and asked him

561
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,070
to just kill her.

562
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,490
She told him if he did,
he'd be saving a lot of people.

563
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,451
Isn't that just so creepy?

564
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,286
That's why he stopped.

565
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,291
Ma'am.

566
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,460
You see,

567
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,171
I ask because I'm really curious.

568
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,215
Can you tell me

569
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,510
why Yeon-joong needs to flee?

570
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,310
He killed Dallae.

571
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,859
Can you tell me who Dallae is?

572
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,278
The dog.

573
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:53,868
The next-door neighbor's dog.

574
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,287
A puppy.

575
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,539
It sounds like she's a bit mixed up.

576
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,127
Ma'am.

577
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,379
Yeon-joong.

578
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,341
Have you seen him recently?

579
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,638
When?

580
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,726
Just now.

581
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,729
Pardon?

582
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,694
He's dolled up again.

583
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,822
To become a girl.

584
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,701
He put on makeup again.

585
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,496
He needs to flee.

586
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,498
My husband is coming.

587
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,458
Excuse me.

588
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,169
By chance, did she have
another visitor before us?

589
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,672
Yes, she left
right before you two got here.

590
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,887
Yes, Detective Kim.

591
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,475
<i>They have a visitors' log,</i>
<i>but their CCTV is broken.</i>

592
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,520
According to the nurses and receptionists,

593
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,480
she had a hoodie and a mask on,

594
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,940
but she was definitely a woman.

595
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,817
A woman?

596
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,402
<i>Yes.</i>

597
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:28,837
Yes?

598
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,673
Nothing to report.

599
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:32,925
Sure.

600
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,885
Keep up the good work.

601
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,644
She said Kang Yeon-joong was there.

602
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,398
With her severe dementia,

603
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,233
it's difficult to question her.

604
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,362
Even if Kang Yeon-joong really was there,

605
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,114
there's no way to verify it.

606
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,198
Well…

607
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,201
I thought about it.

608
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,079
Kang Yeon-joong's mother

609
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,291
may not always be lucid,

610
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,460
but everything she told us may be true.

611
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,670
What do you mean?

612
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,797
She claimed he was her son,

613
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,968
that he carried around
a cat or dog he killed,

614
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,928
and that he wore makeup.

615
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,097
If all of that is true,

616
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,890
I'm not sure

617
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,019
if this is some sort of response
to his father's abuse

618
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,104
or if he had long experienced
gender dysphoria,

619
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,439
but what I'm sure of is this.

620
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,483
Kang Yeon-joong had displayed

621
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,444
antisocial behavior since he was a child.

622
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,780
He could have experienced gender dysphoria

623
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,785
as a sort of trauma response
to his abusive childhood.

624
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,870
If that's the case,

625
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,331
now, after 23 years,

626
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,042
Kang Yeon-joong's appearance may be

627
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,254
completely different.
He may have even transitioned.

628
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,339
So, you're saying

629
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,842
the woman who visited the nursing hospital

630
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,385
could be Kang Yeon-joong a.k.a. Jo-i?

631
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,681
Come on now. That's a bit far-fetched, no?

632
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,892
You said it yourself.

633
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,479
Kang Yeon-joong's childhood
was no different from hell on earth.

634
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,605
With that in mind,

635
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,732
Kang Yeon-joong's trauma response

636
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,235
may have been
to reinvent his identity entirely.

637
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,237
The trauma was so hellish,

638
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,989
that rebirth as a whole new person

639
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,909
became his only means of survival?

640
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,169
LOOKING FOR A CLINIC THAT DOESN'T
REQUIRE A PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT

641
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,462
OR GENDER DYSPHORIA
CERTIFICATION

642
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,064
Jeez.

643
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,193
We suspect this person

644
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,780
may have undergone plastic surgery,
and now looks like one of these pictures.

645
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,784
Have you seen anyone who resembled
any of these faces you see here?

646
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,413
ITAEWON

647
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,209
Thank you for meeting with me.

648
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,922
Gender confirmation surgery

649
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,842
tends to be a long
and arduous process in Korea.

650
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,720
Even after being diagnosed
with code F64.0, gender dysphoria,

651
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,223
by a psychiatrist,

652
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,060
you need to go through hormone treatment
for six months to a year.

653
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,229
Then, did you also have to…

654
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,440
Yes. I had mine done in Thailand.

655
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,778
By chance, do you recognize her?

656
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,325
I do not.

657
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,663
After all, I'm not friends
with every transgender woman in the world.

658
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,959
It appears she may have gone overseas
for easier surgical access.

659
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,879
The surgery can involve
a range of potential complications,

660
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,714
and long-term post-op care is essential.

661
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,090
After she got back,

662
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,218
she must've seen a doctor for post-op care
or additional feminizing surgery.

663
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,012
Sir.

664
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,181
This is the list of clinics.

665
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,891
Let's see.

666
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,144
Clinics that specialize in feminizing
and gender confirmation surgeries.

667
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,023
LUMINOUS PLASTIC SURGERY

668
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,373
He went out of his way to drive home

669
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,335
Park Min-jae, a suspect in the case.

670
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,922
And his wailing of "Min-jae!"

671
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,675
proves they shared a close, personal bond.

672
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,137
And now, his cherished friend
has been murdered.

673
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,850
Man…

674
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,561
The world is crawling
with Jeong I-shin copycats.

675
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,607
Just look at these drawings.

676
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,821
Here.

677
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,202
I'm not sure.

678
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:13,163
It would be a bit difficult
to identify someone with this.

679
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,042
Thank you for your cooperation.

680
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,758
Then, by any chance,

681
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,677
disregarding these photos,

682
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,680
have there been any patients
who seemed a bit unusual?

683
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,203
Excuse me. Detective.

684
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,372
Yes?

685
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,084
I used to work at another clinic.

686
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,422
And you met her there?

687
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,881
Yes.

688
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:08,343
That clinic was well-known
in the community,

689
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,846
and a lot of its patients
were members of the community.

690
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,808
Botched surgery overseas

691
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,977
can even lead to pelvic necrosis.

692
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,146
I've seen my share
of critical care patients as well.

693
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,565
But even with the risk of death,

694
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,109
they go through with the surgery.

695
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,237
Some have told me

696
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,741
they have lived their whole lives
with female souls, trapped in male bodies.

697
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,035
This was their path to happiness.

698
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,953
And what about her?

699
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,832
That patient was
a bit different from the others.

700
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,419
Of course, she was also happy

701
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,130
about having a body that reflected

702
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,507
who she truly was.

703
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,761
But I also heard her muttering to herself.

704
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,433
"It's such an advantage that society
doesn't see women as threats."

705
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,185
Pardon?

706
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,029
You heard, right?

707
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,781
I think she's the perp.

708
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,534
I got the clinic and the doctor
that nurse used to work for.

709
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,831
It's hard to believe she'd go so far
as gender confirmation

710
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,250
for the sake of making murder easier.

711
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,003
But I'm certain she actually
exploited that line of thinking.

712
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,254
This is our perp.

713
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,339
Hyuk.

714
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,216
According to that nurse,

715
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,677
the clinic has closed,
so we need to find the doctor.

716
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,845
Once we do, we can catch our perp.

717
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,894
What's wrong?

718
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,145
Did something happen?

719
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,952
Jeong I-shin…

720
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,787
and Park Min-jae.

721
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,456
So?

722
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,500
Unfold it.

723
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,390
We really went through hell

724
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,642
to figure out who that kid was.

725
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,019
You said you weren't hiding anything else.

726
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,439
Mr. Cha Su-yeol.

727
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,399
Please leave our team.

728
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,449
We're so close.

729
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,161
Let's ask around and find this doctor.

730
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,454
Then, we can catch the perp.

731
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,582
I wonder.
Did Jeong I-shin tell you to do that too?

732
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,715
Yes, that woman…

733
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,050
is indeed my mom.

734
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,635
So what?

735
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,721
What about it?

736
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,056
Are you worried the fact she's my mother

737
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,851
will negatively affect the investigation?

738
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,603
Are you?

739
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,438
Please leave.

740
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,232
What exactly didn't work out
because of me?

741
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,944
I assume she wanted you in exchange
for her consultation on this case,

742
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,697
but with the culprit confirmed,

743
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,033
she's useless to us now.

744
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,285
And that makes me useless as well?

745
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,745
Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

746
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,373
You swore you weren't hiding
anything else from us.

747
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,544
We have no need for a captain
who deceives his own team.

748
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,629
Especially one,

749
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,674
who has no interest
in keeping victims alive.

750
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,759
So what?

751
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,972
Is Son Hyeon-ho… dead?

752
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,808
He would've, if we waited a second more.

753
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,101
So, is he dead right now? Damn it.

754
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,062
You lied to us all, you prick!

755
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,902
We refuse to take

756
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,488
any more orders from him.

757
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,615
We're done.

758
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,534
You can choose, sir.

759
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,119
Who do you want on your team?

760
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,247
Us or him?

761
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,000
Sir, we're so close right now.

762
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,627
We can catch the perp now.

763
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,881
Son Hyeon-ho, that hotel manager…

764
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,218
He just passed away.

765
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,287
Su-yeol.

766
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,746
If you follow after him,

767
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,624
we'll take it as you wanting him
on your team.

768
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,148
Su-yeol must be home.

769
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,780
Do you want to be alone?

770
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,242
Jung-yeon.

771
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:09,913
Do you remember

772
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,458
that story Min-jae told you?

773
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,586
The one about

774
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,464
the serial killer living

775
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,841
in our town when we were really little?

776
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,971
The Mantis?

777
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,360
The serial killer…

778
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,737
The Mantis…

779
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,158
is my mom.

780
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,420
Ms. Lee Jung-yeon?

781
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,673
Jeong I-shin

782
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,760
was arrested when I was 11 years old.

783
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,682
She was arrested for brutally murdering

784
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,851
no less than five men.

785
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,148
And 23 years later,
I was reunited with her.

786
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,066
Mr. Jeong.

787
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,279
My maternal grandfather
even changed my name,

788
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,991
set up a fake gravesite in Yeonpo
as if his daughter had died,

789
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,492
and tried to leave all that behind.

790
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,161
And…

791
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,333
I just need a second.

792
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:11,993
I'm sorry.

793
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,537
I didn't want

794
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,831
to shock you like this. I mean…

795
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,501
It's only natural for you to be shocked.

796
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,046
Someone who killed five…

797
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:25,632
No, a serial killer who killed six people

798
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,176
is the mother of your husband.

799
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:31,763
It's shocking. Terrifying. It's a given.

800
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,681
I know that.

801
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,601
I… You see, but…

802
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,771
But she was here.

803
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,315
I didn't know she was so loathsome.

804
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,025
Yes, loathsome.

805
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,529
I find myself loathsome too.

806
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,907
Su-yeol, I'm not saying you are.
What I meant was…

807
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,575
Then,

808
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,828
why did you walk away from me?

809
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,915
You got it all wrong.

810
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,458
That's not it.

811
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,043
It's okay.

812
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,379
I understand.

813
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,673
I just…

814
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,176
It's just a lot to take in at once.

815
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,264
No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

816
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,933
Jung-yeon, I know…

817
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,356
you want to have a baby.

818
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,441
Su-yeol.

819
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,567
But…

820
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,154
The thing is…

821
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,490
I am terrified of myself.

822
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,451
It feels like

823
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,078
the blood of Jeong I-shin,
that monster who gave birth to me,

824
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,122
is running through my veins.

825
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,124
That savage,

826
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,084
nasty,

827
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,377
terrifying,

828
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,421
loathsome blood!

829
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,882
After I became a police officer,

830
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,011
every time I looked
at the crime scene of a heinous murder,

831
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,264
every time I took out my gun
to catch a criminal,

832
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,808
every time I was drenched in blood,

833
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,061
a thought crossed my mind.

834
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,192
Do I…

835
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,195
enjoy the scent of blood?

836
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,073
Maybe I don't care
about catching criminals.

837
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,952
Maybe I just want to be able
to shoot someone dead legally.

838
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,747
That's what crosses my mind.

839
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,624
Su-yeol.

840
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,960
I don't want that blood
you know nothing about…

841
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,965
to be passed down--

842
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,092
What are you even talking about?

843
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,428
- No…
- Su-yeol.

844
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,146
I love you, Jung-yeon.

845
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,442
I'm sorry for lying to you.

846
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,810
<i>The perp is excited right now.</i>

847
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,937
<i>She's trying to clean up her tracks.</i>

848
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,105
Bring me Su-yeol right now.

849
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,940
<i>He is just as desperate as you.</i>

850
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,651
<i>What if this isn't a narrative</i>
<i>about a mother aiding her son?</i>

851
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,362
<i>What if it's one where the mother</i>
<i>is using her son with sinister intentions?</i>

852
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,406
She said you were happy because of her.

853
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,825
How did you meet Jung-yeon?

854
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,994
<i>Send all available units in the area.</i>

855
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,287
<i>Jeong I-shin is coming here?</i>

856
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,747
<i>It's a special order</i>
<i>from the commissioner.</i>

857
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,999
<i>We'll operate independently going forward.</i>

858
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,792
<i>You will end up dead if you go there.</i>

859
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,960
<i>I have to do this.</i>

860
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,963
