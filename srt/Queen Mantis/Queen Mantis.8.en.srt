1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,980
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL SERIES "LA MANTE"
PRODUCED BY JEAN NAINCHRICK

4
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,649
AUGUST 17, 1998

5
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,360
MINERS' HOUSING,
HYUPSEONG, WOONGSAN

6
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,380
We received a report of a child screaming.

7
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,133
May I take a look inside?

8
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,679
My son just never listens to me.

9
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,141
I raised my voice a bit,
and he begged for forgiveness, crying.

10
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,392
Satisfied?

11
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,894
We've received several reports.

12
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,562
I already told you.

13
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,525
That goddamn brat just never listens
to a single word I say.

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,111
So what?

15
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,322
Are you going to take him and raise him?

16
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,283
Sir, there's no need for all that.

17
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,624
<i>Unless it involved a flagrant offender,</i>

18
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>the police lack authority</i>
<i>to compel an investigation.</i>

19
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,713
<i>Refusal to answer questions</i>
<i>isn't punishable under any provision.</i>

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,349
It's this way, sir.

21
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,571
They said a little kid

22
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,115
was discovered staring at the body.

23
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,742
With a smile on his face.

24
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,724
Now, let's go to the police station.

25
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,892
Okay.

26
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,934
You can follow me.

27
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,580
POLICE

28
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,502
What were you doing
around 7 p.m. last night?

29
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,216
I left work around six, and…

30
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,719
I took a shower and got ready for dinner.

31
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,679
- What your wife mentioned…
- Yes, that's right.

32
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,788
The signal is strong.

33
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,958
Once the hostage exchange is completed,

34
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,334
all units will move in.

35
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,294
All units, around the mountain.

36
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,712
No, that can't happen.

37
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,298
The safety of the hostage
hasn't been secured yet.

38
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,968
Once it is, then they can swarm in.

39
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,595
All will stand by
and await further command.

40
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,807
Let me repeat. All will stand by
and await further command.

41
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:33,982
Hyuk.

42
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,819
Circle behind the mountain and search
Mine Number Two from the back now.

43
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:38,820
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

44
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,531
Maintain a clear field of vision,
and keep yourself concealed.

45
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,077
Where are they?

46
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,936
We have a full house.

47
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,163
As soon as the exchange happens,
our units will move in.

48
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,790
Take your shot
as soon as Jung-yeon is safe.

49
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,542
What?

50
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,438
Wait.

51
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,528
Go. Run.

52
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,408
Mother.

53
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,701
Thank you.

54
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,504
Hey, Mom.

55
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,806
Move it.

56
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,977
Exchange complete.

57
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,521
<i>Jung-yeon is safe.</i>

58
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,480
Let's move in.

59
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,441
Su-yeol.

60
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,359
Jung-yeon.

61
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,280
Run.

62
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,698
Run if you don't want to die.

63
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,628
- Jung-yeon.
- Safety first. Take it slow.

64
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,481
Take off the tracker first.

65
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,744
We lost the tracker signal.

66
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,871
What?

67
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,456
What's the last known location?

68
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,542
Don't pretend to be weak.

69
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,793
Keep walking.

70
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,255
The police couldn't care less
if I live or die.

71
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,632
You're right.

72
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,096
What the fuck?

73
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,730
I'll check it out.

74
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,607
You head to the hospital.

75
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,656
Those fucking pricks.

76
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,330
Fuck.

77
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,043
Run. You need to run.

78
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,425
Jung-yeon.

79
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,428
You'll be okay.
We'll be at the hospital soon.

80
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,972
What about Mother?

81
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,618
Arrived at the miners' rest area.
No one to report.

82
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,746
Hey, guys. Keep up the good work.

83
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,290
I checked over there already.

84
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>How can we trust Jeong I-shin's son?</i>

85
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,795
<i>Return to the office now!</i>

86
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,924
The test result came back positive

87
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,635
for mifepristone, an abortion drug.

88
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,262
But fortunately,

89
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,015
it was a small amount. You should be fine.

90
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,474
What about the baby?

91
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,892
Shall we take a look?

92
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,607
That's the baby's heartbeat.

93
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,902
Its heartbeat…

94
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,001
Su-yeol.

95
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,756
Your mother kept trying to protect me.

96
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,050
Wait.

97
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,011
Go.

98
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,180
Run.

99
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,518
Take your shot
as soon as Jung-yeon is safe.

100
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,232
Jung-yeon.

101
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,820
By any chance, do you remember anything?

102
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,074
The spot where you were held captive.

103
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,165
There was this strong,
sickening metallic smell in the air.

104
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,379
I heard creaking sounds.

105
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,840
It looked like some storage room
without any windows.

106
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,594
There were machine parts around.

107
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,348
And I remember seeing

108
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,683
<i>the word, "Start"…</i>

109
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,729
Anything else?

110
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,814
Well…

111
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,527
<i>"King"?</i>

112
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,405
I remember reading
something ending with "king" on the wall.

113
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,615
And the floor

114
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,034
<i>felt like really old cement.</i>

115
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,621
Yeah, I remember feeling cement powder.

116
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,039
I'm sure of it.

117
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,626
Su-yeol.

118
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,963
Go and find Mother.

119
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,256
Ah-ra…

120
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,591
She's completely insane.

121
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,053
Mother is in danger.

122
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,855
You just had to bring the police with you.

123
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,400
Listen.

124
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,777
I was so disappointed.

125
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,947
The old, feeble Mantis is now reduced

126
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,324
to the pitiful task
of fretting over her damn kid.

127
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,869
Is your son that important?

128
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:26,954
I mean,

129
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,415
what do you even know about
your son anyway?

130
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,293
Your son bent over backwards
to pretend like you didn't exist.

131
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,003
Then again,

132
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,254
it wasn't just your son.

133
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,841
The whole world doesn't know you exist.

134
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,926
They all forgot about you.

135
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,137
You should give it a go.

136
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,848
It'll bring you such peace.

137
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,975
It's pretty nice.

138
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
No.

139
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,897
I am the only one

140
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,690
who hasn't forgotten about you.

141
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,610
I am also the only one

142
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,777
who finds you commendable.

143
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,905
It was you who removed my dad,

144
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,574
the man who used to sear my nose
to "cast the demons away,"

145
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,492
from my life.

146
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,286
You punished every despicable beast
you came across.

147
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,789
It was just so freaking cool.

148
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,083
I was obsessed with you.

149
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,002
It was as if…

150
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,088
you were Joan of Arc

151
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,841
carrying around Medusa's head.

152
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,344
So I followed in your footsteps.

153
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,180
I modeled myself after you.

154
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,098
I am you.

155
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,642
You made me.

156
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,853
So please, take some responsibility.

157
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,105
Mom.

158
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,527
Why did you do it?

159
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,612
What?

160
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,781
Hey.

161
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,909
At the very least,
you should've shown me some love.

162
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,078
My dad thought I was a monster,

163
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,371
but you saved me!

164
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,331
Why did you act so irresponsibly?

165
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,553
Doesn't it get so lonely?

166
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,014
Living as a monster…

167
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,853
You can never go back home.

168
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,697
It's okay.

169
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,991
I'll embrace you.

170
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,994
I understand you.

171
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,330
We are creatures

172
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,250
who can never return to society.

173
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,670
The line drawn by shitty society…

174
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,922
We've crossed it so long ago.

175
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,718
Who even knows when and how we did that?

176
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,267
I know

177
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,397
Just like you,

178
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,276
I have nowhere to go.

179
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,045
So let's make sure

180
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,881
we don't betray each other.

181
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,175
Mom.

182
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,162
Don't kid yourself.
I'm not the one who betrayed you.

183
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,374
What?

184
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,793
You searched for prey as Jo-i on an app.

185
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,337
You never looked elsewhere to hunt.

186
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,464
So goddamn lazy.

187
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,341
After you killed your prey,

188
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,011
you couldn't even do the bare minimum
and delete their profiles.

189
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,932
You let down your hair
for the cops to climb.

190
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,392
You have no one to blame

191
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,811
except yourself
for letting that hair drag.

192
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,730
Is that so? Fuck.

193
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,774
The police are on their way.

194
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,235
Thanks to your bloody footsteps.

195
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,281
What's this?

196
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,534
Are you worried about me?

197
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,289
Yeon-joong.

198
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,838
Did you drag me all the way here
just to profess your love for me?

199
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,508
You're running out of time.

200
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,677
This is your one chance

201
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,178
if you want to kill me.

202
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,304
Go on.

203
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,019
Is that so?

204
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,604
Fine.

205
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,863
You and I both die here.

206
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,156
Is that what you're proposing?

207
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,912
You know, I just thought about it.

208
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,081
Yeah, this sort of ending…

209
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,167
It's not a bad idea.

210
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,960
At the end of the day,

211
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,964
with you by my side, nothing scares me.

212
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,310
Damn it.

213
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,062
That stings.

214
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,676
What are you looking for?

215
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,386
Save your breath.

216
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,097
You don't have long.

217
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,933
Oh, I get it.

218
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,769
The full Mantis treatment at last,
carved alive with my breath intact.

219
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,164
If the police arrive a bit early,

220
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,083
you might make it.

221
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,129
It won't be easy, though.

222
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,131
Where are you going?

223
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,508
Don't go.

224
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,927
Are you going to abandon me?

225
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,556
I don't believe Joan of Arc
beheaded Medusa.

226
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,850
Who the hell cares who did it?

227
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,894
You'll grow cold quite quickly
when you lose a lot of blood.

228
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
I saw all of them

229
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,773
tremble so.

230
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,320
Are you going back to prison? Why?

231
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,197
Why the hell would you do that?

232
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,201
Don't go.

233
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,204
Please don't go back.

234
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,249
There's a way out
the police don't know about.

235
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,292
I know where it is.

236
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,211
I'll make sure you get out of here
without getting caught.

237
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,130
I'll show you.

238
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,257
I can give you freedom.

239
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,217
So please…

240
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,970
Stop trying to run away already.

241
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,602
It'd be a hassle.

242
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,937
I'll take the main road.

243
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,370
Open it.

244
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,401
Didn't I tell you?

245
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
I know you through and through.

246
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,865
See.

247
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,700
I didn't forget.

248
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,182
A storage room for machine parts?

249
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,100
ANTICIPATED ROUTE

250
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,228
There's no such facility near the mines.

251
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,024
What about here?

252
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,069
What was this area used for?

253
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,195
Oh, that?

254
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,031
They built an amusement park there
when the mines were doing well.

255
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,492
It's been shut down for a while now.

256
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,494
I'm not sure you'll find anything there.

257
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,545
<i>I remember reading</i>
<i>something ending with "king" on the wall.</i>

258
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,546
"King."

259
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,216
"Viking"?

260
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
CHA SU-YEOL
POLICE AGENCY

261
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,324
You're one step too late.

262
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,868
Jeong I-shin just left.

263
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,621
There's a secret passageway, you see.

264
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,665
Where could she have gone?

265
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,958
Back to prison?

266
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,043
Give up.

267
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,545
Even if you shoot me now,

268
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,838
you'll be caught in the end.

269
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,257
Everyone's headed here.

270
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,800
Tell me

271
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,761
where Jeong I-shin went.

272
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,555
Cha Su-yeol.

273
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,183
You know so little about Jeong I-shin.

274
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,150
And I guess you'll die ignorant.

275
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,609
Goodbye, Cha Su-yeol.

276
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,385
Detective Kim!

277
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,894
Where's Jeong I-shin?

278
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,188
She's not here.

279
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,355
She's disappeared.

280
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,358
She escaped through a secret passageway.

281
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,278
- But first--
- Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

282
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,198
Go and catch Jeong I-shin.

283
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,284
Go and bring her back.

284
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,287
I'll be sure to.

285
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,359
DON'T FORGET YOUR FAMILY
WANTS YOU TO PUT SAFETY FIRST

286
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,171
LEADING COAL INDUSTRY INNOVATION!
EAST MINE SHAFT

287
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,178
Set one up all the way over there.

288
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,554
And check this area.

289
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,517
Wait, Kim.

290
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,686
Are you okay?

291
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,813
Are you sure you're okay?

292
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,147
- Wait.
- Yeah?

293
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,818
- Ji-an, I'm going to go with her.
- Yes?

294
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,902
Call the chief now.

295
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
- Update him on the situation.
- Okay.

296
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,285
Kang Yeon-joong, the culprit
behind the serial murders,

297
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,121
was shot dead by the police
at the end of their relentless pursuit.

298
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,373
<i>The motive</i>
<i>is currently being investigated.</i>

Su-yeol?

304
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,165
<i>How's Detective Kim?</i>

305
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,251
Her surgery went well. She's stable.

306
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,004
An off-the-record APB
has been issued for you two.

307
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,673
You know, don't you?

308
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,841
<i>Don't worry.</i>

309
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,344
I will bring that woman back.

310
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,428
<i>Where are you?</i>

311
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,971
<i>You don't need to do it alone.</i>

312
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,806
Let's find her together. Okay?

313
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,186
<i>Sir.</i>

314
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,689
<i>Why were you so lenient with her?</i>

315
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,941
<i>And with me?</i>

316
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,988
<i>I understand that was the deal negotiated.</i>

317
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:39,699
But even so…

318
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,206
I've always wondered about that.

319
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,667
<i>Why did you do all that?</i>

320
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,761
<i>On a human level,</i>

321
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,641
I never thought
what Jeong I-shin did was wrong.

322
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,687
<i>Why not?</i>

323
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,148
You're a cop.

324
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,485
<i>I was only a cop</i>

325
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,824
when I caught her
and boasted about such achievements.

326
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,867
<i>I failed everywhere else.</i>

327
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,745
<i>Within the bounds of the law,</i>

328
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,706
<i>I wanted to make her life easier.</i>

329
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,751
My personal feelings toward her

330
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,631
created a rift within my heart.

331
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,467
<i>And that rift</i>

332
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,387
<i>led me to make that choice.</i>

333
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,182
When I look at you now,

334
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,602
I think I made the right decision.

335
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,856
Pull yourself together, Mister.

336
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,817
Jeong I-shin

337
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,154
is just another murderer.

338
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,408
<i>Her victims just happened</i>
<i>to be criminals themselves.</i>

339
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,911
<i>We failed to stop any crimes</i>
<i>or save anyone.</i>

340
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,207
<i>Whether it's one person or five,</i>

341
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,043
<i>it is the police's job</i>

342
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,045
<i>to save lives.</i>

343
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,923
At times, we may fail
and fall into cowardice,

344
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,178
but in the end, it's up to us.

345
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,722
It's up to the police.

346
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,475
Su-yeol.

347
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,560
It seems you grew overly sentimental

348
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,021
while stalling to allow tracking.

349
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,732
<i>Old geezer.</i>

350
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,734
POWER OFF

351
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,826
<i>Cha Su-yeol.</i>

352
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,995
You know so little

353
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,997
about Jeong I-shin.

354
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,565
Peek-a-boo.

355
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,443
I came here on the off chance,
and you're here.

356
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,904
Detective Bae.

357
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,197
Why are you at Kang's house?

358
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,698
You think you'll find something?

359
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,575
Will it help you find Jeong I-shin?

360
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,912
Yes, wait… What about Detective Kim?

361
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,831
She lucked out. She's surprisingly fine.

362
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,544
What kind of spell
did you put on her, anyway?

363
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,712
As soon as she woke up, she told me

364
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,506
to go and help you out.

365
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,342
Let's give it a go.

366
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,429
I'll work my magic
and get you that opening.

It's freezing out here.

368
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,518
Hey.

369
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,812
You guys had dinner, right?

370
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,146
Not yet.

371
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,901
The culprit has been caught.
They're making you suffer for nothing, no?

372
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,361
The homeowner is dead.

373
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,989
Come on. Let's go.

374
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,740
Let's grab some dinner.

<i>Let yourself release all tension.</i>

380
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,830
<i>There is a window.</i>

381
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,668
<i>We're going to open that window now.</i>

382
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,797
<i>There is another world</i>
<i>outside that window.</i>

383
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,467
<i>It is beyond the conscious.</i>

384
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,013
<i>On the far side of awareness.</i>

385
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,475
<i>It is the world of the subconscious.</i>

386
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,604
<i>You will now lift your hand</i>

387
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,316
<i>and slowly open that window.</i>

388
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,194
<i>I don't want to.</i>

389
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,489

00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,754
<i>The sky is dark.</i>

395
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,925
<i>It's nighttime, but there's a bird flying.</i>

396
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,096
<i>It's weird. The sun is up,</i>

397
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,931
<i>but it's dark.</i>

398
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,975
<i>No.</i>

399
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,937

400
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,481
<i>Even stars.</i>

401
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,485
<i>I just look at them.</i>

402
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,529
<i>I…</i>

403
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,532
<i>I'm just going to keep looking at them.</i>

404
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,618
<i>Why do you only look at them?</i>

405
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,249
<i>No, that's my choice.</i>
<i>I'm just going to look at them.</i>

406
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,379
<i>Last night, in my dreams</i>

407
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,217
<i>I put on wings</i>

408
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:41,472
<i>and flew up higher than the clouds</i>

409
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,600
<i>as I soared up into the sky</i>

410
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,561
<i>I smell it.</i>

411
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,106
<i>It put something on my face.</i>

412
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,651
<i>Makeup.</i>

413
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,404
<i>Why do you think that happened?</i>

414
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,866
<i>It says I'm a grown-up.</i>

415
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:06,497
<i>No. I see the sun,</i>
<i>the moon, and the stars.</i>

416
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,374
<i>I'm flying.</i>

417
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,335
<i>I'm flying.</i>

418
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,214
I fly away and away.

419
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,676
I fly away to flee.

420
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,969
<i>From what?</i>

421
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,554
That thing.

422
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,313
That thing killed my mother.

423
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,235
That thing burned my mother to death.

424
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,112
<i>What is…</i>

425
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,198
<i>"that thing"?</i>

426
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,701
That thing is touching me.

427
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,912
<i>Can you tell me what "that thing" is?</i>

428
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,051

Hey, Dad.

433
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,576
It's been a while.

434
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,252
My beautiful daughter.

435
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,005
It's because

436
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,507
Daddy loves you so much.

437
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,929
What is going on here?

438
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,516
What did you do?

439
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,101
How can you even call yourself human?

440

I-shin…

441
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,480
My poor I-shin.

442
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,025
She's your daughter!

443
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,526
You're scum.

444
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,528
What did you do to your daughter?

445
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,988
I didn't do anything. Damn it.

446
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,323
You scum.

447
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,992
How could you do that to I-shin?

448
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:48,909
Come here.

449
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,286
- Let go of me!
- Come here.

450
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,871
I-shin.

451
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:52,955
I-shin!

452
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,124
Let go of me, you bastard!

453
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,208
Let go!

454
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,003
- Let go. I-shin!
- Come here!

455
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,547
I'm going to report you to the police.

456
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,631
Why you…

457
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,980
I-shin…

458
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,484

JUSIN CHURCH
THANK YOU, PASTOR JEONG HYUN-NAM

463
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,095
Back then,

464
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,931
as our house was burning down,

465
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,266
you told me,

466
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,852
"Now that Mom's gone,

467
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,521
from now on,

468
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,399
you have to take over for her."

469
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,152
Why are you doing this?

470
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,321
It has been over 20 years.

471
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,997
I did you wrong.

472
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,209
I have prayed for forgiveness endlessly.

473
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,795
And after countless hours
of praying to the Lord,

474
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,423
I received my calling from him.
That's how I became a pastor.

475
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,925
And for the sake of repentance,

476
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,844
I took in poor kids who had nowhere to go.

477
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,139
I changed every dirty diaper,
and raised them all by myself!

478
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,267
Did you raise them

479
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,019
the way you raised me?

480
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,146
No, that didn't happen.

481
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,564
I am a servant of the Lord.

482
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,232
That never happened with them.

483
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,860
I was forgiven.

484
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,780
Killing me

485
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,907
won't undo the past.

486
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,454
The Lord has forgiven me.

487
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,788
He even forgave you.

488
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,457
You have been forgiven as well.

489
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,542
What choice do we have?

490
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,127
We only have our bloodline to blame.

491
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,088
We have been forgiven.

492
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,923
We are clean now.

493
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,051
It's not because of that damn bloodline!

494
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,261
Not that damn bloodline!

495
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,305
It's you.

496
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,600
You just did it because you wanted to.

497
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,894
Forgiveness?

498
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,853
Who would dare?

499
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,937
Forgive who?

500
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,105
How dare they?

501
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,775
Even after I killed
all those repugnant pieces of shit,

502
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,735
I have never once

503
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,071
even dreamt about being forgiven.

504
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,323
How dare you?

505
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,159
Who the hell are you
to expect forgiveness from anyone?

506
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,668
Please spare me.

507
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,879
Please spare me.

508
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,468
Dear daddy,

509
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,637
let's just end it here.

510
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,765
It's time you and I

511
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,810
put an end to all of this.

512
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,562
Stop!

513
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,860
Don't move.

514
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,654
Put down the knife.

515
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,406
Put it down!

516
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,618
Step back.

517
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,869
Su-yeol.

518
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,829
Su-yeol, you must act now.

519
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,831
You must shoot this demonic wench now.

520
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,335
You can do that, right?

521
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,130
Shut up.

522
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,758
You can still spew such bullshit?

523
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,134
You!

524
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,679
You told me the same thing every day.

525
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,180
"Your mother is the devil."

526
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,184
"Your mother is possessed
by an evil spirit."

527
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,644
I believed those words

528
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,771
and that's why!

529
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,608
Su-yeol, that's a misunderstanding.

530
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,361
I did that for your sake.

531
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,529
Shut it.

532
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,739
Or I can shoot you right now.

533
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,789
Let's go.

534
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,083
Come with me.

535
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,794
Don't let

536
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,882
those hands see more blood.

537
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,721
Please.

538
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,659
Su-yeol, hurry up and get her out of here.

539
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,076
- Why?
- No, it's not true.

540
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,577
- You can't.
- Su-yeol.

541
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,872
No, she did it because she wanted to.
She was curious.

542
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,915
Su-yeol, you can't.

543
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,628
Don't become like me.

544
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,138
Please don't.

545
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,101
You can't, Su-yeol.

546
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,189
You can't cross that line.

547
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,945
Su-yeol, wake up!

548
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,363
Su-yeol!

549
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,281
You need to save me!

550
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,533
Su-yeol!

551
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,201
- Be quiet.
- You're a cop!

552
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,994
- You talk too much.
- Su-yeol!

553
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,746
- It's over. Be quiet!
- Su-yeol!

554
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,081
Why are you so noisy?

555
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,834
Just be quiet already.

556
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,968
Stop talking!

557
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,806
We have caused that kid

558
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,851
way too much suffering already.

THANK YOU, PASTOR JEONG HYUN-NAM

561
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,406
You go outside.

562
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,044
<i>Mom!</i>

563
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,171
Mom!

564
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,380
Mom!

565
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,801
Mom!

566
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,843
Eun-ae, get back in the house. Go on.

567
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,595
Quickly.

568
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,915

Jeong I-shin.

570
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,238
Jeong I-shin!

571
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,449
Wake up, Jeong I-shin!

572
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,092
Jeong I-shin.

573
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,009
Wake up.

574
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,594
Jeong I-shin!

575
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,931
You can't leave like this.

576
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,185
Mom.

577
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,979
Mom!

578
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,816
Please don't leave me.

579
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,443
Please.

580
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,529
Wake up!

581
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,783
Mom.

582
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,332
Are you okay?

583
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,711
Take a deep breath.

584
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,321
JUSIN CHURCH

585
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,013
Jung-yeon and I'll come to visit.

586
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,599
They should allow visits.

587
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,770
Don't. Forget me.

588
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,189
Just live your life as you always have.

589
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,569
I'll still come for a visit.

590
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:38,822
You're my mom.

591
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,660
Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

592
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,745
You got it all wrong.

593
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,958
Bloodlines are meaningless.

594
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,920
How you lived your life is what matters.

595
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,631
You led a life different from mine.

596
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,260
You made an effort
and became a police officer

597
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,345
to save lives.

598
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,266
Each step left its mark on you.

599
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,518
So…

600
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,647
you're not like me at all.

601
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,320
I like that about you.

602
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,815
Eun-ae.

603
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,448
Jung-yeon's condition improved

604
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,116
and she's been discharged. Go home to her.

605
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,495
Okay.

606
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,663
Ms. Jeong I-shin.

607
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,208
I'll be escorting you to prison.

608
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,876
Let's go.

609
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,391
Captain Cha.

610
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,518
You're certainly a man of your word.

611
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,853
CHA SU-YEOL
POLICE AGENCY

612
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,566
Did you come all this way
to confirm that? In that state?

613
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,902
I guess I did.

614
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,073
Thanks.

615
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,909
I heard you asked
Detective Bae to help me.

616
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,370
No need. We're all on the same team.

617
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,916
But, who's this?

618
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,877
She'll be coming with me.

619
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,849
There will be some commotion for a while.

620
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,809
And…

621
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:16,229
the benefits you've received until now
and the rest of your conditions

622
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,189
will be rescinded.

623
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,944
And you'll be questioned
on suspicion of parricide.

624
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,155
Yes.

625
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,614
I understand.

626
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,160
Chief Choi.

627
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,871
Inherent compassion.

628
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,874
Tender mercy.

629
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,336
Jeong-ho possesses such traits.

630
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,009
You kept your promise to me.

631
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,553
Thank you.

632
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,432
I didn't do much.

633
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,393
He raised himself.

634
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,479
And I managed

635
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,522
to get this for you.

636
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,816
A photo of Su-yeol.

637
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,570
When he was a freshman in high school,

638
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:08,281
one of his classmates was disabled.

639
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,743
That classmate was being bullied in class…

640
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,453
My goodness.

641
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,789
That was quite a detour.

642
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,836
Detective Kim.
You should return to the hospital now.

643
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,546
Don't you dare

644
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,673
have a team dinner without me
just because I'm gone.

645
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,760
Gosh. That would never happen.

646
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,805
Detective Bae without Detective Kim?
That'd be unbearable.

647
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,473
Hey, watch it.

648
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,766
I quit alcohol.

649
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,392
I'm reborn now.

650
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,064
What's your name?

651
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,607
Eun-ae.

652
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,776
Do you want to come with me?

653
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,255
<i>They say while I was gone,</i>

654
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,509
<i>Su-yeol tried to protect</i>
<i>the weak around him.</i>

655
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,720
<i>Even without your mom,</i>

656
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,222
<i>you grew up strong,</i>

657
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,682
<i>to stand on your own.</i>

658
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,061
<i>Take care,</i>

659
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,147
<i>Inspector Cha Su-yeol.</i>

660
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,025
<i>All my questions about you</i>

661
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,779
<i>have been answered now.</i>

662
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,205
2 YEARS LATER

00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,249
ANWON PRISON,
ANWON, GYEONGGI PROVINCE

664
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,586
<i>Previously, Park had even proposed</i>
<i>doing it as a live broadcast.</i>

665
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,797
<i>The two sides have agreed to present</i>
<i>just their opening statements.</i>

666
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,091
<i>Their agenda is</i>
<i>to be arranged at a later date.</i>

667
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,178
<i>All eyes are on whether</i>
<i>the repeatedly postponed meeting</i>

668
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,639
<i>between the party leaders</i>
<i>will finally materialize.</i>

669
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,557
<i>On to the next story.</i>

670
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,852
<i>Around 2 a.m. yesterday,</i>
<i>a local resident discovered</i>

671
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:05,023
<i>a heavily mutilated body in a mountain</i>
<i>near Sinyang-dong, Seoul.</i>

672
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,150
<i>The body was identified</i>

673
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,527
<i>as Chief Superintendent Choi Jung-ho</i>
<i>of Sanghyeon Police.</i>

674
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,613
<i>He was known</i>
<i>for his significant contribution</i>

675
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,908
<i>to the arrest of Kang Yeon-joong,</i>
<i>the culprit behind the Nodu Stream Murder,</i>

677
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,662
<i>The body was transported to the NFS…</i>

678
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,289
Inmate 2067, you have a visitor.

679
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,876
- Come out.
- <i>Through today's press conference…</i>

680
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,610
What happened?

681
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,747
And then, proceed to…

682
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,381
"I'll be in touch."

683
