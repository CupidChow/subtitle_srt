00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Book continues from above.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,420
In the previous book, it was said that

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,010
Hu Tianming, the son of Supervisor Hu,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,800
died in a battle for the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,610
Hu's wife was bewitched by Demonic Cult and tried to resurrect her beloved son.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,840
Feng Erma bought the corpse of Sun Laoqi

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,470
was entrusted by Hu's wife.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,240
Lian Huaqing instructed Hu's wife

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,960
to perform a magic of refining corpse in the Nine Evils Land.

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,000
So Mrs. Hu went to the ghost market to buy dead bodies.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,300
In order to sneak into the consulate,

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,760
she cooperated with the Door of Life

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,930
to subvert the Grain Transportation.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,689
The dead bodies in the consulate suddenly mutated.

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,870
Ten dead bodies were resurrected one after another.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,410
There was a mess in the consulate

18
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,460
Lian Huaqing sneaked into the crowd and took the opportunity to escape.

19
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,070
Hu Tianming caught Ding Mao.

20
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,670
In order to save Ding Mao,

21
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,130
Mrs. Hu died with her beloved son.

22
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,420
Guo Deyou and others escaped successfully.

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,980
Ding Mao felt desolate when he read Mrs. Hu's letter.

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,010
Guo Deyou went into prison with the help of Xiao Lanlan.

25
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,530
Ding Mao and Captain Fu also tracked down here.

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,430
At this time,

27
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,330
Huang Yu used the Art of Soft Bones

28
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,480
to escape from Xiaoxiguan prison.

29
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,340
This leads out that

30
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,540
Huang Yu got out of trouble, and the preacher was missing .

31
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,800
Captain Fu put himself at risk, and Ding Dashao saved the beauty.

32
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,460
Yu Si shows his spirit

33
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,830
and went to the prison to kill and rub.

34
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,570
This black tea

35
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,650
was brought to me by my British friend.

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,579
Foreign stuff.

37
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,829
What kind of things

38
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,220
matches what kind of person.

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
I am a rude man.

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,940
I can't taste if it's good or bad.

41
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,890
Only when a distinguished guest

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,650
like Miss Xiao came,

43
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,590
I would take it out

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,650
for a taste.

45
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,800
You just said,

46
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,170
what kind of things matches what kind of person.

47
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,700
Then should we have a special prison cell

48
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,860
for this special prisoner?

49
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
It's interesting for foreigners to drink black tea.

50
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,460
They add sugar to it.

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,330
The sugar is put in the tea,

52
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,980
how to drink it when it becomes sweet?

53
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,240
Then I'll be straightforward.

54
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,860
Special Needs Cells.

55
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,290
Miss Xiao.

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,440
How do you know this?

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,070
Time has passed so long.

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,500
For such an important prisoner,

59
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,210
we must ensure that this Special Needs Cells

60
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,240
is foolproof

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,360
and that there is nothing wrong with it.

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
Please don't worry.

63
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,810
The Special Needs Cells

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
are made of special materials.

65
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,909
We will check it regularly.

66
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,920
It is absolutely no problem.

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,880
What is the condition of the inmate?

68
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,110
He's still the same,

69
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,330
and don't let us approach him.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,450
He has food and water,

71
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,320
he will not die.

72
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,530
Don't let you approach him?

73
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,840
The superiors have regulations,

74
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,350
the inmate can do sorcery.

75
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,810
No one is allowed to approach him.

76
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,120
You just said,

77
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,860
sorcery?

78
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,810
Yes.

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,900
Normal people can't meet him face-to-face.

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,890
Otherwise,

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,790
they will definitely be crazy.

82
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,860
Is it so bizarre?

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,030
I'm not talking nonsense.

84
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,900
Only a person who has a clear heart

85
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,140
and no distracting thoughts

86
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,470
will not be caught by his sorcery.

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,730
We had

88
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,950
a deaf and blind old man

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,000
who delivered food to him before.

90
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,930
He couldn't see or hear.

91
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,760
It was fine.

92
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,140
It's a pity that this old man

93
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,680
died some time ago.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,170
He died so bizarre,

95
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,250
his head was gone.

96
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,800
So we changed to a little girl.

97
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,710
The little girl has simple mind.

98
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,620
And the eyes of this demon

99
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,660
have been locked by us.

100
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,720
He can't open it.

101
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,700
Don't worry.

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,010
Another year since the separation.

103
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,770
Flying around and flying around.

104
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,340
Lend you two or three citrons.

105
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,430
Your old nest is incomplete.

106
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,390
Go to the soil and go to the grass.

107
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,490
Fix it while it is sunny.

108
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,659
It's so tired everyday.

109
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,340
I say,

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,870
it's time for you to exercise.

111
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,210
Who still exercise now?

112
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,700
They all depend on this.

113
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,830
You can only scare people with this stick.

114
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,010
I say,

115
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,300
what are you doing

116
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,200
after the mission?

117
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,350
Bet.

118
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Bet again?

119
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Have you earned the money back

120
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,680
you lost before?

121
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,400
No.

122
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,770
At night,

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,090
I want to go with you.

124
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,500
But,

125
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
I can't go directly.

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,060
I have to go home first

127
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,660
and tell my wife.

128
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,880
If I don't tell her

129
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,190
and leave all the time,

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,030
she has to fight with me at night.

131
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,060
Come in!

132
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,890
Someone has come outside,

133
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,800
please pick it up.

134
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,409
What's going on today?

135
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,760
Miss Xiao.

136
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,670
I'm really sorry.

137
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,700
Please wait here for a moment.

138
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,780
It's okay.

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Let's go.

140
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,790
Sorcery?

141
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,710
I have to go and meet him.

142
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,930
Do you know what this place is?

143
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,110
Don't act randomly.

144
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,040
Miss Xiao's help is finished.

145
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,960
Thank you.

146
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Captain Fu.

147
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,610
Please don't embarrass me.

148
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,270
I am going to interrogate a felon

149
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,940
with three lives.

150
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,820
It is very urgent.

151
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,260
Can you be responsible for delaying the case?

152
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,570
Can you hurry up?

153
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,270
OK, ok, ok. I'll open the door for you right now.

154
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,230
Captain Fu.

155
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,510
Who is this?

156
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,850
Why are you still talking nonsense?

157
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,560
Please.

158
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,590
You have gained such a heavy weight in vain.

159
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,230
I picked a laurel flower for you.

160
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,700
Does it look good?

161
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,659
It smells good.

162
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,470
Thank you, A Shuang.

163
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,300
It's a pity that my eyes were blindfolded,

164
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,180
so I can't see.

165
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,800
Why are your eyes blindfolded?

166
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,350
Because they are afraid to see my eyes.

167
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,530
What's so scary about eyes?

168
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,180
They feel that

169
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,070
I can see their hearts through my eyes.

170
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,220
I can see what they want and what they want to do.

171
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,600
They are hypocritical.

172
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,610
They are also dirty inside.

173
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,060
They are afraid of being seen clearly by me,

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,360
but they don't want to blindfold themselves.

175
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,240
So,

176
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,080
they covered my eyes.

177
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,470
Are the eyes so powerful?

178
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,370
The eyes can see bright

179
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,650
and beautiful things.

180
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,390
Unfortunately,

181
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,909
the bright is just an illusion.

182
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,850
If you look closely you will find that

183
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,890
the world itself is black.

184
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,350
You can't see anything.

185
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,850
Do you mean at night?

186
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,760
But we have lights at night.

187
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,040
Bright is not a light,

188
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,150
it is the kindness and beauty expressed by people.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,410
But these are all fake,

190
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,360
these are to protect themselves.

191
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,610
Only darkness is the truth.

192
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,110
Only in the darkness,

193
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,090
can people behave as they should be.

194
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,810
The world is an abyss.

195
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,450
How can the light of fireflies

196
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,880
illuminate the world.

197
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,480
But we have sun.

198
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,140
Come on, please.

199
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,610
I heard that

200
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,510
we have distinguished guests.

201
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,120
Captain Fu.

202
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,210
Chairman Ding.

203
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,600
Stop standing.

204
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,230
Have a sit.

205
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,950
Sit, sit, sit.

206
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,240
Today I'm very happy.

207
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,470
My Xiao Xiguan,

208
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,650
it is rare to have so many distinguished guests.

209
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,160
Drink some British black tea.

210
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,960
What kind of things matches what kind of person.

211
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,730
OK.

212
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,080
Wait a minute.

213
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,800
Reporter Xiao.

214
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,540
What major case are you looking at again?

215
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,320
I didn't.

216
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
I just came to ask some questions for my father.

217
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,570
Captain Fu, how about you?

218
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,270
I have nothing important to do.

219
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,240
I'm here to interrogate a prisoner

220
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,890
with Detective Ding

221
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,290
and ask a few questions.

222
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,460
Captain Fu is really responsible.

223
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,950
Sure, it's my job.

224
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,960
Black tea is coming.

225
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,310
You have waited a long time.

226
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,100
Come on, come on.

227
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,560
Miss Xiao, where is your Assistant Guo?

228
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,310
He went to the bathroom.

229
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
OK, ok.

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,640
Come in.

231
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,980
Guo Deyou?

232
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,780
Why do you come to make trouble

233
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,580
when I have guests here?

234
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,160
The little girl who delivered food to the Special Needs Cells never came back.

235
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,580
Captain Fu.

236
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,160
Don't you want to interrogate Huang Yu in a while?

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,730
I will ask this police officer to go with you.

238
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,050
I have a temporary situation here.

239
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,250
I will deal with it first.

240
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,110
Please forgive me

241
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,810
for not taking good care of you.

242
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,530
Go ahead, go ahead.

243
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,000
Go.

244
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,280
Captain Fu, this way please.

245
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,270
I haven't drunk this black tea...

246
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,650
Let's go.

247
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,620
Wait a minute.

248
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,180
Miss Xiao, are you in a hurry?

249
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,790
We will be back soon.

250
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,090
Let's continue to

251
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,750
taste this black tea later.

252
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,350
Is Guo Deyou here?

253
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,360
Go, go, go.

254
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,320
Captain Fu.

255
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,130
Hang Yu is locked up here.

256
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,280
Better keep some distance.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,720
All right.

258
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm the one who caught him.

259
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,800
Open it.

260
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,720
Where is he?

261
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,320
I’m asking you. Where is he?

262
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,000
I… I don’t know.

263
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,960
Could this be the wrong room?

264
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,140
Impossible!

265
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,160
There’s only one key.

266
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,990
How could he escape?

267
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,540
I…

268
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,840
Well, this…

269
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,120
Useless!

270
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,740
The Goldsand streams in gold bound.

271
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,660
From Kunlun mountains jade is found.

272
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,070
When clouds are formed, the rain is made.

273
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,740
When dew drops freeze, the frost is laid.

274
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,840
The best of swords is Giant’s Might.

275
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,100
The best of pearls is Bright-at-night.

276
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,190
I knew it was you!

277
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,069
Guo Deyou?

278
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,990
You came for Huang Yu too?

279
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,910
He’s gone.

280
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,390
I… I told you he was faking it!

281
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,710
Two guards were dead.

282
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,550
It must be him.

283
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,560
Dead?

284
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,500
Where are they?

285
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,930
In the changing room.

286
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,060
Wait!

287
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,800
You little bastard.

288
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,570
What are you doing here?

289
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,890
Who let you in?

290
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,910
Huang Yu must’ve been looking for the Preacher.

291
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,870
Who?

292
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,320
Dangerous prisoners like him

293
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,360
are locked in the special cell.

294
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,190
How do you know?

295
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,210
Where’s the special cell?

296
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,450
For God’s sake!

297
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,810
It’s a dangerous place.

298
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,230
This is none of your business.

299
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,380
Now get out of here with me.

300
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,130
Let’s go.

301
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,680
We have to find Huang Yu immediately.

302
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,240
And the Preacher.

303
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,590
I told you.

304
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,830
This is none of your business.

305
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,160
You,

306
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
have someone guard the exit.

307
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,230
I’ll call for backup.

308
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,080
Where’s the special cell?

309
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,240
Don’t tell them!

310
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,170
The longer you stall, the more people die.

311
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,930
Do you know the consequence

312
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,060
if the prisoners of the special cell get out?

313
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,060
Don’t tell them!

314
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,890
Go downstairs from the front passage.

315
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,360
The warden just went there.

316
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,480
Stop!

317
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,600
You are not leaving, right?

318
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,400
Fine.

319
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,540
I’ll arrest you for breaking into the jail.

320
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,120
You can stay here.

321
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,020
What’s going on?

322
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:14,790
Time for meal so soon?

323
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,420
You are crazy!

324
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,040
Those idiots!

325
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,920
What are you doing?

326
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,620
Come help!

327
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,600
Screw you!

328
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,170
Come on!

329
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,650
Open the door!

330
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,220
Lock it!

331
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,330
You stay here!

332
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,740
Guard the door!

333
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,490
We can’t stay here.

334
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,310
What should we do?

335
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,650
Freedom!

336
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,750
Freedom!

337
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,730
We are free!

338
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,670
Freedom!

339
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,800
Freedom!

340
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,520
Freedom!

341
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,800
We are free!

342
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,220
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

343
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,070
The Little Immortal?

344
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,810
Here you are.

345
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,900
I’m the ninth generation of Huang family.

346
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,320
As the descendant of the Colored Door,

347
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,080
you must’ve endured a lot to come this far.

348
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,780
I bet on my whole family.

349
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,670
Impressive.

350
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,640
I won’t stop

351
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,830
if I don’t get what I deserved.

352
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,800
Hello, my friend.

353
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,350
Sorry I can’t welcome you in person.

354
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,950
Kiddo,

355
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,590
can we just drop the gun first?

356
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,620
Calm down.

357
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,780
One step back.

358
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,660
She must be the girl who delivered the food.

359
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,900
Deliver the food?

360
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,740
The guard told me that

361
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,610
the Little Immortal can do some tricks.

362
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,990
Only people deaf and mute or

363
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,170
with a pure heart can come close to him.

364
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,850
She must be the one with a pure heart.

365
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,500
Hello, my friend.

366
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,050
Sorry I can’t welcome you in person.

367
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,010
I’m glad you are here.

368
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,480
The destiny has been written.

369
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,560
Fight for your fate.

370
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,740
This isn’t some trick. It’s hypnosis.

371
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,250
I hate chains!

372
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,310
Hypnosis?

373
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,470
She is now in a

374
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,110
strongly implied state.

375
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,610
Her every action

376
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,030
will change according to

377
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,530
what we say and do.

378
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,310
Someone said I was a fortune teller.

379
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,330
Where are you?

380
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,210
Clever.

381
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,280
Since you knew that

382
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,550
I’m not here,

383
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,670
then make a choice.

384
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,410
Truth always comes with choices.

385
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,670
When you opened the door,

386
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,730
the choices have already been laid before you.

387
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,780
If you choose to leave,

388
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,400
then this adorable little girl

389
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,730
will shoot herself.

390
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,760
If you choose to come in and save her,

391
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,330
she will shoot you.

392
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,110
The outcome

393
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,950
is up to you.

394
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,260
Don’t you know something about hypnosis?

395
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,910
Do something!

396
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,820
I only know some theories.

397
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,470
I don’t know what to do.

398
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,240
Maybe we just take a rest.

399
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,880
Let’s wait until she gets tired.

400
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,250
She said friend.

401
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,120
Not friends.

402
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,360
If one of us walks away,

403
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,140
she probably won’t move.

404
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,430
Go find the Little Immortal first.

405
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
I’ll stay with her.

406
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,140
Are you sure?

407
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,570
Oh, come on.

408
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,520
I’m the cleverest.

409
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,260
I’m good at getting along with little girls.

410
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,380
Then I’ll call someone for help.

411
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,320
I’ll come back for you.

412
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,060
I'm leaving now.

413
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,210
Stop there!

414
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,810
My leg!

415
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,370
What happened outside?

416
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,240
Someone released all the prisoners

417
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,080
We are outnumbered now

418
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,950
We can't hold them back anymore

419
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,900
How did the prisoners get released?

420
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,730
I've got no idea

421
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,240
It's a total chaos out there

422
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,830
We need to call for backup immediately

423
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,430
The wire has been cut off

424
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,520
We have to hide here for a while

425
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,860
Any water in the kettle? I'm thirsty

426
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,360
The water here has been drunk off

427
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,720
If you don't mind,

428
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,560
you can drink some over there

429
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,840
Didn't you just say

430
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,580
the wire has been cut off?

431
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,190
It's cut off now

432
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,730
It's good stuff

433
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,670
Don't ruin it

434
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,290
Tea

435
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,960
Hot tea

436
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,440
I've been having cold water for years

437
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,570
I forgot what tea tastes like for long

438
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,600
Let me go

439
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,840
Let me go

440
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,810
Let me go

441
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,760
It's already too noisy outside

442
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,290
Let's keep it down in here

443
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,020
Alright?

444
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:45,950
Ok

445
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,870
Let's have a peaceful talk

446
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,020
What do you want?

447
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,370
You can tell me

448
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,980
And I'll try my best to meet your needs

449
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,570
I've been locked up for too long

450
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,370
I'm in need for nothing else

451
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,190
But two things

452
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,490
Freedom

453
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,720
Women

454
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,650
Now that I've got these two things,

455
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,670
what else do I need?

456
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,770
What else do I need?

457
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,920
We're free! Let's go

458
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,380
We're free! Let's go

459
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,660
We're free! We're free

460
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,830
We're free! We're free

461
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,390
Young lady, if you lie here peacefully

462
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,770
This will be enjoyable

463
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,250
If you bump yourself

464
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,400
You'll just hurt yourself, right?

465
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,480
I promise you

466
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,420
I'll finish real quick

467
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,270
They say a gun will rust if not sharpened

468
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,420
Well, the "gun" on me

469
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,950
has rusted for many years

470
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,170
So

471
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,790
You have to let me sharpen it

472
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,970
Don't move

473
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,380
Your clothing is quite exquisite

474
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,230
It'll be a pity if we tear it off

475
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,050
I didn't cut your artery

476
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,610
Only your bronchus

477
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,150
If you don't want to die

478
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,650
Don't move

479
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,890
Are you all right?

480
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,490
Are you all right?

481
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:56,720
Lock the door

482
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,680
What

483
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,090
Lock the door

484
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,060
The British Embassy and the Xiao Xiguan Prison

485
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,470
should be the two places in Tianjin where

486
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,970
chaos is least likely to take place

487
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,730
But riots broke out one after another

488
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,100
This is my dereliction of duty

489
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,140
It's also the police office's responsibility

490
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,620
To encounter cases like this,

491
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,520
our lives as policemen have been worthwhile

492
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,110
We were late for the British Embassy

493
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,090
But we made it to the Xiao Xiguan Prison

494
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,020
Brothers,

495
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,040
let's risk everything

496
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,740
and subdue these outlaws

497
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,670
Ok

498
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,710
Do it, go on

499
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,120
Go on

500
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,610
Step aside

501
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,050
Caoyun's brothers

502
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:49,910
Yes!

503
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,120
Find the Young Master out for me

504
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,740
While the others,

505
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,250
you can kill them if you want

506
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,230
Beat them

507
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,570
Take it easy

508
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,030
Captain

509
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,360
Your backup arrived just in time

510
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,270
Brilliant

511
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,110
Nonsense

512
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,500
If I only have you dead dogs here

513
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,150
Can I trust you with this?

514
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,340
Captain, I've been working for you for such a long time

515
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,510
You still don't get me

516
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,450
Dizzy

517
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,310
Let's do it

518
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,230
I have a friend

519
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,920
A female friend

520
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,930
Back when she was your age,

521
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,940
she was a crazy girl

522
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,180
Generally speaking,

523
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,450
no one dared to bully her

524
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,040
She was the one bullying others

525
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,470
But her mother never let her run about

526
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,830
Especially to places like this

527
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,960
Do you know how many bad people are out there?

528
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,100
Master told me that

529
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,220
there were two men with a dog on the dock

530
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,210
The dog could speak and bow for money

531
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,210
And later,

532
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,470
the two were caught by the police

533
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,000
The public was very curious

534
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,010
What on earth was it about?

535
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,910
It turns out that

536
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,070
the two men were kidnappers

537
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,810
Once they kidnapped a kid,

538
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,830
they would soak their skin to rot in limewater

539
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,890
Then apply some liquid medicine and dog hair on them

540
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,140
And feed them some herbal medicine

541
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,370
As time passed by,

542
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,950
they grew their buckteeth and tails

543
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,000
No matter how restless my friend was,

544
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,940
as long as Master told this story to her,

545
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,010
she would stay at home obediently,

546
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,670
dare not to go anywhere

547
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,230
Seems like I have to take my chances
