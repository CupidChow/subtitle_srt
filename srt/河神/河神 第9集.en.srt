1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,140
Continuing from the last chapter, which said that

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,180
Ding Mao interrogated Shopkeeper Wang at night

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,500
and Supervisor Hu came to the police station to visit Ding Mao

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,590
After Hu had left

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,930
Ding Mao found Shopkeeper Wang

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,520
drowned in her cell mysteriously

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,880
Guo Deyou came by After some deduction

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,230
he told Ding Mao that he knew what happened

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,650
Xiao Lanlan found the origin of the bronze tortoise statue

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
and found out that Ding Yiqiu, Hu Haijiang and Guo Chun

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,220
led a troop and wiped out an evil organization

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,060
called the Magic Path twenty years ago

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,870
The Junior Tientsin Mystic used a fake story of Ding Mao being guilty

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,730
and discover the real killer Supervisor Hu

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,130
He confessed to commiting murder

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,800
but refused to say his motive

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,320
A the same time the Senior Tientsin Mystic Guo Chun went missing

19
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,200
and after that

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,430
Guo Deyou solved the case and Hu Haijiang pleaded guilty

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,690
Feng Erma's body was found at the wharf

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,640
and the Chamber of Commerce wanted to reason with The Door of Life

23
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,780
[Buddhist incantation] The Eye of Wisdom is forever constant

24
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,930
Please let the Deities think of me

25
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,490
The essence of Buddhism

26
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,660
Is to not deceive and make the right choice

27
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,290
Fairy Aunt

28
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't blame me when others create the trouble

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I will make sure to take care of it

30
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,840
Brother Guo

31
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,030
what took you so long?

32
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,200
What are you looking for?

33
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,180
Fairy Aunt where is my Master?

34
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,740
Guo Chun that old thing is gone?

35
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,680
Otherwise why would I ask you?

36
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,930
Brother, Uncle Guo never came

37
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,810
my mom doesn't know where he is either

38
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,000
Never came?

39
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,960
Where else can he be?

40
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,510
Does he like to drink with anyone?

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,460
Just your mom

42
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,320
The gambling house?

43
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,150
He complained about being poor

44
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,270
Could it be that he met someone?

45
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,260
Extreme bad luck!

46
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,820
Four up four middle four down

47
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,070
all bad luck!

48
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,380
This is Yin (negative) fortune

49
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,310
something bad will happen in the river!

50
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,810
Look, Red Badge Guard

51
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,640
nobody dares to mess with me

52
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,890
Focus on going abroad

53
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,460
study new skills and learn new things

54
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,710
You're naturally talented

55
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,330
much smarter than I am

56
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,220
I'll make sure that the Chamber of Commerce

57
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,220
does well

58
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,430
You can focus on your studies

59
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,800
and don't worry about anything else

60
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,870
When you come back

61
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,420
let's bring the Chamber of Commerce overseas

62
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,210
What do you think?

63
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,900
Tianming

64
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,310
stop fighting and killing all the time

65
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,580
A lot of people are interested in this grain transportation route

66
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,370
I am a Red Badge Guard

67
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,710
if I don't fight

68
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,680
it'll be occupied by others

69
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,470
Don't worry, nobody can win against me in Tientsin

70
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,460
Auntie Hu don't worry

71
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,450
the Chamber of commerce will treat Uncle Hu nicely

72
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,330
Tianming and Uncle Hu did it for the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

73
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,790
as long as its there

74
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,470
you won't be starved

75
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,120
Young Master I can't accept that

76
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,690
I know that I wasn't considerate enough regarding Uncle Hu

77
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,450
but life goes on

78
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,190
right?

79
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,550
Ever since Tianming left

80
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,160
I felt terrible every single day

81
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,350
He was fine when he left

82
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,670
but when he came back

83
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,270
his hands and feet were cold

84
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,880
and he was struck all over

85
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:37,880
After that

86
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,820
I stopped having decent conversations with Hu

87
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,400
because he reminds me of Tianming

88
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,800
Come on

89
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,760
The Chamber of Commerce let your family down

90
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,290
I let you down

91
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,490
Hu Haijiang is in charge of the Chamber of Commerce

92
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm not unreasonable

93
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,920
and I know that sacrificing one family

94
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,610
can bring good to everybody

95
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,690
But as a father and the man of this house

96
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,960
I blame him for what he did

97
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
I shouldn't say this but

98
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,750
I think you

99
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,040
are more like his son

100
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,850
A person often have many worries in his lifetime

101
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,680
In this world

102
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,230
happiness only lasts for an instance

103
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,280
it is sorrow and distress

104
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,750
that will last a lifetime

105
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,090
Young Master I need to speak with you

106
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,700
Our man got in trouble on The Door of Life's territory

107
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,330
Move move

108
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,720
Master Guo

109
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,210
Ku Zhu

110
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,560
His son

111
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,550
He works for the Chamber of Commerce

112
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,240
Doesn't this wharf belong to The Door of Life?

113
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,040
Who did it?

114
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,320
Whoever killed him show yourself!

115
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,950
Things have changed huh?

116
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,710
Yu Si is now in charge of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

117
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,730
Madman Cui, my guy is dead on your territory

118
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,930
and if you don't give me an explanation today

119
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,980
I will torn this place down

120
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,190
It has nothing to do with me

121
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,630
Blame someone else

122
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,530
and don't run wild on  my territory!

123
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,300
Our bothers will not allow it

124
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,110
and won't admit to it

125
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,700
Does it mean The Door of Life wants to follow another  master

126
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,810
another master?

127
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,560
Who dares to take over this shit show?

128
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,580
What do you want

129
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,250
The oldest one is dead

130
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,820
the second in line is in jail

131
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,380
and the Young Master is not in charge

132
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,580
The Chamber of Commerce is perhaps guilty of

133
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,080
too many things and angered the River Demon and now you have to pay

134
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,710
This is your own doing so don't blame it on others

135
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,020
You

136
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,540
The Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation belongs to us Dings

137
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,820
so their people

138
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,910
is our people

139
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,090
Although my father passed away

140
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,450
the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation is still here in charge

141
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,320
From this day onwards

142
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,940
all affairs of the Chamber be it major or minor

143
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,540
will count on me Ding Mao

144
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,680
Any one of you who killed this man

145
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,740
just stands out and admits it like a real man

146
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,050
we can handle it with legal procedures in harmony

147
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,460
or else I will teach you a good lesson if I find out the murderer

148
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
I won't wrong the good guys

149
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,390
neither will I let bad guys get way with it

150
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,500
Find it. If you can find out the murderer, I cooperate with you.

151
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,450
But if you don't

152
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,190
you make trouble at my wharf with no evidence

153
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,730
then you should give me a good explaination and solution

154
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,870
Or else none of you will get out of this wharf today

155
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,530
Make way Make way

156
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,610
Hurry up Step aside

157
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,430
Polices on duty Step aside Step aside

158
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,970
Get out of the way

159
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,310
Step aside

160
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,090
What interesting events are you busy discussing about

161
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,460
Is there any chance

162
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,070
for me to join you guys

163
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,930
Murder case

164
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,790
What do you say?

165
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,920
It's up to you

166
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,640
Whose employee is the man?

167
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,420
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

168
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,970
In your territoy?

169
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,190
Exactly My place for earning a living

170
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,890
Do you want to handle it privately or with legal procedures?

171
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,850
It involves us two sides

172
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,090
We can handle it ourselves

173
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,390
Good Withdraw

174
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,040
Muder case needs to take legal proceedings

175
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,630
Fine Take legal proceedings

176
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,110
It is agaisnt the law for mob fights

177
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,030
Sir Ding you know the law but you still violates it

178
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,870
Double guilty!

179
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,530
An employee of our Chamber died at the Door of Life

180
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,960
I bring my men to capture the murderer

181
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,130
Nonesence You have no evidence at all

182
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,560
You have brouhgt so many people here Don't you gather a crowd and make disturbances

183
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,310
It takes evidence to settle a case

184
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,569
Don't just talk

185
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,890
Show me something that really matters

186
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,760
Find out how Feng Erma died

187
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,700
What are you doing?

188
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,140
Autopsy

189
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,520
No You can't

190
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,980
Don't you know who he is?

191
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,410
Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

192
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,760
Isn't it obviously casting all the blame

193
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,480
on us the Door of Life?

194
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,910
Besides Captain Fu you see

195
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,940
you see the wound at the neck

196
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,420
It is apprently a bite of a mad dog

197
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,700
It maybe be the watchdog of the Chamber

198
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,030
They didn't keep the dog well

199
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,470
The dog bit and killed the man and they threw the corpse to my territory

200
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,770
It is a set-up

201
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,150
Bullshit

202
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,320
I think he was bitten by a mad dog like you

203
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,690
What? What are you doing?

204
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,310
Don't you respect my presence?

205
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,280
You are all grown-ups

206
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,940
Can you behave youselves?

207
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,790
You are everywhere boy

208
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,870
We should show our respect to the dead

209
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,010
A little kid just lost his father

210
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,720
and you are quarrelling and cursing in front of the corpse

211
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,590
Is it really appropriate

212
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,410
The Door of Life claims that they didn't kill anyone

213
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,060
But the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation doesn't believe it

214
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,760
Now Master Ding wants a autopsy

215
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,990
But the Door of Life doesn't agree

216
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,980
Captain Fu upholds justice and believes that evidence is key to settling a case

217
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,290
Even though all members of each party are gathering at the wharf

218
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,940
in my opinion

219
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,570
you still can't work out this confusing case

220
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,500
But you can't leave the corpse lying here

221
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,350
As far as I am concerned

222
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,250
the corpse is salvaged by our corpse retrieval team

223
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,910
so as usual the corpse should be carried to and placed in the Dragon King Temple

224
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,840
Today you boy plays a key role

225
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,510
Hurry up and carry the corpse

226
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
It is not appropriate to leave it here

227
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,060
No way No

228
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,710
Every one knows that you have a close relationship as fellow apprentices of the same master

229
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,600
Maybe you have already discussed and planned it

230
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,770
Captain Fu this man died at this place

231
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,190
The master of this place is here

232
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,270
The master and family of the dead are here

233
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,680
Now the police are here too

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,100
Whoever involves this case

235
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,200
has shown up here

236
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,200
But the case still cannot be figured out

237
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,120
Now I'm not allowed to take the corpse away

238
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,670
I really don't know what to do now.

239
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,910
How about

240
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,070
the two sided of you have a fight?

241
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,060
Sounds good

242
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,970
Drop the weapon

243
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,310
Don't stir up trouble You onlooker

244
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,430
Don't you hear what am I saying?

245
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,460
You want to make it worse don't you?

246
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,600
A man was killed

247
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,870
Oh Leader Cui?

248
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,640
This man died

249
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,760
And it is apparent that he didn't kill himself by jumping the river

250
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,020
At present I do not have any evidence

251
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,100
for accusing of murder

252
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,730
However the man died in your Yishengmen's territory

253
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,600
I bring my men to here for confrontation

254
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,750
It is legally allowed isn't it?

255
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,200
Sure it is

256
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,080
Then why are you Leader Cui

257
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,760
trying to get yourself out of this event so eagerly?

258
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,500
Are you afraid of something?

259
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,560
Fine

260
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,970
Now that you Chairman Ding has said so

261
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,430
I Craze Cui take a stepback

262
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,240
I allow  Junior Tientsin Mystic to carry the corpse to the Temple

263
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,120
When the whole things come to clear

264
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,660
any explanation needed

265
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,900
will be offered by us the Door of Life

266
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,610
However Yu Si has made some trouble

267
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,570
And we must talk about it clearly

268
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,290
What is it?

269
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,940
You can't prove that this man was killed by my men

270
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,040
But you bring so many guys to my territoty

271
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,440
What does it mean?

272
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,310
It means that you make trouble out of nothing

273
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,030
And Yu Si took the lead to wield his knife and wanted to fight just now.

274
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,400
His behavior has posed threats to the security of

275
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,330
the brothers of the Door of Life

276
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,740
and our workers at the wharf

277
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,550
If I just let you go

278
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
simply and without any action

279
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,000
what will my men think of me?

280
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,120
A coward!

281
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,590
What do you want?

282
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,790
Now that you are at my wharf

283
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,410
and Captain Fu is here too

284
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,480
I will not bully you

285
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,640
What about one week later at your wharf

286
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,540
at the Nangu Wharf we have a cultural competition.

287
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,740
And no matter this case is settled or not at that time

288
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,820
It will be counted on the loser's side

289
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,790
How about that?

290
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,120
Deal

291
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,460
You don't have the final say We'd better ask Master Ding

292
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,480
A cultural competition

293
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,310
Okay Cultural competition

294
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,300
At that time you'd better bring all of you men

295
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,610
Don't say words like we bully you

296
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,440
There There There

297
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,500
It is settled privately by you guys

298
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,990
Under such circumstance

299
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,000
it is neccesary for us policemen to preside the whole mass

300
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,880
Or else something terrible must have happened

301
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,970
Fine Don't stand there blankly

302
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,100
Hurry and carry the corpse away

303
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,720
Go home dudes

304
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,970
Go back

305
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,380
Go back home Go

306
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,730
The crowd dispersed

307
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,600
Withdraw

308
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,230
The foreign stuff you brought from abroad

309
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,430
I really don't like drinking it before

310
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,210
But in this place I can bear its taste now

311
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,980
You can drink coffee in the jail?!

312
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,660
The Chamber has bought off some officials concerned

313
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,920
They won't treat me badly

314
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,070
Take it easy

315
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,470
Are there many questions waiting for me?

316
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,200
As long as you promise me one thing

317
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,370
I will tell you everything I know

318
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,700
Go ahead

319
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,400
Protect the Chamber and don't let it bankrupt

320
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,750
You have my words

321
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,360
Good

322
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,930
Which part do you want me to start?

323
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,210
Demonic Cult

324
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,510
Speaking of it

325
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,990
we need to trace back to twenty years ago

326
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,020
A flood suddenly and weirdly struck Tianjin

327
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,190
It caused great disasters to the region

328
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,350
especially the Qiming Village in downstream direction

329
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,420
Almost all of the Qiming Village was drowned in the flood

330
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,010
The surviving villagers suffered from a mysterious illness

331
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,530
Their blood vessels protuberated and skin festered

332
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,610
They could ease their pain only by taking the opium

333
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,650
Not long after a devil cult rised in the Qiming Village

334
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,470
And the cult was called Demonic Cult

335
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,400
Its believers held that

336
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,310
a holy child  was born in the world

337
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,950
and he was the incarnation of River Demon

338
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,540
Holy Child can exempt people from natural disasters

339
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,040
and epidemic diseases

340
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,920
In order to find Holy Child

341
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,870
the villagers caught almost all kids in Tianjin

342
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,710
and forced them to drink the blood of the illed

343
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,160
They did believe that

344
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,130
the child who survived

345
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,280
must be the Holy Child

346
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,230
It was a famous event in Tianjin.

347
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,240
People spread that a flood

348
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,540
had flushed out the River Demon.

349
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,540
Therefore the local government odered

350
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,930
to wipe out the Demonic Cult

351
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,290
Your father then was the Chief General

352
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,520
and I was his deputy

353
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,530
People said that River Demon could only be subdued by Tientsin Mystic

354
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,390
so they gathered at the Dragon King Temple

355
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,620
begging Master Guo Guo Chun for help

356
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,730
Finally your father Master Guo and I

357
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,690
we led a troop to subdue the Cult in Qiming Village

358
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,470
Unforfunately our plan was leaked out

359
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,280
Demonic Cult had made preparations against us

360
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,640
One of them mastered witchcraft

361
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,320
and practiced some unknown witchcraft

362
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,180
that made us hundreds of officals and soldiers

363
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,330
kill each other

364
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,250
as if we had hysteria and mental disorder

365
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,080
We suffered great losses

366
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,770
Althrough we succeeded in eliminating the Cult

367
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,500
the kids caught by them

368
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,600
seldom survived

369
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,470
Till now I can still recall

370
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,410
those kids soaking in the vats of blood

371
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,300
The local government regarded this action as a failure

372
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,210
so they kept all the news under wraps

373
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,780
The brain of Demonic Cult who mastered witchcraft

374
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,620
was put in prison

375
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,790
Master Guo went back and continued his corpse retrieval career

376
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,280
Your father and I left the military

377
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,820
and started operating Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

378
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,350
The whole event quieted down for the time being

379
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,960
Our business met good times

380
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,870
and run very well

381
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,280
It tool only a dozen years

382
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,900
for the Chamber

383
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,510
to be the most successful business in Tianjin

384
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,440
We all thought that the whole event would fade and be forgot

385
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,420
It has never been expected

386
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,340
that in there years the Demonic Cult

387
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,820
seems to revive

388
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,710
and even penetrate our Chamber

389
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,350
Your father were determined to eradicate them

390
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,930
but he noticed that this time

391
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,580
the witchcraft of Demonic Cult grew more powerful

392
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,850
When a believer became terminally ill

393
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,360
he would either die in great pain

394
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,030
or sacrifice his body to the hierarch

395
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,820
for prolonging the life by witchcraft

396
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,420
The price is that they will lose their consciousness

397
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,620
and become  as savage and cruel as beasts and ghosts

398
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,310
But they are still normal people in appearance

399
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,540
so they penetrate our Chamber

400
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,310
to try to control our shipping

401
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,270
to further control the cargo flow of opium

402
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,160
alleviating their pains to the greatest extent.

403
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,900
Chairman Ding made use of this opportunity.

404
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,370
He mixed opium with the poison,

405
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,720
in order to elimate those believers when they took opium.

406
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,590
It was an extreme measure.

407
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,970
But eliminating Demonic Cult

408
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,770
was the only way to save more people.

409
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,370
This matter,

410
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,010
besides being known by your father and me,

411
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,510
we also bought off

412
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,600
the Manager Wang who was in charge of an opium house.

413
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,360
Qian Zixian was an ordinary consumer.

414
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,860
But relying on his relationship with the Secretary Genneral Xiao,

415
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,570
he interfered in the business of the cigarette house

416
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,630
and threatened Manager Wang that

417
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,230
he would notify the officials if Wang didn't comply with his words.

418
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,880
So Manager Wang had to kill him with the poisoned opium.

419
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,220
But I didn't expect that

420
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,630
you found the cigarette house

421
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,820
and even caught the Manager Wang.

422
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,840
So,

423
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,730
the only way to cover up this matter for me

424
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,560
was to kill her.

425
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,460
Twenty years ago we exterminated them.

426
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,070
They learned the lesson.

427
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,200
This time they didn't dare to be unbridled,

428
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,140
and abandoned the practice of snatching children.

429
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,550
They wanted to create a holy child.

430
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,310
They let the interim hierarch and a virgin give birth to a son

431
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,800
and followed their own way

432
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,930
to raise him up to be an eligible holy child.

433
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,940
Xue Yuanyuan?

434
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,300
Luckily, Chairman Ding carried off the baby in advance.

435
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,480
But the baby is innocent.

436
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,410
Chairman Ding didn't want to kill that baby.

437
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,180
But someone needs to sacrifice his life.

438
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,350
Demonic Cult has killed so many people.

439
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,220
If we let them

440
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,450
create their so-called holy child,

441
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,750
I can't imagine what will happen.

442
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,420
The only thing that we can do

443
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,460
is to stop them from the source.

444
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,990
That is to say,

445
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,920
for the purpose of taking revenge,

446
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,170
Demonic Cult killed my father.

447
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,860
This thought is the expected result

448
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,370
that your father and I wanted to achieve.

449
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,610
But the truth is that

450
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,900
Chairman Ding

451
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,760
was killed by me.

452
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,530
Chairman Ding, don't we have other options?

453
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,040
This is the ideal way.

454
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,530
I don't want to become a monster

455
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,560
and be killed by other people.

456
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,960
Moreover, I have killed so many people.

457
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,230
But you did it for saving others.

458
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,450
That baby is innocent.

459
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,820
Firstly drive the boat near the Qiming village

460
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,710
and carry the statue of Xuanwu to the boat.

461
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,930
Then drive the boat

462
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,370
to the desolate sea.

463
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,650
Tie the Chairman and the statue together

464
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,990
by an iron chain.

465
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,880
The people and the statue

466
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,790
were then thrown into the water.

467
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,320
After that, drive the boat near the River Worship Ceremony

468
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,850
and untie the chain.

469
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,489
Why you choose that day?

470
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,030
After we exterminated Demonic Cult that year,

471
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,250
we killed the leftover evils before the statue of Xuanwu

472
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,170
and begged the Great God Xuanwu for quelling the River Demon,

473
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,920
blessing the peace of the Haihe River.

474
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,270
In the process of carrying off the baby,

475
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,230
Chairman Ding was injured, and we found that

476
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,610
the virus of Demonic Cult could be infected through the wound.

477
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,679
So Chairman Ding made this unwise decision.

478
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,510
He wants to kill himself

479
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,680
to arouse people's consciousness.

480
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,020
Just think that the man who led troops to wipe out the River Demon

481
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,850
was tied to the the Great God Xuanwu

482
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,270
and drowned in the river.

483
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,290
It was bound to be considered as

484
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,260
the Demonic Cult's killing for its revenge.

485
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,450
This could not only alert the world,

486
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,130
but also make more righteous persons from all corners realize that

487
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,490
Demonic Cult has made a comeback.

488
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,570
So after Manager Wang was found out,

489
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,790
I tried to disguise her death

490
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,200
as drowning in the prison,

491
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,800
so as to point the finger

492
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,560
at the River Demon:

493
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,680
Demonic Cult.

494
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,120
Chairman Ding did this,

495
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,070
becacuse he wanted to end all the feud

496
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:42,000
in our generation

497
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,020
and leave a pure Chamber of Commerce

498
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,920
to you.

499
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,950
If Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

500
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,810
has done some underhand business,

501
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,170
then the death of Chairman Ding and Tianming

502
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,840
and my current situation

503
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,240
will compensate for what we have done.

504
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,160
Young Master,

505
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,100
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation is now relying on you.

506
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,400
Where does a river flow to

507
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,440
is not beyond our control.

508
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,520
It is pushed forward by water.

509
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,760
Probably it may eventually go into the sea.

510
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,650
There is also a possiblity that

511
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,670
it may flow to a distant revine

512
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,660
and then dry up.

513
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,270
Master Guo.

514
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,220
Master Guo, Master Guo.

515
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,030
What's the matter?

516
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,030
The corpse is in place.

517
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,080
I know.

518
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,800
Do we just leave the corpse alone?

519
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,410
When the Chamber and the Door of Life end their matter,

520
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,590
someone will come to take it away.

521
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,370
Master Guo, do you need to perform an autopsy?

522
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,000
How?

523
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,930
This corpse died so odd.

524
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,500
Should we invite the elder Master Guo to analyze it?

525
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,200
My master has left.

526
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,530
Left?

527
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,830
Where did he go?

528
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,060
I have no idea.

529
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,000
He left his tobacco rod.

530
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,970
I'm very anxious now.

531
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,880
Has something happened to the elder Master Guo?

532
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,640
Tianjin now is far from peaceful.

533
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,150
You guys have to be careful.

534
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,950
Let other brothers

535
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,600
go to the elder Master's accustomed haunts

536
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,670
and ask around

537
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
to see who he has met recently

538
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,870
and what has he done.

539
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,490
Ni Qiu, spread the message that

540
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,690
Senior Tientsin Mystic disappeared.

541
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,940
No matter who in Tian

542
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,580
can give us information,

543
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,830
Corpse Retrieval Team will express its appreciation.

544
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,650
OK.

545
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,720
Go ahead.
