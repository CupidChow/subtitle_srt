00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,770
Let's continue the story.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,980
Last time we said that

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,760
Ding Mao, young master of Canal Transport Chamber of Commerce, was angry with his father.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,860
He threw himself into a river and was rescued by the Junior Tientsin Mystic Guo Deyou.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,720
But they didn't expect that two corpses appeared in the worship ceremony of the Tientsin Mystic.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,440
The small corpse was a dead infant with green hair.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,140
The big one was Ding Mao's father, Ding Yiqiu.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,010
Ding Mao firmly believed that

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,670
the Junior Tientsin Mystic Guo Deyou killed his father.

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,810
The Senior Tientsin Mystic Guo Chun

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,320
lightened up to analyze grievances at the dock.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,230
All of a sudden it was windy and foggy with sadness.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,320
But nothing happened in the end.

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,680
Guo Deyou became suspicious.

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,170
He slipped into Canal Transport Chamber of Commerce.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
Regardless of his weakness,

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,480
Guo Deyou lightened up to analyze grievance and fainted on the spot.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,040
Ding Mao found him and

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:45,980
led him out.

21
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,280
They broke into the police station by day and

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,250
searched in Dragon King Temple at night.

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,390
Officer Ding was impressed and

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,030
wanted to take the Senior Tientsin Mystic as his teacher.

25
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,130
Come on, Guo Deyou.

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,900
Otherwise

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,270
your master and my mother will sober up.

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,630
What are you doing, Gu Ying?

29
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,660
I'll experiment on your elder brother.

30
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,360
He is not a boom.

31
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,740
He is a speechless living being,

32
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,810
so why can't I experiment on him?

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,390
Have you told me that

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,050
you've known how to lighten up to analyze grievances?

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,670
So you bragged?

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
Lighten up to analyze grievances.

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,550
Analyze grievances by lighting-up.

38
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,330
Guo Deyou, what's wrong with you?

39
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,420
Paper men and horses were also bought.

40
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,510
Burning them will make our eyes sting and choke.

41
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,180
Besides, there is a fire hazard.

42
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,490
So what's the meaning of this?

43
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,510
You father died, so we have to hold a funeral to memorialize him.

44
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,140
Otherwise, he will feel lonely.

45
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,020
People will become inorganic substances when they die.

46
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,720
No matter how many paper men and horses we burn for them,

47
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,050
they can't receive them.

48
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,860
Actually, these paper men and horses

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,470
aren't burnt for the dead,

50
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,500
but for the living people.

51
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,930
Only if they burn these paper men and horses,

52
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,270
they can show how much they miss the dead,

53
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,890
and they can feel relieved.

54
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,980
Guo Deyou.

55
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,060
How dare you!

56
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,580
How dare you do violence in Canal Transport Chamber of Commerce!

57
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,480
Do violence?

58
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,350
It's you who

59
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,720
beat Guo Deyou first.

60
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,230
Do you know where you are?

61
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,090
He didn't drown in the river.

62
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,900
What did you say?

63
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,990
Your father.

64
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,650
He drowned in the sea.

65
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,410
First of all, he had been tied up on the Xuanwu statue,

66
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,560
and then thrown into the sea.

67
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,570
After that, he had been dragged with the statue

68
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,670
to the place where I found him.

69
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,070
Firstly, you weren't at the scene of the crime.

70
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,680
Secondly, you don't have any files to prove you're right.

71
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,760
Thirdly,

72
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,730
you haven't specialized in autopsy analysis.

73
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,150
But you can say the causes of his death.

74
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,740
Expect the murderer,

75
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,150
I can't think of another guy who can do this.

76
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,440
Say the causes of his death?

77
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,440
So you mean I'm right?

78
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,100
I have identified the corpse.

79
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,030
Wow, you did dare to hurt you father.

80
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,900
So say it,

81
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,740
what's your motive?

82
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,430
Have you had laver?

83
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,750
What?

84
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,020
Laver is a kind of aquatic weed.

85
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,240
It's a little red.

86
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,470
Citizens in Tianjin

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,520
love to make laver egg soup most.

88
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,990
In the district which is nobody's business,

89
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,640
there is a steamed bun restaurant

90
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,190
which is next to Ruifengxiang Silks and Satins Shop.

91
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,700
It's a wonderful experience to have the laver egg soup and the steamed buns

92
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,260
in the restaurant.

93
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,450
Every customer will be full of praise for the soup and buns.

94
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,040
But then,

95
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,100
have you ever seen laver in a river?

96
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,030
What do you want to say?

97
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,250
Every industry has its own rules,

98
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,440
so does the river.

99
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,230
The red can't grow in the river, while the yellow can't grow in the sea.

100
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,250
In your father's mouth and nose,

101
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,310
I found tiny red algae residues,

102
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,200
so your father died in the sea

103
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,160
instead of

104
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,370
the place where we salvaged him.

105
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,530
On his wrists,

106
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,350
there were deep marks which were strangled by an iron chain.

107
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,740
So it's impossible that he was taken there,

108
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,130
tied up on the Xuanwu statue and then thrown into the river.

109
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,640
It seems that he and the Xuanwu statue

110
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,260
were tied to the bottom of the ship,

111
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,760
and then dragged to the place.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,260
But if people wanted to start such a heavy cargo ship

113
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,300
without being discovered,

114
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
they must do it at night.

115
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,870
The more intensive you say, the more suspected you are.

116
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,760
In Tianjin,

117
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,100
as for the companies who can mobilize such a heavy ship,

118
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,600
can you guess how many are there?

119
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,510
Only you, Canal Transport Chamber of Commerce.

120
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,600
How many ships are there

121
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,930
whose load is more than 20 tons in Canal Transport Chamber of Commerce?

122
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,770
Why are you asking?

123
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,530
Those nights when my father disappeared,

124
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,240
was there a ship like this leaving port?

125
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,670
Ships like this won't leave port at night

126
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,320
because of bad vision, and it will have troubles.

127
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,640
Are you sure?

128
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,970
These are clearance records of our ships.

129
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,220
You can check it.

130
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,540
Young master, I know you're anxious,

131
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,720
but this kind of thing,

132
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,480
we should leave it to the police.

133
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,430
Happier, happier, happier.

134
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,450
insincere, insincere, insincere.

135
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,500
There's no need to be insincere.

136
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,840
You wanna see, you will sea.

137
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,580
What a rare visitor, young master Ding!

138
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,520
What a rare visitor!

139
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,720
When are you going to solve my father's case?

140
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,300
Well, please relax.

141
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,530
All the staff in the police station

142
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,280
are dedicating ourselves to

143
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,310
detect the case day and night.

144
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
I think it will be solved soon.

145
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,160
There are 37 policemen under your control,

146
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,630
and right now you have 9 major cases

147
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,950
which are asked to be detected in limited time.

148
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,190
You've assigned 26 policemen

149
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,310
to these cases.

150
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,140
It's a question of their business,

151
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,980
so I think they're working hard on the 9 cases.

152
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,700
Besides, there are 3 policemen asking for leave.

153
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,660
According to the regulations,

154
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,470
there must be 2 policemen on duty in every department.

155
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,080
So it seems that

156
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,680
the available policemen,

157
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,070
including yourself,

158
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,990
there are only 7.

159
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,960
They are outside.

160
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,510
You didn't go to the crime scene for investigation

161
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,730
and search for clues in the first place.

162
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,750
You are staying here and doing nothing.

163
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,090
So as for your dedication to the case,

164
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,460
I can't believe it.

165
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,480
It is said that young master Ding of Canal Transport Chamber of Commerce

166
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,180
is young and promising,

167
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,780
and similar to Chairman Ding.

168
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,760
It turns out that a tiger father will not beget a dog son.

169
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,060
You're the chief of the police station,

170
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,100
so you have to be responsible for this case

171
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,860
make it clear.

172
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,260
Fine.

173
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,310
I will not play silly games with young master Ding.

174
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,570
If you don't trust us,

175
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,600
I suggest that

176
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,690
young master Ding investigate the case in person.

177
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,570
Me?

178
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,240
You learnt forensic medicine in Germany,

179
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,080
so I think you're supposed to know something about case investigation.

180
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,780
A talent like young master Ding,

181
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,440
is rarely seen in the police station.

182
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,280
What do you mean?

183
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,220
In the police station,

184
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,430
there are too many unimportant persons,

185
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,400
so we are in urgent need of talents like young master Ding

186
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,580
who are brilliant, well educated

187
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,010
and competent.

188
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,160
Otherwise,

189
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,800
even if you hound me to death,

190
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,630
my answer is "Try my best."

191
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,590
How can I investigate?

192
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,430
Special detective, so treat special issues specially.

193
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,410
Special detective?

194
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,850
I assign a new identification to you,

195
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,220
so it'll be easy for you to begin the work.

196
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,930
But your identity is limited to investigating this case

197
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,680
No pay, no guns

198
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,650
OK

199
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,540
It's a deal

200
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,360
It's a deal

201
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,890
Dizzy

202
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,340
Take young  master Ding to get a temporary police card,

203
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,130
which becomes operative immediately

204
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:01,910
OK

205
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,230
Let's go, young master Ding

206
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,620
Captain,

207
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,520
how did you employ a young master

208
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,590
who will grab your job

209
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,840
Can you be smart?

210
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,600
He takes care of his father's affairs by himself

211
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,640
In this way, the attention of the newspaper

212
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,250
will naturally be taken away from our police station

213
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,010
to focus on the domestic affairs of  Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

214
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,120
The young master who returned from studying abroad

215
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
personally took over the case of his father‘s death

216
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,640
If I were the president of the newspaper

217
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,740
I will be so happy

218
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,680
What are you doing there?

219
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,420
The dead child has just been fished out

220
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,380
You either hurry to clean up

221
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,380
or come and help

222
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,150
Isn't that broken by that crazy girl?

223
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,870
This is something you passed on to me

224
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,690
How can I do without fixing it?

225
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,610
You don't have to apologize

226
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,160
I don't bear grudges

227
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,270
If you feel guilty

228
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,200
You can treat us to a good meal

229
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,780
I'm going to interrogate you now

230
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,700
If you don't cooperate

231
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,940
I can only take you back to the police station

232
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,950
You can try

233
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,990
Do you really think I'm not here

234
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,640
Young master Ding

235
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,070
I have never been abroad

236
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,570
But I hear everything has rules

237
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,910
When the county magistrate handled the case,

238
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
people could refute it

239
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,720
If people have any evidence,

240
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,830
can verify it one by one in court

241
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,270
What do you mean?

242
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,310
You arrest me with this today

243
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,390
Even if you arrest me, what can you do?

244
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,180
I have told you

245
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,070
I'm not the one who killed your father

246
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,940
You don't trust me

247
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,850
Alright, I will tell you now

248
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,440
I was the one who killed your father

249
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,220
Do you have any proof?

250
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,460
Young master Ding

251
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,190
There are some professions that are elegant

252
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,320
There are some professions that are vulgar

253
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,510
The government has its reasons

254
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,200
So does rivers and lakes

255
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,190
Your father died in water

256
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,850
There's something strange with this case

257
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,080
People who makes a living by  water and wharf

258
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,760
is not only Guo Deyou

259
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,420
You're going to take your piece of paper

260
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,010
to interrogate people door to door

261
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,430
Do you have any ideas?

262
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,810
There is a man who can't lie

263
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,640
What he said,

264
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,640
maybe you can trust it

265
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,650
Who?

266
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,190
The dead child

267
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm looking into my dad's case

268
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,310
What does this have to do with that child?

269
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,500
Corpses floating in the same place on the same day

270
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,810
If you unravel the mystery of one, you will know the other

271
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,000
Be careful

272
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,550
This is a whole corpse

273
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,810
If his family came

274
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,730
and see this corpse dismembered by you

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,260
How can I explain

276
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,460
So what can we do?

277
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,550
Hold it

278
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,530
Hold it

279
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,120
Don't touch. Don't smell

280
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,290
Just look

281
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,430
Legal medical expert without a scalpel

282
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,480
What are you doing here

283
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,110
The first step in learning  legal medical expert is observation

284
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,130
I know that better than you

285
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,050
Do you want to make a bet?

286
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,060
What are you gambling on?

287
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,730
A big meal

288
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,570
OK

289
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,680
Please

290
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,820
What are you doing?

291
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,660
That's a taboo

292
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,680
What is the taboo

293
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,620
What are you doing?

294
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm turning fish

295
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,870
That's taboo for business in the water

296
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,820
Superstition

297
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,670
The old saying may not have a basis

298
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,210
But there is always a reason for doing things

299
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,030
Anyone who works or lives with water

300
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,210
has the taboo of turning fish

301
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,370
The child has a strong body

302
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,450
It means his mother had good diet when she was pregnant with him

303
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,440
The child is 80% likely to belong to a wealthy family

304
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,260
How can a wealthy family

305
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,610
do such a cruel thing

306
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,930
The wealthier people are

307
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,270
the more dirty things they do

308
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,980
As the young master of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

309
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,260
You should know more about this kind of thing than I do

310
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,000
I think...

311
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,740
the child was drowned

312
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,770
We're corpse hunters

313
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,360
who see floating bodies every day

314
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,630
If this man was drowned or not

315
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,850
by a glance

316
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,900
I can judge it pretty close

317
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,880
It's something in my head

318
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,650
However,

319
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,450
something in your head

320
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,630
is not always right

321
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,480
I think

322
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,300
the child was not drowned

323
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,850
For general rich and influential family,

324
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,080
If a child has any problems

325
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,540
they won't give up easily

326
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,250
After all, they want to continue their blood

327
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,150
Therefore, he must be a child of a poor family

328
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,140
because he can't afford medical expenses,

329
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,450
he made such a bad policy

330
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,900
Master

331
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,930
This meal is a gamble

332
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,980
I wouldn't have ordered so many food if I had known result

333
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,070
You need to give us a definite answer

334
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,630
Which of us is right

335
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,110
No matter who you two lose or win

336
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,170
I can always eat this meal

337
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,100
What are you doing, young master

338
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,480
This meal is my treat to master Guo

339
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,780
But that doesn't mean I give up

340
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,220
There must be a conclusion today

341
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,500
Let's go in and have an autopsy again

342
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,830
Go back, young master

343
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,960
The family should be worried

344
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,890
Ding Mao

345
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,480
Grab the leaves and put them there

346
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,820
Go

347
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,770
OK

348
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,230
Bring the oil lamp in the room

349
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,420
Make it higher

350
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,920
OK

351
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,920
Sprinkle the oil evenly

352
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,610
Sprinkle a little over there

353
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,090
OK. That's enough

354
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,460
Bring the soybeans from the cupboard in the west of the kitchen

355
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,980
Master

356
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,160
What are you going to do?

357
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,910
Walk in the evening.  Be careful

358
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,650
Where are you going to?

359
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,550
I am chasing people

360
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,890
Isn't this here?

361
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,130
Hold it

362
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,900
Be professional

363
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,530
What do you mean?

364
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,210
If people doesn't make a sound, he steals. If people makes a sound, he robs

365
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,980
This guy's ass is all over the place

366
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,910
However, he didn't make a sound

367
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,790
Although the thief's intention is not for money,

368
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,370
the thief...

369
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
The thief follows the rules of the industry

370
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,470
I don't care about the rules

371
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,410
Why did he steal a dead baby

372
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,280
I said you had to ask the dead boy

373
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,720
Master Guo, I want to  take you as my master

374
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,320
I found you

375
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,430
still have an advantage

376
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,100
that is you are so interesting

377
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,990
Young master Ding

378
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,520
Snake and mouse have their ways

379
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,420
I'm afraid our business is not suitable for you

380
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,850
What do I see today is called there's always something better

381
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,590
If I only rely on what I have learned abroad

382
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,860
to make a thorough investigation of my father's case

383
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,100
in Tianjin later

384
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,610
I'm afraid I will become a joke

385
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,140
I hope master will agree to my request

386
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,550
You're a joke now

387
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,890
Do you know why did the master

388
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,120
only take me as his apprentice

389
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,950
Talent, disposition, moral quality and abilities

390
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,200
Those are all indispensable

391
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,260
I'm not inferior to you in these conditions

392
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,950
Young people, don't be arrogant and impatient

393
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,830
You'd better expose your upper body first

394
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
to go flush and calm down

395
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,590
Master, don't worry

396
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,060
I will learn it well

397
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,990
What about the tuition fee?

398
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,710
How much?

399
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,750
Cash 1000 yuan

400
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,590
OK

401
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,260
You have to have a family feast in Taifeng restaurant for three days in a row

402
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,110
No problem

403
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,030
Ten years as an apprentice

404
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,640
During this period, you can only serve the master

405
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,190
It's your destiny to die and flee

406
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,090
It has nothing to do with master

407
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,060
Every Dragon Boat Festival, Mid Autumn Festival, new year's day, Confucius' birthday and master's birthday, you need to send presents

408
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,950
Anything else?

409
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,560
Young master, I mean that...

410
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,070
Can you stop being mischievous?

411
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,070
Can you go back to wash and sleep? Ok?

412
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,420
If there's nothing else, I will kowtow

413
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,050
Hold your horse

414
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,320
Every profession has its own rules

415
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,310
Yes, rules

416
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,070
What are rules?

417
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,410
Put it there

418
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,170
Come on, quickly

419
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,650
Be careful

420
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,970
Slow down

421
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,220
Thanks for master's care

422
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,440
Who do you call master

423
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,530
Tientsin Mystic

424
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,870
When did I promise to take you as an apprentice

425
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,750
People who can catch the  tortoise

426
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,040
can worship the Tientsin Mystic as a teacher

427
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,270
The rule

428
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,240
can't change

429
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,700
No

430
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,860
What are you doing now?

431
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,530
I'm moving closer to where you live, so I can learn skills

432
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,020
What skills are you learning

433
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,050
In addition

434
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,550
Who knows if it's true

435
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,840
You let the two goddess to test

436
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,940
Come on.  Take it here.

437
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,720
Come on

438
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,260
Be careful

439
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,550
Young people

440
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,600
To be a man and to do things

441
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,970
First of all, we should pay attention to honesty

442
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,940
Let's not go astray

443
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,700
Go back where you come from

444
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,840
Hurry up

445
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,840
What's that room for

446
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,760
To live

447
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,220
Thanks

448
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,270
Move things to the second floor

449
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,250
What?

450
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,580
You put it down

451
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,730
Here is my house, Put it down

452
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,700
Down. Down. Down.

453
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,050
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

454
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,510
Master

455
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,560
This is specially prepared for you

456
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,570
You can try

457
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,460
What?

458
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,680
I think the reason why you often bend down to beat your back

459
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,910
is that it must be the chair  is not suitable

460
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,330
Such a precious thing

461
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,760
How can I afford it

462
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,210
Master, sit down first

463
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,090
You really make this your home, don't you?

464
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,600
This is for elder martial brother

465
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,730
Who is your elder martial brother？

466
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,160
Elder martial brother is usually lazy and slack

467
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,120
without sense of time

468
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,080
So I specially prepared it,

469
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,730
a clock made in Germany

470
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,480
Send a clock(In Chinese, sending someone a clock means attending someone's funeral)

471
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,770
We encourage each other

472
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,560
to make efforts together

473
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,420
Come on

474
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,510
Why are you still moving? Stop

475
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,630
Stop

476
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,410
Master, sit, please

477
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
How many cooks did you bring?

478
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,870
Master

479
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,060
This is elbow from Hong Shengyuan

480
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,230
This is the vinegar carp from dengyinglou

481
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,610
I heard that master likes to eat them

482
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,720
Therefore, I prepare them especially

483
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,120
Other foods

484
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,980
All of these are cooked by meself

485
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,090
State owns its own laws. Family has its own rules

486
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,460
Every professions have their own rules

487
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,690
Do you know what are rules?

488
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,010
Do you know

489
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,190
where you are sitting now

490
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,670
You look back

491
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,220
You are sitting in front of the kitchen god

492
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,620
How dare you sit in front of him

493
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,980
Every time master sat down, he still sat a little bit off side

494
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,310
How greatly disrespectful of you

495
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,680
Feudal

496
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,230
This is called the Rule

497
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,180
The Kitchen God is our householder

498
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,150
He bestows food on us

499
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,120
So this is the Rule

500
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,690
Don't expect me to be grateful for you

501
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,720
Just because of the money you spent

502
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:43,380
Once you leave here

503
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,900
You'are still the Young Master of the Dings

504
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,150
Do whatever you want out there

505
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,120
A teacher for a day is a father for a lifetime

506
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,030
Your father just died

507
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,280
And you rushed here to fawn on Master

508
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,520
If it weren't for other intentions

509
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,160
Then you are just greatly unfilial

510
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,870
First of all

511
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,980
I'm both the witness

512
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,010
and the investigator of the case last night

513
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,430
I have every reason to be here

514
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,000
Secondly

515
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,070
You corpse retrieval team are off-staff personnel

516
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,110
While I am the special detective

517
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,030
Technically I'm your senior

518
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,830
Thirdly

519
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,160
You haven't completely cleared off suspicion

520
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,780
on my father's case

521
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,180
I can take you to interrogation anytime

522
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,940
I've been in a bad temper these days

523
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,330
But today

524
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,180
I only acted politely and courteously

525
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,500
I went easy on you Guo Deyou

526
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,800
But I won't let you

527
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,060
treat me Ding Mao as such a pushover

528
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,620
You've gone too far

529
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,740
I'm determined

530
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,100
I'll be Master Guo's apprentice by all means

531
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,960
How dare you call him your master

532
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,350
You have no say here Guo Deyou

533
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,140
My rule is

534
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,680
No one speaks while eating

535
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,300
Eat

536
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,040
First tell me

537
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,270
What's your investigation plan

538
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,460
What did the man come for that day

539
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,180
For stealing the dead body

540
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,980
Who needed to do this

541
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,100
and why did he steal the infant's body

542
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,420
It now seems that

543
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,200
The fastest way to find out the truth

544
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,740
is to find out

545
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,160
this infant's identity

546
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,200
If that man is the infant's family

547
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,570
He could just walk in fair and square

548
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,960
Why would he risk stealing

549
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,530
Now that someone wants the dead body

550
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,810
But he won't show himself

551
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,380
It's very likely that

552
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,940
This infant is a bastard

553
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,380
That his identity cannot be revealed

554
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,590
He had no other way but steal from the roof

555
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,610
Completely empirical, no proof at all

556
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,160
You may just as well do your survey

557
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,010
in your dogged and tardy way

558
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,090
Surveying missing persons?

559
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,790
Especially missing kids and infants

560
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,900
The police office has its own rules

561
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,400
If Detective Ding breaks the rules

562
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,450
just to solve the case

563
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,510
How would my team treat me

564
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,430
as their head

565
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,800
Detective Ding

566
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,360
Anything else you want to report

567
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,980
aside from this

568
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,260
If not

569
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,490
You can go now

570
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,910
Do you have a pet captain

571
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,920
I've got my hands full feeding my big family

572
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,280
No spare time for pets

573
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,890
Then what's that room for

574
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,180
I'm the captain

575
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,720
With such important duty

576
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,260
I always lose track of time investigating

577
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,750
It's a room for rest

578
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,840
Quite convenient

579
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,000
Captain Fu you must be happily married

580
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,330
Why

581
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,620
I found there's a cup quite outstanding

582
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,350
not like others

583
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,220
But it can't be yours

584
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,560
since there's lipstick stain on it

585
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,000
Also I saw

586
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,800
There's animal hair on the chair

587
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,040
But you said you have no pet

588
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,310
Then it must be from a fur coat

589
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,110
I believe you won't wear a fur coat

590
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,120
while you work

591
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,170
And he/she who can sit on this chair

592
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,720
must be very close to you

593
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,080
So I think there's no other person

594
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,240
but your wife

595
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,020
Yes you're right

596
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,960
However

597
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,330
I have a question for you Captain Fu

598
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,090
What

599
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,600
Your wife is a Buddhist right

600
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
A devout one

601
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,420
Devout or not

602
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,810
She does embrace Buddhism

603
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,580
Right

604
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,910
I saw this photo of her

605
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,240
She has a flavor of natural elegance

606
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,450
Flattered

607
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,280
But why would a devout Buddhist

608
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,970
wear a fur coat

609
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,610
that comes from killing

610
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,560
And this lipstick stain that won't come off

611
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,080
It doesn't agree with her

612
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,890
who praises natural beauty

613
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,970
Don't you think

614
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,820
It's so very convenient

615
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,850
to have such a room for rest

616
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,010
Detective Ding

617
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,760
You said you want to survey missing persons right

618
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,870
Let's go

619
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,900
I'll show you to the archives room

620
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,540
Come here

621
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,890
Let's go

622
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,750
Don't you find the tea crumbles astringent

623
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,970
Tingyan

624
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,780
Get a pot of Sparrow tongue for Young Master Guo instead

625
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,040
There's no need

626
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,830
The tea crumbles are good enough

627
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,880
Not busy today by the river?

628
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,210
Not busy today

629
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,100
That's good

630
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,970
Tingyan

631
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,970
Why are you just standing there

632
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,910
Sing something for Young Master Guo

633
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,810
No no

634
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,270
There's no need

635
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,490
What do you come here for

636
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,370
You seem in no need for anything

637
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,800
I heard there's a new girl here

638
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,620
That's right

639
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,270
She's daughter of a government official

640
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,280
Then there was a mutiny

641
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,930
She fled here from afar

642
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,880
I had to take her in

643
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,030
Let me tell you something Young Master Guo

644
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,880
She's still a virgin

645
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,250
Do you want me to bring her here

646
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,830
Keep you company

647
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,520
My good sister

648
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,650
What's your source

649
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,400
Even got a girl like this

650
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,600
You know I make a living upon socializing

651
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,710
Of course I got my ears out there

652
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,330
Good sister

653
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,330
Sit

654
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,840
Please sit with me

655
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,050
I have something to ask you

656
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,130
Go ahead

657
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,100
Do you have pregnant girls here

658
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,380
So this is your kink

659
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,810
No I don't mean that

660
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,960
I meant to ask

661
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,820
If a friend of mine got pregnant

662
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,650
What should she do

663
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,230
Just deliver it

664
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,739
What if she got pregnant in your whorehouse

665
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,790
Did you do it Young Master Guo

666
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,460
Yes I got too excited

667
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,570
I couldn't control myself

668
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,489
You didn't have to beat around the bush

669
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,199
Easy peasy

670
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,110
Go find the Black Witch in the ghost market

671
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,600
The Black Witch

672
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,440
I have to remind you though

673
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,300
Don't break the ghosts' rules and good luck

674
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,220
I'll take all the blame

675
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,700
if Supervisor Hu should ask about it

676
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,530
Nothing to do with you

677
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,060
I won't go back

678
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,220
until I found out who killed my father

679
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,260
Young Master

680
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,100
No matter what others think

681
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,980
Are you sure you can find out the truth

682
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,230
moving to Yizhuang

683
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,400
For the time being

684
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,540
The dead infant is a real breakthrough

685
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,770
Either is Master Guo a mystic

686
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,650
or he does know something about my father

687
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,000
some clues at least

688
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,500
I pretend to be apprenticed

689
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,240
But my real intention is to investigate

690
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,770
I believe I'll find something useful

691
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,600
Serve yourself to some tea

692
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,460
Is the chair comfortable

693
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,690
Quite good

694
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,810
It's made from African Padauk

695
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,230
Brought back from the sea

696
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,400
And axeman Liu forged it himself

697
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,450
There are only few left on the market

698
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,820
Supervisor Hu

699
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,320
Do you want to bet with me again today

700
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,510
See the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation now

701
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,710
I can't afford to bet

702
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,070
Where's Ding Mao

703
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,180
I just found him back for you

704
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,230
You lost him again

705
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,350
Why do you keep him here

706
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,380
Kept here or not

707
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,850
He has his own things to do

708
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,120
No one knows

709
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,590
How far he can go

710
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,930
I told you I can't afford betting on this

711
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,820
I can't put Ding Mao at risk

712
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,420
Since the moment Chairman Ding and the black tortoise statue

713
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,530
were found together in the waters

714
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,730
All those who are relevant to what happened 20 years ago

715
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,390
have got in this punt together

716
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,680
It doesn't matter anymore

717
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,880
whether you can or cannot afford the bet

718
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,080
You mean the Demonic Cult
