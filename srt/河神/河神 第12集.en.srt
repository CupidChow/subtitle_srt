00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,210
Previously on the last episode.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,260
In the last episode,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,290
The son of Feng Erma, Xiao Hai, thought of that

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,520
it was Sun Laoqi who jumped out of the water

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,840
and dragged Feng Erma into the water biting him to death.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,050
At the wharf for grain transportation,

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,070
a verbal duel began with blood and cruelty.

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,440
Ding Mao stood transfixed to the ground.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,880
While the duel was still on,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,470
there was a splashing coming from the water

12
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,420
and suddenly a living corpse showed itself.

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,660
It was Sun Laoqi.

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,610
But what's behind was Junior Tientsin Mystic, Guo Deyou,

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,290
who caught Sun Laoqi with a fishing net.

16
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,940
The crowd fought with the living corpse

17
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,550
and finally killed him.

18
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,740
Ding Mao found a strange beetle

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,910
coming out of the mouth of Sun Laoqi.

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,870
And it crossed Guo Deyou's mind that he might have also met this kind of beetles

21
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,950
when he snuck into the morgue of the hospital.

22
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,730
Then they both went to the hospital.

23
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,570
And it all leads to the following that

24
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,770
Demon Sect takes his violent action while Guo and Ding fight with living corpses.

25
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,260
Lian Huaqing goes missing and a storm sure is coming.

26
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,920
What if we got caught?

27
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,660
We won't!

28
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,530
The hospital is on lockdown.

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,230
There's nobody!

30
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,230
It's too hot!

31
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,770
Put it on or you'll get infected.

32
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,390
You just don't wanna see my face!

33
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,110
Nonsense!

34
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Thank god.

35
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,790
I'll go back now and tell Yu Si

36
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,620
to get rid of the body at once

37
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,920
in case anything bad happens.

38
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,050
Let's just get out of here as soon as possible.

39
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,260
Excuse me.

40
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,130
I'm looking for Mr. Guo, Guo Chun.

41
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,520
Mr. Guo is gone.

42
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,250
When?

43
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,190
I think he's gone for some time.

44
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,110
Was he given a proper burial?

45
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,020
I... I mean Mr. Guo is gone. He's left.

46
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,410
He's not here! He's missing!

47
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,300
Missing?

48
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,790
How could he go missing?

49
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,870
What do you want from him?

50
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,770
There were three righteous men

51
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,060
who fought against Demon Sect together.

52
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,780
Ding Yiqiu is dead.

53
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,170
Steward Hu is now in prison.

54
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,760
And now we only have Mr. Guo.

55
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't you find it odd that

56
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,550
some time ago when the River Demon killed people

57
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
and the floating corpses appeared in the tobacco house?

58
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,650
The bigwigs and the public are all

59
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,400
keeping silent about what happened.

60
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:44,250
I think there must be something odd about it.

61
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,170
Do you hear that?

62
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,360
Something seems to be vibrating.

63
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,780
It's making my ears feel itchy.

64
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,400
You! What are you doing?

65
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,040
Run!

66
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,170
Daddy. I'm Xiao Hai!

67
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,050
Xiao Hai!

68
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,030
Gu Ying!

69
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,430
Daddy!

70
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,740
Take him to the second floor!

71
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,450
Come!

72
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,250
Go!

73
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,300
Have you two finished? Hurry!

74
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,880
Stop! What are you doing here?

75
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,140
Run! Fast!

76
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,130
Don't come near!

77
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,370
Where's mine?

78
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,660
Couldn't I get a finer weapon?

79
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,910
This?

80
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,360
This can be quite helpful in a surgery

81
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,490
Make good use of it

82
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,890
Come on

83
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,620
Take Xiao Hai with you and run!

84
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,160
No, I won't leave

85
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,160
Come on! Take Xiao Hai and go!

86
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,810
What you are doing is not helpful, don't waste your energy

87
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,120
Run

88
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,250
I will get someone for you

89
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,960
Guo Deyou, where are you Guo Deyou?

90
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,410
Where is Guo Deyou?

91
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,880
When you see him again

92
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,260
be sure to scold him for me

93
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,050
And let him know

94
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,820
how stubborn

95
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,320
and heartless he is

96
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,360
Tell him yourself

97
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,340
Daddy

98
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,700
Daddy

99
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,630
I am Xiao Hai

100
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,450
Gu Ying

101
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,950
Can you hear me now?

102
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,310
Run, Xiao Hai

103
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,660
He is not your father any more

104
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,700
Under this circumstance

105
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,870
why are you still doing researches?

106
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,650
Cut the crap

107
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,750
Go check out. Don't

108
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,210
Don't talk

109
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,610
What are you doing!

110
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,430
Shut up

111
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,930
There is a way out, come on

112
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,780
Wait

113
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,290
Don't worry

114
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,130
Five Light Gods, thunder and lightning

115
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,260
Save my life and subdue the evil

116
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,130
devious means, surrender under my power

117
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,280
Fire! There is a fire!

118
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,960
Daddy

119
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,970
You told me you would  take me to catch fish

120
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,320
You told me you would make kites for me

121
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,290
You told me you would make sugarcoated haws on a stick for me

122
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,840
The kind of sugarcoated haws which is so sweet that may cause toothache

123
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,410
Which one have you done?

124
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,540
You are a liar!

125
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,410
Xiao Hai

126
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,830
Xiao Hai

127
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,490
Ding Mao

128
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,580
Ding Mao

129
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,550
Ding Mao

130
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,430
You really are a prodigal son

131
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,180
The only thing you can do is eat and wait for death

132
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,900
What's happening there?

133
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,730
It's blocked

134
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,670
You should go first

135
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,820
You should get out and tell those who are working at the water transport that I was stuck here

136
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Just these rocks

137
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,290
can't stop such an extraordinary person

138
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,280
like me

139
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,500
You should go

140
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,240
we can't both stuck here

141
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,260
You should go out and get some help

142
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,100
Can't you help me?

143
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,670
Cut the crap and hurry up

144
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,920
Do you think

145
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,070
as long as the probability is beyond zero

146
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,250
and the sample is big enough

147
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,440
anything that might go wrong

148
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,130
will eventually happen

149
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,130
What, you, why are you here?

150
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,170
It's dangerous here

151
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,130
Many things

152
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,530
are more difficult than you have estimated

153
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,920
The more you worry about something

154
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,920
the more likely it will happen

155
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,760
Just as what I had worried about

156
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,050
indeed happened

157
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,330
Chairman Ding, thank you

158
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,130
Wait, you are...

159
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,550
Who are you?

160
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,680
Who are you talking to?

161
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,290
Lian Huaqing

162
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,660
Who is that?

163
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,690
Finally I get the chance to meet you two

164
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,230
With all the efforts

165
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,110
With all the efforts, Demon Sect

166
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,880
is rebuilt to become what it looks like today

167
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,560
Demon Sect

168
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,670
the army that requires so much energy

169
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,390
is gone due to the fire you two had set up

170
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,610
I know it is your guys behind all these

171
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,170
It's alright

172
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,170
As time goes by, bliss can come out of misfortune

173
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,600
For you, this means survival

174
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,960
For the Demon Sect, this means the mission

175
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,670
Mission stands for suffering

176
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,780
You are bring trouble to yourself

177
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,770
You are right. But where does this trouble

178
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,600
come from?

179
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,380
Stop

180
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,670
Don't let him escape

181
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,930
What are you doing? Go and catch him

182
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,380
Wait

183
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,490
Ding Mao

184
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,180
Get up, I will take you out

185
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,030
Don't move

186
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,840
Why? You are going to die

187
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,150
If you move my body, my wound will get worse

188
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,340
and I will die more quickly

189
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,230
Then what should I do?

190
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,680
Have you ever done any needlework before?

191
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,210
I have stitched shoe soles

192
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,100
Come here

193
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,690
Stitch for me

194
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,390
What should I stitch?

195
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,350
My abdomen

196
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,690
Stitch my wound together

197
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,610
as tight as possible

198
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,190
After that make a surgical knot

199
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,980
Never mind, just make a dead knot

200
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,410
The tighter the line, the better

201
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,080
What are you doing?

202
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,690
I can't see anything in the dark

203
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,580
Woke up! Woke up! Woke up!

204
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,340
Woke up!

205
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,580
Woke up!

206
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,950
Woke up! Woke up! Woke up!

207
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,790
You take a rest

208
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,800
He really woke up, Deyou

209
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,780
It's you who woken him up

210
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,590
Young Master

211
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,490
Gently, gently

212
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,290
Pour a glass of water for him to drink first

213
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,330
How long have you been here?

214
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,980
I didn't come to see you

215
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,290
I'm here to talk to Brother Si

216
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,070
I won’t go into the water and retrieve dead body anymore

217
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,290
It's me who saved your chairman Ding

218
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,350
Do I still have to work for the rest of my life?

219
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,440
Your  Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation should support me for life

220
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,320
That makes sense

221
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,620
One more is not much, count me in

222
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,260
If I have to support you two for life

223
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,720
I must worry about you for life

224
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:26,940
Captain

225
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,980
I glanced around

226
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,040
All blown up

227
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,640
None of them are complete

228
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,110
Did you see the morgue?

229
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,940
Did you see the morgue?

230
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,980
Yes

231
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,940
Captain, here's the strange thing

232
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,850
The morgue is empty

233
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,950
The corpses are mainly concentrated near the laboratory

234
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,300
and a few are in the other places, but they are all burnt

235
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,790
I can't do anything to check them

236
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,860
Captain, you decide

237
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,790
what to do?

238
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,470
No idea

239
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,389
Professor, how is the result?

240
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,880
I have studied the eggs and adults

241
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,090
They are ruled by the queen of the insects

242
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,139
the queen gives orders by the flapping frequency

243
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,969
of the wings

244
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,340
This parasite

245
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,489
must live in water during the egg stage

246
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,510
and when it grows into the adult stage

247
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,230
it can enter mammal body

248
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,449
through the wound

249
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,290
and find a host for asexual reproduction

250
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,300
In addition, it can continue to

251
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,300
enter a new host through new wounds and start new reproduction

252
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:44,960
Then I understand

253
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,690
Who is this foreign guy?

254
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,540
Professor Schroeder

255
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,010
My supervisor in Germany

256
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,460
What are you talking about?

257
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,739
The insects in those corpses

258
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,100
are very rare parasites

259
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,960
Their living habits are very similar to the ants

260
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,880
They can reproduce asexually in the carcass

261
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,710
Female insects can control the swarm by flapping their wings

262
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,310
In other words

263
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,560
someone can imitate

264
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,290
the flapping frequency of the female insect's wings

265
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,510
Is it okay to

266
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,070
give orders to the insects?

267
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,070
Probably

268
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,990
Controlling the insects means

269
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,490
Controlling the corpse

270
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,600
Do you remember that when in the hospital

271
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,030
we heard something similar to

272
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,790
the sound of the insect's  flapping wings

273
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,340
Lian Huaqing

274
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,000
Mo Gudao

275
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,030
Finally I know what their tricks are

276
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,360
It's not enough to know

277
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,410
we have to tread on this bug, Mo Gudao

278
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,810
underfoot hard

279
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,940
Professor

280
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,000
Does this parasite have any natural enemies?

281
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,960
Or

282
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,070
is there any effective way to kill it?

283
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,200
Research has just been started now

284
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,770
I can't answer this question for the moment

285
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,330
The insect itself

286
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,970
isn't aggressive or contagious

287
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,180
But after they find the host

288
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,620
their ability to control mammals

289
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,230
worths noting

290
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,730
Especially human must be more careful
