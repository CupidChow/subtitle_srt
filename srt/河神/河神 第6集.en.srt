00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,520
The story follows.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,670
The previous story said that

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,390
hundreds of floating dead bodies were stored in the

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,210
Charity Hospital of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,930
and the hospital was immediately locked down.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,690
Miss Xiao’s fiance Qian Zixian disappeared for many days.

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,270
Xiao Lanlan asked Ding Mao to enter the hospital

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,060
to find Qian Zixian’s whereabouts.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,080
Ding Mao agreed,

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,640
rushed to the hospital but was stopped from entering.

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,640
Supervisor Hu said that

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,750
the lockdown of the hospital was actually to control the epidemic.

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,930
Ding Mao remembered Xue Qingyang's confession that

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,780
the person who had taken the son of Xue Yuanyuan

16
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,250
eemed very consistent with his father.

17
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,370
Guo Deyou secretly investigates the bronze black tortoise statue at the bottom of the river where the body is sunken,

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,610
and tells Ding Mao that

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,460
he has a good plan to enter the hospital.

20
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,460
Guo Deyou led Ding Mao and Gu Ying into the hospital

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,290
and led out the story of

22
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,850
Tientsin Mystic lights a cigarette , Ding Mao performs the autopsy,

23
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,730
enter Cangcuilou again to check opium.

24
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,300
Guo Deyou wins the old goddess with strategy and

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,260
Xiao Sanye's secret meeting secretly connects Lian Huaqing

26
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,410
The outside is already so heavily guarded,

27
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,670
how can those lazy people lock the door at any time?

28
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,480
How can you live in the society

29
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,900
without knowing these tricks?

30
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,890
It's me.

31
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,860
Who?

32
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,430
It's me.

33
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,010
Miss Xiao?

34
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,920
Why are you here?

35
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,120
I almost beat you to death with a punch.

36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,970
How did you get in there?

37
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,630
I should ask you the question.

38
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,740
Since we were stopped that day,

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,870
I had been observing outside for a day.

40
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,570
I secretly changed into their clothes and ran in

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,620
while the guards were changing shifts.

42
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,810
That day?

43
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,770
Which day?

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,910
It has nothing to do with you.

45
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,890
Did you find anything special in there?

46
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,130
I just arrived,

47
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,670
and hid when I heard the movement.

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,720
I haven't found anything yet.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,730
Miss Xiao,

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,790
the yin here is too heavy,

51
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,300
not suitable for you rich lady.

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,970
Or let Gu Ying accompany you out

53
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,940
and give us some help.

54
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,560
Why? Why?

55
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,500
I want to go in too.

56
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,640
Judging from the varicose form of blood vessels,

57
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,470
it should be an infection caused by a certain virus.

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,530
But this is the first time I have seen

59
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,320
such a strange blood vessel color

60
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,620
and degree of protrusion.

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,710
Mr. Qian really died.

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,330
Really?

63
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,960
Did you find something?

64
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,770
Xiao Lanlan suspected that there was something happened to Mr. Qian,

65
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,220
so she asked me to bring her in for verification.

66
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,540
Fortunately, she didn't see this.

67
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,790
None of them is drowned.

68
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,910
What?

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,240
I've seen a lot of dead bodies.

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,910
I can see at a glance which ones are drowned,

71
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,910
which ones were thrown into the water after they died.

72
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,360
Empiricism,

73
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,250
there is no scientific basis.

74
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,830
These are life,

75
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,580
you just make a hasty conclusion.

76
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,680
Mr. Qian was found with them,

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,860
why is there no such virus on his body?

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,440
I...

79
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,270
I need to make more research.

80
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,240
Why didn't I see Xue Yuanyuan's body?

81
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,960
It was taken away by uncle Gui the day it floated up

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,310
and it should have been buried long ago.

83
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,780
Where is the child?

84
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
How many times do you want me to say it?

85
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,920
Xue Yuanyuan was tied

86
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,960
to an iron gate at the time,

87
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,490
and when I untied her,

88
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,020
all these dead bodies appeared.

89
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,230
But I didn't see

90
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,550
the dead child's body

91
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,160
Then they had premeditated to

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,640
lead us to open the door and

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,910
found the bodies.

94
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,210
Highly probable.

95
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,530
They are  really not drowned.

96
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,260
Aren’t you just believing in the foreign investigation style?

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,420
Though they are not drown,

98
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,380
however,

99
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,520
they didn’t die because of this virus.

100
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,960
They died from poisoning.

101
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,300
Poisoned?

102
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,130
Do you smell a smell of almonds?

103
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,300
A smell of almonds?

104
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,400
There are obvious bright red bleeding spots in

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,440
the conjunctiva, oral mucosa,

106
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
and nails of these people.

107
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,590
This is an obvious manifestation of cyanide poisoning.

108
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,550
The breath and vomit of

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,310
cyanide poisoning patients

110
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,180
have obvious bitter almond smell.

111
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,780
Cyanide...

112
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,290
What?

113
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,410
Is a chemical substance.

114
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,190
It can also be found in our lives.

115
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,170
For example, bitter almonds, peach kernels, ginkgo,

116
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,140
and loquat

117
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,540
all contain cyanide.

118
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,540
You mean they all

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,150
eat fruit to death.

120
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,980
If you inhale or take enough cyanide by mouth,

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,650
you will die within five minutes.

122
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,260
What you mean is that

123
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,290
died from eating

124
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,120
this kind of almonds or loquats?

125
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,470
Is cyanide poisoning.

126
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,450
Just look at them.

127
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,690
Go away.

128
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,100
He also died of cyanide poisoning.

129
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,980
Here comes people.

130
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,700
How long will these dead bodies be kept here?

131
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,290
If they are stinking, they will be burned.

132
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,980
Will not let the family members come to recognize the bodies?

133
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,170
Who will recognize the bodies when there is epidemic.

134
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,810
Did you hear that?

135
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,880
What?

136
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,560
There is movement.

137
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,570
How can the dead bodies move.

138
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,080
My condolences.

139
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,740
It's okay,

140
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,490
at least we find the person.

141
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,390
I also give an explanation to the two families.

142
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,650
Yes, there are so many men in the world,

143
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,670
and death is a relief.

144
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,690
Sorry.

145
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,440
Why do you have such a word?

146
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,430
I should thank you,

147
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,510
this matter finally has a result

148
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,440
and it will not be unclear.

149
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,800
I just hope

150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,740
the case can be investigated as soon as possible.

151
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,720
We have just performed a simple post-mortem,

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,940
including Mr. Qian,

153
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,160
all the people here died of cyanide poisoning and

154
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,370
were thrown into the river after death.

155
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,450
And

156
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,370
they are all infected with a virus.

157
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,500
What virus?

158
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,740
The specific virus is not clear,

159
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,230
but Mr. Qian does not have this virus.

160
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,550
I am not sure

161
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,360
what the connection is.

162
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,260
But don't worrry.

163
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,630
Since it happened at the dock of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

164
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
I am a member the commerce

165
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,420
and a police.

166
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,200
It is incumbent to investigate the case.

167
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,640
Of course I believe in Mr. Ding’s ability to handle things,

168
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,780
but the investigation style of police has always been like that,

169
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,610
I am afraid that the day of solving the case is still indefinitely.

170
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,410
We have already started to stun the snake,

171
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,350
and it will not be so easy to investigate the case

172
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,820
in the future.

173
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,480
We spent so much effort to get in and things are getting messier.

174
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,590
Do you have cigarettes?

175
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,600
What cigarettes?

176
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,650
Anything can be useful.

177
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
Er Ge, what are you doing?

178
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,410
Er Ge, what are you doing?

179
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,120
Don't you say it is messy,

180
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,510
We can't let it mess up anymore.

181
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,670
I have to find out what's going on.

182
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,770
Did Junior Tientsin Mystic want to to light cigarette to analyze grievances?

183
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,980
No,

184
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,590
You can't stand it.

185
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,380
Er Ge,

186
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,370
You don't listen to me,

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,030
don't you listen to Uncle Guo?

188
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,040
Disobedience and unfilial piety

189
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,280
will lead to retribution.

190
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,390
How long did we check the dead child?

191
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,670
The result? Where did it go?

192
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,630
Xue Yuanyuan’s body was also thrown into the water

193
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,180
when you saw someone throw it into the water with your own eyes.

194
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,450
Who can the girl offend

195
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,750
and she even died so uncleanly.

196
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,020
There are also more than one hundred dead bodies.

197
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,260
They are all lives

198
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,160
which dead unclearly.

199
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,550
I saw them come up with my own eyes and

200
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,170
fished them up with my own hands.

201
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,240
One of the suffering family member

202
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,580
is standing here now.

203
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,150
Ding Mao suddenly told me that

204
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
they were all poisoned to death.

205
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,030
My head is like paste right now

206
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,980
If I leave them alone and

207
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,560
watch them lying here and unable to be buried,

208
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,340
then I will get retribution.

209
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,750
Ding Mao, give me fire.

210
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,920
Here is the cigarette.

211
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,870
What cigarette?

212
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,170
Deyou.

213
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,180
Deyou.

214
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,400
Guo Deyou.

215
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,460
Deyou.

216
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,060
Deyou. Wake up quickly. Deyou.

217
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,090
What are you doing?

218
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,350
I'm saving his life. You go to ventilate here quickly.

219
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,070
OK.

220
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,850
Can he stand it if you use such big power?

221
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,540
The heart is not that weak like what you imagine.

222
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,200
Guo Deyou.

223
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,100
-Deyou. 
 -Guo Deyou.

224
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,650
Opium.

225
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,660
It is opium.

226
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,020
Deyou.

227
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,109
Is it still not enough to let them exposed?

228
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,510
Will the impact be too huge by using this?

229
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,069
This is evolution.

230
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
This is not only Demon Sect's evolution,

231
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,690
but it is also species' evolution and human beings' evolution.

232
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,010
Of course.

233
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,540
These evolutions must

234
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,550
be in my plan.

235
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,950
Will it be ostentatious?

236
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,350
It is on fire now. We just spice up it.

237
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,560
Are you scared?

238
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,420
No.

239
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,560
It's OK.

240
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,490
Fear is the most efficient infectious disease.

241
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,970
Only more huge fear

242
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,500
can promote bigger and quicker evolution.

243
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,130
The dead body has prepared step by step already.

244
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,240
It will leave nothing to chance.

245
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,280
I'm going now.

246
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,910
Captain Fu. Morning.

247
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,750
Is it morning?

248
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,470
I think you are too free.

249
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,640
What time is it now?

250
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,550
How do you know I'm free?

251
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,520
How can't it be urgent?

252
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,750
Captain Fu.

253
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,930
I considered it seriously this time.

254
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,860
You have your reason

255
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,960
that you don't let me take over the Hai River floating corpse case.

256
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,710
I definitely have my reason.

257
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,490
But you see that

258
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,690
I still have the title of

259
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,960
special detective.

260
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,860
I have to do something for Tianjin city.

261
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,850
If you say so,

262
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,550
I really want to give Detective Ding some cases

263
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,640
and let you have fun.

264
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,640
But it's a pity that

265
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,290
there are really no important matters

266
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,420
except the floating dead body case

267
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,240
made by the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

268
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,900
Look, I have a big mouth.

269
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,540
What Captain Fu said was right.

270
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,220
I see Captain Fu

271
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,150
is very fastidious to this snuff bottle.

272
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,020
Don't touch.

273
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,490
It's just fun that is far from being fastidious.

274
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,710
You see I don't know these

275
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,560
cigarettes, snuff, and opium.

276
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,210
Stop.

277
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,420
Mr. Ding, you can't say anything as you like.

278
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,610
Big tobacco is opium.

279
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,040
It's illegal.

280
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,270
It's a very different kettle of fish from my snuff.

281
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,710
You just said that

282
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,680
this opium was

283
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,570
maded of calfskin.

284
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,980
You just said that opium was illegal.

285
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,120
Then if I investigate the opium, you should not disapprove of it.

286
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,240
I tell you that

287
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,770
the whole Tianjin city has not opium already.

288
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,530
This. There is no place that can smoke opium

289
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,720
in such a big Tianjin city.

290
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,610
The ban on opium smoking is controlled so tightly.

291
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,120
It must not exist on the surface.

292
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,530
Regarding steal, rob, kidnap and cheat,

293
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,600
only rob is obvious.

294
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,640
The other three things are all done secretly.

295
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,240
The people in our police station

296
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,920
are all bright and obvious people.

297
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,780
We just take over the obvious cases.

298
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,620
If Mr. Ding wants to investigate the secret thing,

299
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
then you have to investigate secretly.

300
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,490
Secretly?

301
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
Caption Fu, I'm going now.

302
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,130
Can you have a look if this is what you want?

303
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,130
Yes.

304
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,940
Miss Xiao, morning.

305
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,110
Mr. Guo, what's up?

306
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,050
Yes. I want to ask about something.

307
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,330
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

308
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,310
A private thing.

309
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,520
Whose private thing is it?

310
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,650
Aren't you really prepared to

311
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,500
publish the news of Mr. Qian's death?

312
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,330
Don't you even tell the family?

313
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,250
As Mr. Guo said that it was a private thing,

314
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,370
then why did you ask so many questions?

315
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,480
In order to hide the fact that your fiance

316
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,720
smoked the opium,

317
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,270
the news of his death could be smothered up and

318
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,900
you still came to work like a normal person.

319
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,960
I really don't understand what

320
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,270
such hard-hearted government officials' children

321
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,540
are thinking.

322
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,190
What is the most important thing that

323
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,130
Mr. Guo cares about when you live in society?

324
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,700
Fame?

325
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,850
Loyalty? Or reputation?

326
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,550
The thing that cares about most is having enough food for a living.

327
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,280
It's also correct.

328
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,930
But

329
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,520
the most important thing is the face

330
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,980
in the dealings with officialdom.

331
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,900
The engagement between Qian Zixian and me

332
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,930
was originally out of cooperation

333
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,180
instead of love.

334
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,260
It even can be said as a deal.

335
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,390
But I'm not a cold-blooded and ruthless person.

336
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,390
I also felt sad

337
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,940
when I saw he was dead.

338
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,290
Anyway, he was still a life.

339
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,060
I will definitely figure out

340
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,050
the cause of Qian Zixian's death.

341
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,150
If everything goes well,

342
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,090
those floating dead bodies will be destroyed together.

343
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,620
At that time, there is no evidence.

344
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,510
How do you investigate?

345
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,240
Who does say that I don't have the evidence?

346
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,230
The photos of a pile of floating dead bodies

347
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,190
only can prove what the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation said was true.

348
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,150
There were epidemics indeed.

349
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,090
And

350
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,290
Mr. Qian was dead indeed.

351
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,600
What could this be used?

352
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,240
It looks like

353
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,740
Junior Tientsin Mystic should know

354
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,840
more important clues.

355
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,200
Miss Xiao is really clever.

356
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,140
Tell me.

357
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,490
Though I'm a fabulous person among people,

358
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,530
I also can't do free work.

359
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,200
If Miss Xiao would love to do it,

360
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,160
we could help each other.

361
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,830
How do we help each other?

362
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,460
I had said that

363
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,960
I would like to ask about some things today.

364
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,070
As Miss Xiao works in the newspaper,

365
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,450
then it should not be a difficult thing

366
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,930
to investigate these years' published

367
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,560
or unpublished news material.

368
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,210
That is not difficult.

369
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,360
I want to know

370
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,670
when and where did happen

371
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,970
catastrophic flood in Tianjin city.

372
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,830
That's it?

373
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,950
If you help me find this,

374
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,290
I must tell you the result

375
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,680
of the cause of Mr. Qian's death.

376
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,700
You see it is really hot today.

377
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,910
I'm saying that you two gather your strength.

378
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,180
What are you chatting about all day long?

379
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,370
Got it, Mom.

380
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,010
You are also

381
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,890
more and more long-winded.

382
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,940
Yes.

383
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,440
Mr. Ding.

384
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,710
It's really you. Mr. Ding.

385
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,520
Hi. Hi.

386
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,220
What's up?

387
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,920
You did have fun in my Cang Cui Tower.

388
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,800
I want to ask

389
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,400
where can smoke the opium.

390
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,260
Smoke the opium?

391
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,150
Mr. Ding.

392
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,720
Though this is also an enjoyable thing,

393
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,590
the difference in the profession makes one feel worlds apart.

394
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,810
My place only has girls.

395
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,460
Thank you.

396
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,710
What is your rush? Sir.

397
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,040
I tell you that

398
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,150
even though I don't have the information in my mind,

399
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,750
but my girls might

400
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,750
have some clues.

401
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,150
What will they know?

402
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,420
The thing that

403
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,550
they should know and

404
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,710
they should not know

405
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,080
is pending you to ask.

406
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm going to ask.

407
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,890
Mr. Ding.

408
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,860
You really don't know the rules.

409
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,770
If you will ask the girls,

410
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,140
you will need to...

411
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,640
Then may I ask what kind of girl

412
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,540
that Mr. Ding wants?

413
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,620
What kind of girl do you have?

414
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,010
Some girls mainly serve alcoholics.

415
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,730
Some are gambling

416
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,370
and playing with gamblers.

417
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,870
And some girls' regular visitors

418
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,920
have someone who loves to smoke.

419
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,120
Yes, I just want this. I just want this.

420
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,670
But such girls are very expensive.

421
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,300
It's OK for any money.

422
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,130
Got it.

423
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,610
Guan Mei. It's time to serve the guest.

424
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,590
Both of you hold Mr. Ding for me.

425
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,680
Got it.

426
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,620
Mr. Ding.

427
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,630
Go. Mr. Ding.

428
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,450
Dance well.

429
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,220
Go up.

430
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,090
Twist.

431
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:18,950
Be quick.

432
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,970
Go.

433
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,780
They all go.

434
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,920
They are full of ten directions' areas.

435
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:45,260
They often show the power.

436
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,640
Go quickly. Go quickly.

437
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,390
The earlier you go, the earlier you will be reborn.

438
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,860
The earlier you go, the earlier you will be reborn.

439
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,130
You go quickly. Go quickly.

440
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,440
Everyone. Everyone. Everyone.

441
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,220
On that day,

442
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,720
my daughter Guying

443
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,420
saw you were pulled up.

444
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,040
But she was not willing to come here.

445
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,510
She was pulled to here by other people.

446
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,340
So I took my daughter to come here

447
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,720
and send you some money.

448
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,840
Let her see you leave in person.

449
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
If you want to badger someone,

450
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,530
you won't badger my daughter.

451
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,510
You badger that person

452
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,000
who salvaged you.

453
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,800
What are you talking about?

454
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,800
What did I say?

455
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,970
I'm getting rid of bad luck for you.

456
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,910
Are you really getting rid of bad luck for me?

457
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,040
Then what's this? What's this?

458
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,140
Life is suffering. Confess the retribution without being pressed.

459
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,910
Every good brother over there.

460
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,160
You remember to not trust people's words easily.

461
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,590
If you want to feel vindicated,

462
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,920
you still need nice people's help.

463
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,690
Everyone. Everyone. Everyone.

464
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,270
You must listen carefully.

465
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,670
Who is the nice person that builds the road?

466
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,690
Who is the ghost that blocks the road?

467
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,960
If you listen to the liar's words, you will not cross the Naihe Bridge.

468
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,090
You think about

469
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,930
how to be reborn and how to be a person.

470
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,860
It just takes a little time

471
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,580
to soak under the Naihe Bridge.

472
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,790
If you listen to the bastard's words

473
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,380
and go in the wrong direction,

474
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,370
then you will forever not be able to bounce back.

475
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,870
You said that it would not be able to bounce back if you listen to whose words

476
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,020
Do you dare to say it to me one more time?

477
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,960
Let you say. I let you say.

478
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,980
Bad luck.

479
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,030
You don't show respect.

480
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,510
You use dead people's things to smash me.

481
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,090
If you are capable, you can use the real money to smash me.

482
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,220
I use my face to catch it for you.

483
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,140
I smash.

484
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,570
I.

485
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,830
Mom. Stop fighting.

486
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,790
You let me touch dead people's things in the early morning.

487
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,010
No.

488
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,010
I have to wash in the river.

489
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,450
Deyou.

490
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,530
Deyou.

491
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,720
You bastard.

492
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,320
Anyway, he said that

493
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,060
he was not only smoking but also doing opium's business.

494
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,920
Did he say the place?

495
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,620
This. I can't remember clearly.

496
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,790
I have some impression.

497
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,960
I often heard him saying something.

498
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,300
What jasmine?

499
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,770
Jasmine.

500
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,220
Is this a code name or a place name?

501
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,560
Perhaps.

502
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,530
Perhaps.

503
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,860
Did he take you to go there?

504
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,880
Mr. Ding.

505
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,980
It is always solved at here.

506
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,240
A one-off interaction.

507
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,600
It's not allowed to take people out.

508
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,690
What's his look?

509
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,120
Anyway, he looks like a normal playboy's look.

510
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,490
Quite overdressed.

511
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,820
What's his name?

512
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,580
I don't know.

513
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,800
We usually don't ask guests' names.

514
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,200
Qian Zixian.

515
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,750
Are you sure?

516
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,930
Mr. Qian.

517
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:07,680
Every girl here knows him.

518
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,800
Any treatment should have payback.

519
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,420
God will listen to it.

520
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,960
Action.

521
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,690
Deyou.

522
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,920
Who do you want to scare?

523
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,900
How do I dare to scare you?

524
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,010
Just now, I didn't show respect and bickered with you.

525
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,070
After I slipped into the water to calm down, I think it was not appropriate.

526
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,280
Were you startled?

527
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,530
I buy you a drink to relax.

528
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,520
Don't I know your trick?

529
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,920
You just say what do you want.

530
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,340
It's fine.

531
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,120
I just truly want to buy you a drink.

532
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,040
But

533
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,580
can you help me have a look at

534
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,280
which place has this wine in Tianjin?

535
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,140
Don't keep this in mind. It's cooking wine.

536
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,070
Cooking wine?

537
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,870
Could you check it one more time?

538
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,930
You don't believe it.

539
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:08,840
I believe.

540
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,920
Where will you buy me a drink?

541
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,780
Chen Ji Restaurant.

542
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,040
Bye-bye. See you.

543
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,830
Deng Ying Tower.

544
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:13,530
Two meals.

545
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,600
You can't order Zhuang Yuan Hong.

546
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,469
It will be enough for cold dishes.

547
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,270
OK.

548
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,900
That is cooking wine.

549
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,830
Are you kidding me?

550
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,199
That is really cooking wine.

551
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,110
But

552
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
this is not an ordinary cooking wine.

553
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,429
This is a very immaculate cooking wine.

554
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,350
Only Gong Fucai's chef

555
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,210
has the right to use this cooking wine.

556
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,199
Regarding this cooking wine,

557
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,409
it shouldn't pour into the pot directly.

558
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
It should spill

559
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,010
along the side of the pan.

560
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,960
And you will see the pan inside.

561
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,409
The smell has

562
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,680
been in the dish.

563
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,230
That smell.

564
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,950
So

565
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,740
that ordinary restaurant

566
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
can't afford such immaculate cooking wine.

567
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,860
There are only Tian Bao Tower in the north of the city,

568
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,370
Wang Chuanchang's En Lai Shun,

569
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,540
and our concession's Ju Hua Grand Hotel.

570
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,040
Only these three restaurants.

571
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,280
You are really an old chowhound.

572
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,140
You. Do your skin get an itch?

573
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,350
You fighted me as you just said so.

574
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,900
Deyou, wait me.

575
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,560
Daughter. Daughter. Daughter.

576
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,670
-Deyou. 
 -Daughter.

577
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,730
Is the message true?

578
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,570
According to the evidence I have collected,

579
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,630
it's true.

580
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,250
Mr. Qian was not just simple to smoke the opium.

581
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,300
He also had the connection with the people who resaled opium

582
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,590
and did the business of opium.

583
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,700
Though Mr. Qian is dead,

584
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,970
the people who do the business with him are still alive.

585
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,670
After Mr. Qian is dead,

586
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,570
the connection is cut off.

587
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,420
They might come to find you.

588
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,520
Thus,

589
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,050
Miss Xiao, you should be careful.

590
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,740
Thank you for Mr. Ding's reminder.

591
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,110
As this is my family's scandal,

592
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,210
then let my family deal with it.

593
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,870
The reason why Mr. Ding specially came here

594
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,840
was not just to send me a reminder.

595
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,000
I did have one thing.

596
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,780
Before Mr. Qian died, he said a word.

597
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,060
Lan.

598
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,960
Jasmine.

599
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,970
Miss Xiao. Do you know what does it mean?

600
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,130
♫I can't get your love.♫

601
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,390
♫It's like there is no oxygen in the air.♫

602
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:41,660
♫Your feature is everywhere.♫

603
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,700
♫You give me a lot of gentle feelings.♫

604
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,540
Miss Xiao. Come in, please.

605
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,330
Miss Xiao.

606
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,180
Please.

607
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,080
It depends on what does Mr. Ding want to eat.

608
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,010
Miss Xiao.

609
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,830
Why did you take me to Ju Hua Grand Hotel?

610
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,810
I'm familiar with here. This is the place of my engagement.

611
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,900
Where is the jasmine?

612
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,540
No hurry. Eat first.

613
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,040
OK.

614
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,790
Yummy.

615
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,140
This is this place's brand.

616
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,080
During my engagement ceremony,

617
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,230
didn't you taste it?

618
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,220
I

619
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,780
really don't care about food,

620
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,940
so I don't remember even if I did eat it before.

621
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,060
This doesn't like a playboy.

622
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,940
♫Look. A jasmine♫

623
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,720
♫is in blossom under the moonlight.♫

624
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,460
This. Is this jasmine?

625
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,850
♫Only remember it.♫

626
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,090
♫If it is favored by god.♫
