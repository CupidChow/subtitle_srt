1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,410
The story goes on.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,590
In the last chapter,

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,360
Guo Deyou, Ding Mao and Gu Ying

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,560
sneaked into the hospital's morgue.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,560
They found that Xiao Lanlan had already there.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,810
Qian Zixian's body was in the morgue just as they had expected.

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,960
Ding Mao did an autopsy, finding that there was something strange on the bodies.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,920
They had varix, and their vessels being violet. They seemed to be infected.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,120
But Qian Zixian didn't have the symptoms.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,990
Moreover, all people were poisoned.

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,740
Guo Deyou had to light the cigarette to analyze their grievances.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,720
He found they all had taken opium.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,200
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao split into two directions

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,820
to probe into the origin of opium.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,230
They all noticed the Juhua Grand Hotel in the concession.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,120
They decided to lure the backstage manipulator.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,410
They gathered at the Juhua Hotel

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,510
and caused uproar in the opium hall.

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,060
Guo Deyou distinguished himself.

21
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,810
He wisely caught Manager Wang.

22
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,220
♪See a jasmine flower♪

23
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,970
♪blooming in the moonlight♪

24
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,500
Is this song the Jasmine Flower?

25
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,860
I met Qian Zixian here

26
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,990
though the meeting was an arrangement by my family.

27
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,410
The first time I heard this song

28
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,450
was here.

29
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,010
So as soon as you mentioned the Jasmine Flower,

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,240
I thought of this place.

31
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,900
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,100
I have made you think about the sad affair.

33
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,510
It couldn't be described as a sad affair.

34
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,440
It was an annoying affair at most.

35
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,710
But whenever others mentioned this engagement,

36
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,010
I would feel a little upset.

37
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,500
Thinking from your point of view,

38
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,520
I can understand it.

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,910
Did you live abroad alone?

40
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,860
You are unrestrained.

41
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,980
How can you understand me?

42
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,890
My father was forced to do it by me.

43
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,560
So he sent me abroad.

44
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,000
At that time, I thought

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,540
I would be free if I could leave this place.

46
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,670
But I have returned here now.

47
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,060
Because my family has the only son.

48
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,470
Now think about it.

49
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,040
The previous years

50
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,520
seem to have been spent for others.

51
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,570
So we have the same complaint, and we can sympathize with each other.

52
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,950
We also have the same worry, and we can save each other.

53
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,620
If you think it in this way,

54
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,030
this is true.

55
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,070
Just as one of the Chinese operas writes:

56
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,640
Mounts are in the west while seas are in the east.

57
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,300
Mounts and seas are interconnected.

58
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,890
Friends are in every corner of the world.

59
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,150
They can meet each other everywhere.

60
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,940
Cheers.

61
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,540
This way please.

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,320
This way please.

68
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,770
Guests, what would you like to order?

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Water.

70
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,290
A pot of hot tea first.

71
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,040
Sorry, we don't offer hot water.

72
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,720
No hot water.

73
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,220
What do you offer?

74
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,230
We have red wine, juice

75
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,160
and soda water.

76
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,340
Soda water would be refreshing.

77
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,630
We'll order it.

78
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,080
We also want to have two of your specialties.

79
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,350
Okay. Please wait.

80
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,640
Guo Deyou.

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,409
We're just going to have a meal.

82
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,760
Why are you particular about it?

83
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,010
You bring me here.

84
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,100
We can also listen to music.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,870
Do you have anything important

86
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,070
to say to me?

87
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,060
You say.

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,930
I have prepared well.

89
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,340
What is this song?

90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,390
It sounds embarrassing.

91
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,550
I haven't heard of it.

92
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,830
I think it's great.

93
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,550
Your soda water.

94
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,190
What is the song they are singing on the stage?

95
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,550
The song they are singing is called the Jasmine Flower.

96
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,760
It originates from the Song of Flowers

97
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,700
that Zhang Sheng sang to tease Yingying in the Romance of West Chamber.

98
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,750
The gentlemen love to bring the ladies to listen to it.

99
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,070
This song is quite popular here.

100
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,000
Is the song about the flowers?

101
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,170
It is outwardly about the flowers.

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,190
In fact,

103
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,910
it is about the true love between young men and women.

104
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,380
You don't need to do anything now.

105
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,120
Hurry up and leave.

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,150
Okay. Please enjoy.

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,630
You say, you can just

108
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,380
appreciate me in your heart.

109
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,370
You always do the useless things.

110
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,820
The water has a strong fresh taste .

111
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,980
The taste has reached to my nose.

112
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,310
Now it seems that

113
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,470
Guo Deyou is the most comfortable person.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,550
He doesn't need to think about anything.

115
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,870
He is full means his family is full.

116
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,260
Everyone has his or her own fate.

117
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,130
We don't need to compare with others.

118
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,800
Because of the sudden death of Chairman Ding,

119
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,150
all the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

120
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,640
have to be dealt with by you.

121
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,040
It's not easy for Young Master Ding

122
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,230
to manage the affairs under the current condition.

123
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,560
If I were you,

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I would make the things in a mess.

125
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,669
Young Master Ding.

126
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,340
Why do you want to find the jasmine flower?

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,960
In this this hotel,

128
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,800
besides having meals and singing songs,

129
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,190
what else can we do?

130
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,410
Mom said that girls should be reserved.

131
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,310
So I can't always follow you.

132
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,690
But I'm willing to follow you.

133
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,700
I feel relieved when I see you.

134
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,080
I always behave in this way.

135
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,410
Do you find me annoying?

136
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,370
Of course.

137
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,670
You are speaking not what you are thinking.

138
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,430
If you really find me annoying,

139
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,630
you wouldn't bring me to this place.

140
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,980
Do you have money in your pocket?

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,360
Look at the people around you.

142
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,900
They are young rich men

143
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,820
like Ding Mao.

144
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,460
Or they are young ladies

145
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,520
who are descendants of an offical family like Xiao Lanlan.

146
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,830
If you don't have any money in your pocket,

147
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,440
how dare you come to this place to have a meal?

148
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,320
You... You don't have money.

149
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,500
But I have taken you here.

150
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
To tell the truth, I can accept the simple food.

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,540
As long as I can follow you,

152
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,090
everything I have eaten would be tasty.

153
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,700
Let's leave now.

154
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,210
The dishes have not been served yet.

155
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,900
I suddenly want to eat the Goubuli steamed buns.

156
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,800
The dishes have not been served.

157
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,500
But you have drunk the water.

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,590
It's the foreign water.

159
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,670
Is the water expensive?

160
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,960
It's from the foreign wells.

161
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,520
And some people were sent to bring it back.

162
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,450
Do you think it's expensive?

163
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,400
The water sold in ordinary restaurants would be expensive.

164
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,910
But if the restaurant is not clean

165
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,150
and the guests have found something wrong,

166
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,920
not only the water

167
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,620
but also the meal would be free.

168
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,940
What do you mean, Deyou?

169
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,220
Gu Ying.

170
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,250
You should sit still.

171
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,600
What will happen later

172
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
is likely to be unexpected.

173
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,830
But if I cause some trouble,

174
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,780
you should bear it together with me.

175
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,950
The trouble?

176
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,210
A rat.

177
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,040
A big rat.

178
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,710
Waiter, there is a rat.

179
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,430
Come here. It's a rat.

180
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,100
Don't stamp on it.

181
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,050
There. There.

182
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,230
There. There.

183
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,080
It's running that way.

184
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,900
There. It's running there.

185
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,300
It's running out. My god

186
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,380
There. There. There.

187
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,220
The rat is there.

188
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,740
Rat. Rat.

189
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,380
It's not here.

190
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,770
It's running that way.

191
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,230
Be careful.

192
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,220
There. There. There.

193
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,950
Guo Deyou?

194
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,730
Deyou.

195
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,150
They go straight to the back without having meals.

196
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,970
And someone is guarding there.

197
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,710
There must be something wrong.

198
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,670
What are you going to do?

199
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,990
Don't ask too much.

200
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,010
I don't have time to explain it.

201
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,870
Act according to circumstances.

202
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,070
What time is it?

203
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,740
I guess it's about

204
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,130
four or five o'clock.

205
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,540
Calculating from the solar altitude,

206
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,960
it's after five but less than six now.

207
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,630
Please go back.

208
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:19,130
-You need to listen to my call of helpers. 
-What are you doing?

209
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,690
Don't waste your words.

210
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,460
Go.

211
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,100
Sorry. Sorry.

212
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,880
Good afternoon, young masters and ladies.

213
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,430
Which one would you like, a private room or the hall?

214
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,470
A private room.

215
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,390
Okay.

216
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,220
Follow me.

217
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,050
Go. Deyou.

218
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,210
This way, please.

219
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,410
Please come in.

220
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,250
Sit wherever you want, my guests.

221
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,640
What do you want to have today?

222
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,310
We want to have the most expensive one.

223
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,190
This young master knows how to enjoy himself.

224
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,290
Wait a minute.

225
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,610
Guo Deyou, what's wrong with you?

226
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,630
It doesn't matter.

227
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,440
Tianjin has banned smoking for so many years.

228
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,150
Anti-smoking Campaign

229
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,020
is only a slogan, with no action at all.

230
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,340
Ying, ying.

231
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,180
What's wrong with you, second brother?

232
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,660
Second brother, are you OK?

233
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,650
Second brother, second brother.

234
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,300
You.

235
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,130
Stand still.

236
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,910
What time is it now?

237
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,530
Alright, go, go.

238
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,070
It's no wonder that we were asked about the time.

239
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,610
It turns out that pocket watches are their passes.

240
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,030
Second brother, second brother.

241
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,490
Second brother, second brother.

242
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,100
Ding Mao, Ding Mao, my second brother is not well.

243
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,670
Guo Deyou.

244
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,540
Guo Deyou.

245
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,940
The prepared opium paste for you is here.

246
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,040
Do you need it right now?

247
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,390
We might need to use the toilet.

248
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,400
Right, right, right.

249
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,450
To the toilet. To the toilet.

250
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,320
What's wrong with you?

251
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,960
We are going to the toilet.

252
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,850
To the toilet.

253
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,600
What time is is?

254
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,410
Run!

255
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,110
Stop.

256
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,750
-Quickly. Go. /N -Stop!

257
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,420
Fast.

258
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,849
Go.

259
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,560
Ding Mao.

260
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,330
Second brother Guo.

261
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,290
Go.

262
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,320
Second Brother.

263
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,420
Where are you going, second brother?

264
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,490
Guo Deyou, the exit is this way.

265
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,150
Second brother, second brother.

266
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,040
Guo Deyou.

267
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,380
Second brother.

268
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,110
Guo Deyou.

269
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,780
How do you know that there is a hidden room here?

270
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,190
This is very rare in the north.

271
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,130
What?

272
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,630
This is loquat, a seedling of loquat.

273
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,900
Stop chatting.

274
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,030
Let's find a way out.

275
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,180
Second brother cannot smell smoke,

276
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,130
let alone the smell of opium.

277
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,390
Second brother, second brother.

278
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,920
Second brother.

279
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,050
This is a way out.

280
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,800
Go, go, go. Let's go.

281
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,690
Stop!

282
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,570
Go fast!

283
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,430
Make way. Make way. Make way.

284
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,250
Step aside.

285
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,660
The police is dealing with a case. Make way for us.

286
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,340
Come on. Make way.

287
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,900
The police is dealing with a case.

288
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,460
Making such a noise.

289
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,350
Seems to be urgent.

290
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,720
Dizzy.

291
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,470
Name, address and time range of smoking,

292
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,770
ask them these questions clearly.

293
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,520
Yes, sir.

294
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,800
Go, go.

295
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:06,930
Go.

296
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,850
Fast. Go.

297
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,990
Go, go.

298
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,040
Wait.

299
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,140
Who is in charge at your place?

300
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,720
Boss Wang.

301
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,120
Where is he?

302
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,360
I don't know. I have never seen him.

303
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,570
Never seen him.

304
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,730
Go, go, go.

305
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,530
Move fast.

306
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,060
Follow up. Follow up.

307
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,580
Second brother. Drink some water.

308
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,450
Faster. Faster.

309
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,290
Faster. I'm tell you.

310
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,300
Move faster.

311
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Stand up right.

312
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,390
All stand up right.

313
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,320
Staff and smokers in different groups.

314
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,180
In different groups.

315
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,490
Quickly.

316
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,730
Detective Ding.

317
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,800
Captain Fu. You worked hard.

318
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,280
Look what you are saying.

319
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,170
It's like a slap in my face.

320
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,350
It has only been one day,

321
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,830
and you have found such a big opium store.

322
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,570
The annual quota of our department is achieved.

323
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,080
Thanks to you,

324
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,950
we can all rest for the next half year.

325
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,440
Captain Fu, I will just be straight.

326
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,400
We are at the scene of the crime,

327
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,010
so we only talk about the case now.

328
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,870
Is that alright?

329
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,450
Sure, sure.

330
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,450
Please.

331
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,290
Who is the owner of the opium store? Have you found it?

332
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,490
I have asked them all.

333
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,810
They said that there is a Boss Wang,

334
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,450
but nobody had ever seen him.

335
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,020
Never seen him...

336
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,740
Such a big opium store.

337
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,930
How did it work

338
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,120
without an operator?

339
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,590
The staff said

340
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,440
that the boss didn't participate in the operation.

341
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,730
I guess that he either ran away in the mess,

342
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,950
or he never had shown up.

343
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,330
Have you searched their office

344
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,560
and the notes in it?

345
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,920
And who they had contacted

346
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,200
and the big clients that had come by?

347
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,440
No clue at all.

348
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,960
Such a big restaurant.

349
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,500
Such big wholesale volume.

350
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,650
How could it be no clue at all?

351
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,200
Do you think it make sense?

352
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,320
If detective Ding doesn't think it make sense,

353
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,720
it makes no sense.

354
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,760
Then,

355
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,800
let's arrest them all back to our office,

356
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,730
and interrogate them all.

357
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,170
Then how much time will it take me?

358
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,350
It depends on you.

359
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,320
I will keep my promise,

360
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,670
giving you the full responsibility for the opium case.

361
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,390
As a special detective,

362
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,030
this is your duty.

363
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,090
Alright.

364
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,600
I have got enough information for this case.

365
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,160
There are some critical cases in the office

366
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,870
that must be investigated by me,

367
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,820
so I really don't have time to help you.

368
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,070
There,

369
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,320
I will leave some people for you at the entrance,

370
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,790
and leave now.

371
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,970
Let's go.

372
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,740
What are you doing?

373
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,910
The sorceress is teaching you how to practice divination?

374
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,160
Boss Wang,

375
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,140
you must be tired.

376
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,580
You have mistaken me.

377
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,750
Can you explain the prepared opium paste on your finger?

378
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,540
Working at such a place,

379
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,230
it is not surprise that I touch anything.

380
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,020
We can touch any dirty stuff at any time.

381
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,100
How could I know where I get it?

382
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,590
What about the smell of smoke in you?

383
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,350
You make good joke, Mr..

384
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,960
As a waitress at an opium store,

385
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,780
who could avoid the smell of smoke?

386
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,510
Obvious smoke can be smelled from all the others.

387
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,800
Only from you,

388
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,610
the smoke is not only very weak,

389
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,980
but also misty,

390
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,400
with a weak aroma in it.

391
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,090
Is it? What aroma?

392
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,710
Come, dog nose.

393
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,650
Aren't you the most familiar with cosmetics?

394
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,650
Smell it and find what aroma it is.

395
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,950
Make way.

396
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,650
The cosmetics are not rare.

397
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,330
But the soap

398
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,090
is really finicking.

399
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,070
Say some details.

400
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,510
Jianan eaglewood, Songpan musk,

401
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,710
pearl, powder of jade and roses.

402
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,760
You have spent much money.

403
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,500
I have hated the smell of smoke since I was little,

404
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,030
so all the prescriptions that could cover the smell

405
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,120
were all applied to me by my master.

406
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,780
The soap made from these spices

407
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,810
has the effect of expelling the smoke, holding the fragrance, and keeping people calm.

408
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,630
The fragrance is light and is hard to notice.

409
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,960
Mr., you are really an expert.

410
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,070
I am like you,

411
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,610
disliking the smell of smoke.

412
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,150
I would feel sick after smelling much of it,

413
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,180
so I use this soap every day.

414
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,960
Every day.

415
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,340
Such soap made from expensive spices.

416
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,110
It is not for ordinary people.

417
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,600
I'm a woman.  We can save the money for food and drink

418
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,500
and use it on this aspect.

419
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,450
Moreover, I am working at such a place.

420
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,610
I have read the details of your accounts

421
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,000
in the opium store.

422
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,370
You guess what I have smelled from it.

423
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,430
Jianan eaglewood, Songpan musk,

424
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,280
pearl, powder of jade and roses.

425
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,720
You are the only one here

426
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,440
with such kind of fragrance.

427
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,000
Accounts are secret files that

428
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,530
not everyone can get in touch.

429
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,480
Do you still deny that you are Boss Wang?

430
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,080
So what?

431
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,090
Although the soap is expensive,

432
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,090
it is not that rare.

433
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,910
What you said could only prove that

434
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,220
Boss Wang used the same kind of soap as me.

435
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,780
But it couldn't prove that I had been to the secret room

436
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,310
and touched the accounts.

437
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,430
Secret room?

438
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,460
Did I ever mention a secret room?

439
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,470
The account specifics

440
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,790
were accidently seen by me when Inspector Ding

441
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,210
was sealing it up.

442
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,420
I didn't know about

443
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,390
the secret room.

444
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,320
Come on.

445
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,390
Take her.

446
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,100
President.

447
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,150
Everything's the same.

448
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,550
The young master is safe now

449
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,320
and he has not done

450
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,420
anything wrong.

451
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,670
This must be the luck of our chamber of commerce.

452
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,470
President, there's no need to worry.

453
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,560
Uncle Hu.

454
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,120
Why are you still here so late?

455
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,210
At this time every night in the past,

456
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,510
your father would always be coughing.

457
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,650
But now I can't hear it anymore.

458
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,710
I don't think I'm used to it.

459
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,570
These are fresh loquats from Dongting.

460
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,660
Good for your lungs. Have one.

461
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,000
But your father can't have them now.

462
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,470
What he had was a bronchial disease.

463
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,180
Loguats have no use to him.

464
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,060
But he liked the taste.

465
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,480
Sour but cool.

466
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,970
This could make your throat feel better.

467
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,720
Does the loguat bear fruit easily?

468
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,950
Why do you ask?

469
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,530
I think the loguat has great vitality.

470
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,940
You randomly spit the pit in a flowerpot

471
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,750
and you'll get a sprout.

472
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,520
Uncle Hu.

473
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,990
Are you hiding something from me?

474
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,390
Why would I do that?

475
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,190
The record of the incoming and outgoing of opium?

476
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,770
Why do you have this?

477
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,090
In the Juhua Restaurant,

478
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,190
there is a secret tobacco house.

479
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,960
And in the tobacco house there is a secret room.

480
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,450
In the drawer of the secret room's desk

481
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,420
lied this record.

482
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,650
Do you recognize the signature on the record?

483
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:44,250
There was also a pot of orchids in the corner

484
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,700
where there was a sprout.

485
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,380
A loguat sprout.

486
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,360
This is loguat!

487
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,830
Is the chamber also involved in this kind of business, too?

488
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,220
No way.

489
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,830
In order to hand the chamber over

490
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,370
to you on a firm footing,

491
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,430
the president asked us to strictly select

492
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,160
all the goods we had been handling all these years.

493
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,270
But we would've never get involved with those shady business.

494
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,670
The gods are watching us.

495
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,290
I have no idea why

496
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,560
your father's signature is on it, either.

497
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,030
Since Uncle Hu also doesn't know about the fact,

498
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,080
I think I'll look into it myself.

499
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,350
Young master.

500
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,720
Selling opium is capital felony.

501
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,540
Before everything is out and clear,

502
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,990
young master must keep it a secret.

503
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,330
The president is gone now

504
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,890
so you can't verify everything.

505
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,900
What if

506
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,310
trouble is caused along the way

507
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,500
and do harm to the chamber

508
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,210
or do harm to you?

509
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,700
President Ding lived an open and above board life.

510
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,460
The chamber's and his reputation can't be destroyed.

511
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,760
Even if you, Uncle Hu, won't tell me,

512
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,980
I can dig it out myself.

513
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,870
Boss Wang.

514
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,469
We're both no fools.

515
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,010
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

516
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,670
Opium has been forbidden for years in Tianjin City.

517
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,110
Such a big deal

518
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,239
and such a big amount of incoming

519
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,650
are kind of impossible to not attract attention from the higher level governments.

520
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,409
I just want to know

521
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,219
what you did to

522
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,040
keep the tobacco house safe.

523
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,690
Officer Ding, you're flattering me.

524
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm only covering for people.

525
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,980
I have nothing to do with

526
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,510
all the relationships in here.

527
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,490
The true owner of this tobacco house

528
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,020
is Childe Qian, Qian Zixian.

529
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,470
They only hired me

530
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,850
to take care of the employees.

531
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,890
Boss Wang, do you come to the tobacco house everyday?

532
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,550
As long as there is a guest,

533
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,680
I'm always there.

534
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,300
Then do you remember

535
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,340
when was the last time

536
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,480
Childe Qian came?

537
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,870
He's busy.

538
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,280
He doesn't come a lot.

539
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,140
I can't really remember.

540
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,380
A few days ago,

541
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,720
Miss Xiao got engaged.

542
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,040
But Childe Qian, as the groom,

543
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
didn't even show up.

544
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,300
If I count the days,

545
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,020
it should have been half a month .

546
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,410
I've seen the account book.

547
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,400
Childe Qian must be addicted.

548
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,020
I saw that he came once in a while.

549
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,210
As the manager of the tobacco house,

550
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,270
didn't you wonder why he had not shown up

551
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,430
for more than half a month?

552
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,130
Since old times,

553
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,470
it's been only right for employers to care about employees' life.

554
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,390
It's never the other way round.

555
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,940
I only considered that

556
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,500
he was busy with something urgent

557
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,740
and had no time to come.

558
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,900
Boss Wang, do you remember

559
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,430
the floating body case on the Yaowa Whalf?

560
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,350
I heard about it.

561
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,830
More than one hundred people died.

562
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,810
But we have never made

563
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,100
the exact number of deaths public.

564
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,510
How did you know?

565
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,780
I... I heard about it from people on the street.

566
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,530
I didn't know about the truth.

567
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,410
What a coincidence!

568
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,440
More than one hundred is actually correct.

569
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,940
And

570
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
you know what?

571
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,630
They all had used opium before they died.

572
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,170
They died at different times,

573
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,710
but they were all soaked in the same place.

574
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,240
And there was this one night

575
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,390
when they all came out

576
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,860
floating on the surface of the river.

577
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,840
Who do you think

578
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,940
they should go to to right their wrong?

579
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,990
Every wrong has its cause and every debt has its debtor.

580
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,330
But I have nothing to do with it.

581
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,350
Money is what I want and what I get.

582
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,560
Officer Ding, you must look deep into it.

583
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,620
We have already.

584
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,380
You don't want us to reveal it for you.

585
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,120
You are a lady

586
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,770
so I'll not be rude.

587
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,490
But if you were a man,

588
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:31,320
you would've regretted.

589
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,180
Officer Ding,

590
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,820
do you believe in Buddhism?

591
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,520
I only believe in science.

592
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,020
One practises the Bodhisattva path for the next life.

593
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,240
What one wishes can only come

594
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,970
in the next life.

595
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,080
But this is retribution.

596
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,210
It never waits for your whole life.

597
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,130
What's your point?

598
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,640
Childe Qian managed to obtain some great stuff

599
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,870
out of nowhere.

600
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,800
It was said to be strong and pure

601
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,800
but also not very stable.

602
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,130
For it could kill people once in a while.

603
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,550
I talked to Childe Qian.

604
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,330
I said that it was immoral to sell opium.

605
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,250
We surely could make money happen but just not death.

606
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,890
We were still able to cover things up for a few times.

607
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,230
But if anyone dies,

608
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,670
no one could cover it up.

609
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,810
But Childe Qian said that

610
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,420
he was soon to be

611
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,170
the son-in-law of Secretary General Xiao.

612
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,870
If anything happened, the Xiao's could always be the shield.

613
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,420
But I was told to be responsible to get rid of

614
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,820
the dead bodies of the smokers.

615
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,900
Otherwise, he was going to put the blame on me.

616
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,520
I was frightened.

617
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,140
So I found some fellows

618
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,370
to help me find a deserted well in the north city

619
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,470
and threw the bodies in it

620
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,170
when no one was around at night.

621
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,220
And one day

622
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,670
Childe Qian got really drunk

623
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,120
and came to the tobacco house

624
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,260
asking to smoke the great stuff he had got.

625
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,120
We dared not to stop him.

626
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,230
That was the so-called retribution.

627
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,220
The dead smokers

628
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,660
had found him.

629
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,420
What about Qian's body?

630
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,530
Like other dead bodies,

631
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,650
it was thrown in that well also.

632
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,130
It was not a deserted well.

633
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,250
It was a drainage pipe which a deserted paper mill

634
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,530
secretly dug.

635
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,050
It was connected to the Yaowa Whalf.

636
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,290
Retribution.

637
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,890
Have you seen this?

638
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,150
Don't fool me with some great stuff.

639
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,750
They all died of cyanide poisoning.

640
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,860
Do you want me to keep doing this

641
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,190
with you until the sun comes up?

642
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,620
Officer Ding.

643
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,680
No. Master Ding.

644
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,720
Are you sure you want the answer?

645
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,210
I'm sure.

646
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,710
Before selling the great stuff,

647
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,640
the tobacco house got the incoming goods

648
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,570
all from the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

649
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:47,530
and directly through President Ding Yiqiu.

650
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,380
Retribution.

651
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,680
Something no one can get rid of it.
