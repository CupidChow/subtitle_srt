1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,260
The story continues to be told from last episode.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,390
In last episode, we mentioned that

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,710
Ding Mao continued to be the chairman of the chamber of commerce of water transportation of grain to the capital.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,680
He found half teeth from the wound of

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
Feng Erma's dead body.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,980
And he concluded that

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,820
the killer didn't have ring finger of the left hand.

9
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,030
Guo Deyou once again lighted up to analyze grievances.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,340
And he found out that it was a dead man who

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,180
bit Feng Erma to death.

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,150
The clue led to the red badge hatchet man of the chamber of commerce of water transporation of grain to the capital

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,850
Sun Laoqi who was already dead during the war.

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,820
Guo Deyou, Ding Mao and Gu Ying,

15
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,230
tried to dig the grove and do an autopsy.

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,870
But they found that there was no corpse in the coffin.

17
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,750
Then, they sneaked into the ghost market

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,530
and checked the nest of the grave robbers.

19
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,210
Those three found out after messing around with the thieves that

20
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,340
there was someone in the chamber of the commerce who payed to hire grave robbers

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,380
to steal the corpse of Sun Laoqi.

22
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,300
That led to

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,310
battle of liberal arts at the wharf and the living deads who came to mess up the game.

24
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,340
The detective Tientsin Mystic wanted to investigate the morgue again.

25
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,470
It was mentioned in the doctrine of  Demon Sect that

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,140
there were three steps in the biological evolution,

27
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,450
the survival of the fittest, law of the jungle and self-propogation.

28
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,350
Which step do you think

29
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,790
they are at now?

30
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,770
I never thought about that.

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,340
If human can evolve completely,

32
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,400
what would they live on?

33
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,720
Food, sunlight, water,

34
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:25,050
or intellect, desire, love?

35
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,160
They should need all of them.

36
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,329
Definitely not petty thicks.

37
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,800
People like Hu Haijiang,

38
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,020
doesn't have the intention to evolve himself

39
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,890
at all.

40
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,030
People like him are

41
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,980
benighted.

42
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,870
I did not expect him to have the balls.

43
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,620
It was the instinct of a dog who protects his owner.

44
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,600
All the behaviors which out of the instinct are

45
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,120
low-end behaviors.

46
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,570
Now matter how low his behavior was,

47
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,620
what he had done

48
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,829
affected our plans.

49
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,670
No, no, no, no.

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,340
there will be an chaos at the chamber of commerce

51
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,380
as we expected.

52
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,410
No,

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,430
even better than our expectation.

54
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,000
So when they find out what is going on

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,060
someday,

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,710
my cocoon has reinvent itself into a butterfly.

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,570
So you are saying, they.....

58
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,440
The evolution is a break through.

59
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,420
It is a break through!

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,090
At the chamber of commerce,

61
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,220
everybody has an identity card.

62
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,220
But,

63
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,780
the color of sealing wax print inside

64
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,700
are different.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,720
People who hold white badges are servants.

66
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,440
Wharf workers and sailers hold blue badges.

67
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,250
Guards like Tianming, Sun Laoqi

68
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,010
and Yu Si.

69
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,100
What they do

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,010
incur bloodshedding.

71
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,850
So they hold red badges.

72
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,210
It is Supervisor Hu who holds silver badge

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,090
on top of all the poeple.

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,330
Then, our young master Ding

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,880
must be the one

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,680
who holds the shining gold badge.

77
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,120
Show me quickly!

78
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,940
But there is a question.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,260
Feng Erma holds white badge,

80
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,590
but why did he wear water trousers?

81
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,710
He did not need to go to the wharf.

82
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,890
Right.

83
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,890
Why did he dig out Sun Laoqi's

84
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,930
corpse?

85
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,360
Therefore,

86
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,520
there must be someone who instigated Feng Erma.

87
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,090
Also, he was a white badge servant.

88
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,610
Where did he get the money to hire grave robbers?

89
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,450
Based on the things we know currently,

90
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,180
Feng Erma dug out Sun Laoqi,

91
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,340
Sun Laoqi came to life,

92
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,210
and bit Feng Erma to death.

93
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,330
The living dug out the dead,

94
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,890
and the dead bit the living to death.

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,090
It is impossible!

96
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,880
I don't want to believe it either.

97
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,020
But it seems like it now.

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,330
So,

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,140
there must be some details we don't know.

100
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,340
The Demon Sect!

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,540
Chariman Ding surely knows how to live the life,

102
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,410
these are

103
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,950
enough for us to eat for a week.

104
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,120
Hai, eat more!

105
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,350
It is time for you to grow.

106
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,370
Here you go!

107
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,790
Thanks.

108
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,910
Hai, what happened?

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,860
The river demon, the river demon!

110
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,210
The river demon, the river demon!

111
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:07,980
The river demon?

112
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,410
Hai, what came to your mind?

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,290
The river demon, the river demon bites people.

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,860
Talk slowly, talk slowly.

115
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,960
My father....

116
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
My father was bitten by

117
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,300
the river demon to death.

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,140
You were there?

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,750
Don't worry,  I am here.

120
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Hai,

121
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,630
do you still remember how the river demon looked like?

122
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,230
River demon does not exist!

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,300
Hai, think carefully.

124
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,700
Was there someone who killed your father?

125
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,040
Tell us what did you see.

126
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,650
What happened on that day?

127
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,460
Hai, Hai.

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,760
Hai, tell me what happened.

129
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,560
Dad.

130
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,660
Why are you here?

131
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,590
Go back!

132
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,730
This kid...

133
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,690
I am not going back!

134
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,980
I will go wherever you go.

135
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,730
Why are you following me?

136
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,700
It's dangerous here, you cannot stay here.

137
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,370
Dad, who are you looking for?

138
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,540
You haven't accompany me to sleep for several days.

139
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,690
I don't have the time to coax you.

140
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,660
Go back!

141
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,360
Otherwise, I will not cook for you tomorrow!

142
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,150
Hide!

143
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,370
Don't come out!

144
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,340
I will make ice-sugar gourds for you tomorrow.

145
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,290
Alright!

146
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,650
Am I good at coaxing kids?

147
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,160
Be serious!

148
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,050
Then you should praise me!

149
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:27,960
What should I say?

150
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,410
You can say I am good at coaxing kids.

151
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,430
You are so good at coaxing kids.

152
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,700
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

153
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,510
What's the matter with the river demon?

154
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,250
The river demon which Hai mentioned should be a person,

155
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,630
he or she jumped out of the water,

156
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,930
and bit Feng Erma to death.

157
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,080
Wait, I am a little confused.

158
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,650
I, let me clear my thoughts.

159
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,290
No.

160
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,590
Feng Erma hired someone to

161
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,540
dig Sun Laoqi out of his tomb,

162
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,100
then Sun Laoqi jumped out of the water and

163
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,180
bit Feng Erma to death.

164
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,570
Don't you only believe in the science, chairman Ding?

165
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,840
Explain this in science

166
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,360
to me!

167
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,520
Don't worry!

168
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,700
I will find

169
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,190
a scientific way to explain to you!

170
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,970
Great! I will be expecting.

171
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,180
So we have two directions now.

172
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,330
One,

173
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,470
find out who hired Feng Erma to

174
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,250
dig out Sun Laoqi's body.

175
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,530
Two,

176
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,280
find Sun Laoqi.

177
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,830
Feng Erma is a member of the chamber of commerce.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,010
Let me ask around when I get back.

179
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,260
Should not be difficult to find something.

180
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
Sun Laoqi,

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,140
was dig out from his grave.

182
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,210
So he should be a dead man.

183
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,240
This dead man

184
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,840
appeared in the river for the last time.

185
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,890
So,

186
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,910
we need to look for him in the river.

187
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,950
Makes sense.

188
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,630
So who will be good under water?

189
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,190
It is our leader of corpse retrieval team of the Wu River;

190
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,250
Guo Deyou.

191
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,670
And who will I look for

192
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,790
under the water?

193
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,490
It is the red badge guard of our chamber of commerce of water transportation of grain to the capitaL; Sun Laoqi.

194
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,250
So,

195
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,830
isn't it like this?

196
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,680
The chairman of chamber of commerce Ding Mao,

197
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,460
asked the leader of corpse retrieval team of the Wu River Guo Deyou

198
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,460
to fish for the corpse of an member of chamber of commerce.

199
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,350
Isn't it correct?

200
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,250
Correct!

201
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,320
Pay me!

202
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,140
How much?

203
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,690
One hundred!

204
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,780
You said fifty last time, I...

205
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,320
It is dangerous this time, the thing bites.

206
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,270
Who else did Feng Erma have in his family?

207
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,900
Feng Erma lived alone.

208
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,340
He had a son.

209
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,710
Nobody else.

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,060
So who he worked for?

211
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
For Hu's family. Since Tianming went away,

212
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,420
there were not too much work to do.

213
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,030
The main work was to help Ms. Hu to

214
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,540
take care of supervisor Hu.

215
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,400
Poor Hai.

216
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,210
He was left alone.

217
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,800
Don't worry

218
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,440
We'll take good care of our brother's son

219
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,790
I feel like Yishengmen is intended to

220
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,530
Bring trouble to us by this opportunity

221
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,310
We may not get what we want by verbal fight

222
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,950
No matter what happens

223
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,530
After the fight

224
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,300
I'll tell our brothers

225
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,720
to make arrangements for funeral and other things

226
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,590
By the way

227
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,200
When was the verbal fight scheduled

228
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,150
Tonight

229
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,310
How's preparation going

230
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,900
Don't worry

231
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,050
I'm here

232
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,810
I'll go too tonight

233
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,790
Great

234
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,380
If you can be there

235
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,840
Our brothers will be really encouraged

236
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,430
But I have to remind you

237
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,320
You can only go watch it

238
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,430
You can't join in the fight

239
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,280
I know

240
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,830
How can I join the verbal fight

241
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,210
It'll be bullying them

242
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,230
Yes you are right

243
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,210
Ok this is it

244
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,800
I'll go get ready for tonight

245
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,320
Young Master Guo

246
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,970
The hole on this net is so big

247
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,270
What can we catch

248
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,120
We'll only catch big ones

249
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,070
Don't be silly

250
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,150
How big has the fish be to be caught by this net

251
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,210
Extremely big

252
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,190
Really

253
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,390
Chairman

254
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,760
Is Aunt Hu in the study or bedroom

255
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,350
She's left to visit her parents

256
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
She's left

257
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,990
Mrs. Hu just lost her son

258
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,110
Her husband was locked in the prison

259
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,970
Mrs. Hu was very upset

260
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,370
She went back home to rest for some time

261
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,420
Ok

262
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
Dahongpao from Mount Wuyi

263
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,280
Although it's not from the two mother trees

264
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,630
It's still one of a kind

265
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,470
We'll just wait here

266
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,260
The actors can only go on stage

267
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,900
once the light's up

268
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,720
Gentlemen

269
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,740
It's been a long way

270
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,000
Lots of you present here

271
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,070
Including myself Yu Si

272
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,450
Followed our former chairman and risked our lives

273
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,810
To gain the foundation of the Chamber

274
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,840
"Armies are trained for a thousand days to fight for an hour"

275
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,000
Now the Chamber is facing crisis

276
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,910
And it's in the need of you

277
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,410
Let's show Yishengmen in today's verbal fight

278
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,420
The heroism of Caoyun gentlemen

279
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,490
Yes Yes Yes

280
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,430
Let's draw lots

281
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,410
Master Si

282
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,750
Are you acting out an opera

283
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,050
Yelling and wrangling

284
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,290
Pretentious

285
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,370
Tientsin men should be straightforward

286
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,720
Cut out all the nonsense

287
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,520
Master Cui hold your horses

288
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,000
You are a householder

289
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,100
Don't make a fool of yourself

290
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,470
Of whom

291
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,220
I don't care

292
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,460
The joke's on the cowards

293
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,510
Yishengmen are the guests from afar

294
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,940
Please

295
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,540
What's this for

296
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,660
Verbal fight

297
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,740
Everyone

298
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,040
I came here in a rush

299
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,750
No time for preparing gifts

300
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,680
Here's one ear

301
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,350
Just a snack for our Caoyun brothers

302
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,500
You call this verbal fight

303
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,290
Right

304
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,120
What's armed fight then

305
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,870
That time when Tianming and Sun Laoqi

306
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,220
fought together to guard the dock was armed fight

307
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,350
Armed fight is fight for life

308
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,560
It relies on kung fu and luck

309
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,260
While verbal fight is fight for fierceness

310
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,910
It relies on courage and vigour

311
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,600
You knew I didn't mean it back then

312
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,650
I knew

313
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,140
But the rivals didn't know

314
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,180
You are a man of actions

315
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,460
Chairman

316
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
You can't take back your words

317
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,190
Some rules are not to be broken

318
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,810
Please brother

319
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,670
Will an ear suffice

320
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,550
I'll give you an arm for bonus

321
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,350
Captain

322
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,900
Is it ok for us to just sit here

323
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,130
What's wrong

324
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,220
Do we need to go check

325
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,690
Which side should we pick if we go there

326
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,560
But look at them

327
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,590
All swaggering around

328
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,190
We should let them know

329
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,150
Who's in charge of Tientsin

330
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,480
Ok

331
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,310
Go

332
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,280
Go let them know

333
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,670
Who's in charge of Tientsin

334
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,500
You go

335
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,700
Captain

336
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm not qualified

337
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,140
It has to be you

338
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,870
The verbal fight

339
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,370
It should be a solution

340
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,690
Which is civil and scientific

341
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,990
They solve their own problems

342
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,010
And not adding to our trouble at the police office

343
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,280
This is what big gangs do

344
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,110
They are saving us from trouble

345
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
Let them fight

346
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,170
We just stand by and watch

347
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,040
As long as there's no big trouble

348
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,740
We can just turn a blind eye to it

349
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,240
Do you understand

350
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,680
Wise

351
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,410
Captain I admire you so much

352
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,390
Watch and learn

353
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,520
Papa is a little bit thirsty today

354
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,280
I'm craving for something hot

355
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,620
Bottoms up

356
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,250
Sun Laoqi

357
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,940
What did you say

358
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,390
This is Sun Laoqi

359
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,010
He's Sun Laoqi

360
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,510
He swam faster than a tortoise

361
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,570
I chased for almost one kilometer

362
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,310
Don't just watch

363
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,150
Come and help

364
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,230
Help

365
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,240
Be quick

366
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,820
pull!

367
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,440
Laoqi

368
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,870
what's going on

369
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,770
one hundred silver remember to pay up

370
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:41,780
it is sick

371
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,700
It ‘s burning

372
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,450
what’s burning

373
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,340
head

374
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,130
Are you serious

375
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,860
move out

376
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,130
what's up

377
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,730
Couldn't sleep in the night and have a grand party

378
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,890
did you get some

379
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,130
what's going on

380
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,250
Captain Fu

381
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,630
give us justice

382
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,770
CaoYun set us up

383
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,960
Crazy Cui

384
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,640
did you grow another head

385
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,450
what do you mean

386
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,480
you made such a scene

387
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,300
on the wharf

388
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,000
want the police's help

389
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,040
to bring you justice

390
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,300
go figure

391
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,880
give me a reason

392
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,310
maybe I like it

393
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,600
Tianjing society is part of Jianghu

394
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,040
we have rules to follow in Jianghu

395
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,820
my brothers do not

396
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,260
loot and plunder

397
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,540
because we live by

398
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,040
the rules of Jianghu

399
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,480
Have you respected to the rules of Jianghu

400
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,360
To all the gangs from Tianjing

401
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,200
Jianghu has rules

402
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,900
if you want to settle

403
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,790
have I ever interfere

404
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,160
what now

405
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,770
what 's wrong

406
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,770
make up new rules as we go

407
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,410
good heaven

408
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,060
dip head in fried oil

409
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,060
then light it up on the wharf

410
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,260
do you want to burn the place down

411
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,220
to decided the winning

412
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,020
I can't take this responsibility

413
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,980
can't you (Door of Life) think it over with your head

414
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,220
Captain FU

415
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,050
He is not one of ours

416
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,900
this is Sun Laoqi from Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

417
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,630
you missed him

418
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,270
Caoyun 's people

419
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,550
he is a thug

420
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,590
they did these to their own

421
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,090
now he bites everyone

422
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,680
I bet the other thug Feng Erma

423
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,530
was bitten and killed by him

424
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,510
they try to set up Door of Life

425
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,420
since they changed a chairman

426
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,280
no one follows the rules anymore

427
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,570
today's verbal match

428
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,930
they bring a living dead man Sun Laoqi

429
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,760
no problem

430
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,280
I 'll take you all the way until the end

431
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,890
It is no use pretending you did not know

432
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,360
Today's verbal match

433
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,550
Chamber of commerce won for sure

434
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,900
bullshit

435
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,150
who is Sun Laoqi

436
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,020
crap

437
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,190
regardless live

438
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,310
or dead

439
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,620
he is one of us

440
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,100
fried his head in oil

441
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,300
then burn it with fire

442
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,240
Didn't you see that

443
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,770
You sent a dead man to verbal match

444
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,160
broke the rule

445
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,710
I Crazy Cui

446
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,560
will teach you a lesson today

447
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,360
and keep our pride for the Door of Life

448
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,070
take it down

449
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:17,730
take it down

450
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,660
Everyone stops

451
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,200
nobody moves

452
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,420
man to man

453
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,920
keep to ourselves

454
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,610
according to rules of Jianghu

455
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,290
Let's settle it

456
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,460
since I am already here

457
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,160
I represent the police force

458
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,060
Lets cool down

459
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,030
otherwise I have to intervene

460
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,450
how did you find him

461
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,500
I told you

462
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,920
this is what I do

463
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,260
I know he was there

464
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,760
from time to time came up for bites

465
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,670
it is my chance

466
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,170
set up the bait

467
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,990
not for fish

468
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,390
only for a man

469
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,590
The analysis is correct

470
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,449
Dead came to live

471
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,909
and killed the living

472
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,719
dare you not to believe it

473
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,860
here is your proof

474
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,679
Demon Cult

475
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,290
you have to give them the credit

476
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,470
they came for us

477
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,620
because my dad killed them with opium

478
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,010
hundreds of them

479
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,000
In the prison if Supervisor Hu

480
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,680
told you is true

481
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,950
all the dead

482
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,220
belongs to Demon Cult

483
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,770
Sun Laoqi and Feng Erma

484
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,470
are also related to Demon Cult

485
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,580
they came for the Chamber of Commerce

486
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,660
an insect

487
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,190
never seen it before

488
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,890
you father poisoned

489
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,310
and dumped

490
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,240
over a hundred bodies in the river

491
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,250
how are you going to do about it

492
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,900
since we had the crisis at the Chamber of Commerce

493
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,030
I didn't have time to deal with it

494
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,350
kept them at the charity hospital

495
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,130
Let's split

496
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,920
why

497
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,100
insect

498
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,200
insect?

499
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,760
Don't mention about the Charity Hospital

500
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,960
We'll let go of the JuHua Grand Hotel too

501
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,350
but you keep digging up more trouble

502
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,630
and just won't let them go

503
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,140
over a hundred flowing bodies

504
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,770
a secret opium shop

505
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,410
they are big news

506
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,410
why can't I report it

507
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,700
besides

508
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,470
this one is about a great flood

509
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,670
over twenty years ago

510
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,270
why can't I follow it

511
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,640
unless

512
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,040
some one connects the dots

513
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,670
the truth will not come out

514
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,550
Secretary General Xiao sent words

515
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,450
you better leave them alone

516
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,430
if you decided to go down this way

517
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,860
My firm

518
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,500
doesn't have a place for you

519
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,370
I choose the profession

520
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,620
I will respect it

521
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,710
the general public deserves to know

522
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,260
we decided what 's important to know

523
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
certain matter

524
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,950
shall not to be dig up

525
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,480
better to keep it in the dark

526
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,540
I put it in simple words

527
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,510
it could damage your family too

528
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,080
Half of the truth still makes a lie

529
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,700
what is going on

530
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,790
make your point

531
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:41,690
the insect

532
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,300
comes from Sun Laoqi's body

533
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,200
I saw the insect on the flowing body

534
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,020
at the hospital morgue

535
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,250
If Sun Laoqi returned to live and bit people

536
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,810
so can the rest of flowing bodies

537
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,220
insect

538
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,240
don't you afraid the body decomposes

539
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,770
we were going to destroy them

540
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,430
but since we have to take care of uncle Hu

541
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,650
no one minds about the bodies

542
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,830
young master

543
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,380
no more

544
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,400
look here

545
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,390
it is chairman Ding
