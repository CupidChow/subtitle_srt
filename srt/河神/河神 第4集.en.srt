00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,370
Continue the story.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,440
Where we left off:

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,390
Guo and Gu visited the ghost market.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,770
Ding Mao went to the police station to check for missing persons.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,740
Two clues point to one.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,080
Xue Yuanyuan, a young lady from the Xue mansion, had just given birth.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,490
Recently, both Xue and the kid died.

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,080
Guo Deyou swindled Ding Mao,

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,130
on the grounds of condolence to investigate.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,800
Master Xue Qingyang thought that the adulterer came to the house

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,090
and caught Ding Mao.

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,900
Guo and Gu arrived in time.

14
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,540
Xue Qingyang told the previous situation.

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,620
Xue Yuanyuan had an affair with someone and conceived a child.

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,120
Xue Qingyang put her under house arrest.

17
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,150
But Miss Xue ran away with the child

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,670
and fell into the river and drowned.

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,020
Guo Deyou asked the Xue family to bring back the dead baby

20
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,970
and bury the mother and baby together.

21
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
Junior Tientsin Mystic perceived that

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,000
there must be more than that.

23
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,840
This brings:

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,590
Tientsin Mystic's discernment of grievance and criminal suspect to justice.

25
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,900
Men in black stole the coffin and the body.

26
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,280
Guo Deyou explored the Haihe River at night.

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,270
The case of the floating body disturbs Tianjin.

28
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,970
You've been living in the deserted temple for two days.

29
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,100
Are you used to it?

30
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
Yes.

31
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,600
It's a lot more peaceful than the chamber of commerce.

32
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,180
You don't know how to do this,

33
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,620
so stay out of it.

34
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,650
I'll learn.

35
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,150
When I first went abroad,

36
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,520
I could do nothing either.

37
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,490
But the only good thing about me is

38
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,540
curiousness.

39
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,990
Uncle Gui,

40
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,680
do you have a cigarette?

41
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,090
Because just now I held the red umbrella,

42
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,260
in order to let the body not see three light

43
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,159
and gather the soul.

44
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,670
But it was you who carried the coffin.

45
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,950
All this bad luck has come to you.

46
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,030
If you don't mind,

47
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,020
I'll light a cigarette

48
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,530
and smoke it for you.

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Thank you for your kindness.

50
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,300
Thank you.

51
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,550
Thanks.

52
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,250
Do you want to learn lighting-up to analyze grievances?

53
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,390
Of course I do.

54
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,460
But I know that

55
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,840
I just joined the faculty.

56
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,470
I can only learn it after my brother learns.

57
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,430
He won't learn in his life.

58
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,040
Why?

59
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,110
He couldn't touch

60
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,430
anything that had a whiff of irritation.

61
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,300
Not to mention smoking and drinking,

62
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,140
If his clothes aren't washed clean,

63
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,350
they will tickle all over him.

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,300
His condition is called anaphylaxis.

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,140
People choke and cough when they smell smoke.

66
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,460
It's a protective mechanism in the body.

67
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,860
Because of their constitution,

68
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,790
some people are more sensitive

69
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,930
and have a greater reaction to smoke.

70
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,510
Because of the stimulation,

71
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,530
some people even become delirious,

72
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,990
hallucinate, amplify the senses,

73
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,940
and even have a choking reaction,

74
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,270
resulting in death.

75
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,260
Are you not feeling well?

76
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm fine. I'm fine.

77
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,590
Let me show you to the front room for a rest.

78
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,340
Don't bother.

79
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,800
The jade earrings...

80
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,310
Yuanyuan was wearing them

81
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,160
the day she was found.

82
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,080
Young master.

83
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,070
Uncle Hu.

84
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,020
Are you...

85
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,990
What's the matter?

86
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,260
A trivial matter.

87
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,580
The daughter of the secretary general of the municipal government,

88
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,280
Xiao Lanlan, is going to be engaged.

89
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,710
You will attend on behalf of the canal transport Chamber of Commerce.

90
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,850
Don't we have a problem with the Xiao family?

91
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,480
That was a generation ago.

92
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,669
This is the best time to defuse the relationship.

93
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,930
This is a red-letter day for you.

94
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,080
Why do you have time to come to me?

95
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,520
Have some tea, please.

96
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,240
I haven't seen Qian Zixian

97
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,570
for a week.

98
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,130
Miss Xiao,

99
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,150
please think again.

100
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,410
Maybe Childe Qian has been busy with other matters

101
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,400
and forgot about this.

102
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,010
I have a hunch.

103
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,820
He won't show up at the engagement party tonight.

104
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,610
Childe Qian

105
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,670
was usually playful. It's fine.

106
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,820
But how can he...

107
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,880
This is missing,

108
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,110
not playing.

109
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,100
Don't be angry.

110
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,240
Childe Qian

111
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,310
is the best in Tianjin.

112
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,850
And after tonight,

113
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,130
he'll be Secretary General Xiao's son-in-law.

114
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,000
It's normal to go out and relax before getting engaged.

115
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,470
How about this. I'll get a couple of people

116
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,190
to go door to door

117
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,320
to see which venues Childe Qian usually likes to go to.

118
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm sure I'll find out.

119
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,990
When we get him,

120
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,240
we'll give him back to you.

121
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,170
Captain Fu,

122
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,410
people of Qian family are sensitive about their reputation

123
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,530
and can refrain from reporting the case for a few days.

124
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
But I, Xiao Lanlan, don't care.

125
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,990
Since the person has been lost,

126
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,170
there is no fear of shame.

127
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,200
I just want you to be clear about this.

128
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,590
Take it

129
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,490
seriously.

130
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,940
Miss Xiao,

131
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
your engagement party tonight...

132
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,040
As before.

133
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
Vice Mayor Xu.

134
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,950
A set of diamond jewelry.

135
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,990
Colonel Luo of the city defense regiment.

136
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,370
A pair of ivory screens.

137
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,720
Feng shopkeeper of Suxin Fang.

138
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,620
Ten gold bars.

139
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,650
President Sun of the Charity Hall.

140
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,990
An imported car.

141
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,200
It looks like their money grows on trees.

142
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:02,900
Hurry up.

143
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,810
Captain.

144
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,370
What's taking you so long?

145
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,870
Have you gone shopping in Peiping?

146
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,630
I really put my heart into it.

147
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,440
It's cheap and fresh.

148
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,410
And distinctive.

149
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,310
Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

150
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,240
If you take it out,

151
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,620
no matter who is talking about it,

152
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,480
you'll absolutely gain face.

153
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,530
All right, let me take a look at it.

154
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,240
Captain, here you go.

155
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,860
How's that?

156
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,270
You said fresh, didn't you?

157
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,580
They were just out of the water.

158
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,620
How fresh!

159
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,170
One is fatter than the other.

160
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,640
You want me to be the joke of the whole city?

161
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,100
No, Captain.

162
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,520
Let me explain to you, Cap.

163
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,400
I'll kick you to death.

164
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
Captain Fu.

165
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,450
Mr. Xiao.

166
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,160
Here comes Captain Fu.

167
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,980
Inside, please.

168
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,950
Don't bother.

169
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,120
We're still on business over there.

170
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,870
Miss Xiao also asked us

171
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,140
to go and find Childe Qian.

172
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,290
What's this?

173
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,600
It's...

174
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,480
Crabs for gifts.

175
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,540
They're really fat.

176
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,530
Good stuff.

177
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,420
Our Miss Lanlan likes to eat crab cream.

178
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
These were

179
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,530
chosen one by one by our captain.

180
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,200
In Peiping.

181
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,540
Sorry to make you laugh.

182
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,450
It's too shabby to give.

183
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
It's very kind of you.

184
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,350
We're family.

185
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,410
Don't tell anyone about finding Childe Qian.

186
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,960
Otherwise, if the news gets out,

187
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,950
there will be trouble in the market.

188
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,030
Today is Miss Lanlan's red-letter day.

189
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,790
Don't upset the Secretary General's mood.

190
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,630
For sure.

191
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,970
Please rest assured.

192
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,970
No matter how busy you are,

193
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,390
we should be given some face.

194
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,800
Inside, please.

195
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,440
Obedience is better than politeness.

196
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,980
Please.

197
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,110
Where are you going?

198
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,680
Aren't we supposed to go in?

199
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,640
Mr. Xiao just gave orders.

200
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,980
Take care.

201
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,170
Keep watch at the door.

202
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,450
Give me the present.

203
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:10,700
Well, Captain.

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,490
That's it.

205
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,060
Captain, do we still need to find Qian?

206
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,980
Please.

207
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,850
After you.

208
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,900
Captain Fu of Tianjin police station.

209
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,510
A basket of crabs.

210
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,650
Inside, please.

211
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,990
Come on, come on, come on.

212
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,720
You're...

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,870
You don't know me?

214
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,580
Are you on the guest list?

215
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,540
Let me check.

216
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,630
We come here just for dinner and you have to verify our identities?

217
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,620
I'm sorry, it's the rule.

218
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,180
Don't fool me with your son of a bitch.

219
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,190
Mum.

220
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,380
You can go all over the city to inquire about it,

221
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,860
which restaurant does not know me, the fairy grandmother.

222
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,940
Don't make me angry.

223
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,210
If I get angry,

224
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
I'll put a diarrhea spell on you,

225
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,940
putting you out of work.

226
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,800
What are you doing?

227
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,210
We don't have an invitation in hand,

228
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,680
at least we should be dressed properly.

229
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,120
You see what they're wearing.

230
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,250
How can we blend in?

231
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,970
Let's go. I'll get you some wine.

232
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,390
You think I'm freeloading?

233
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,670
I'm trying to help them.

234
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,470
Tell you what.

235
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,270
Heaven, man, god and ghost have their own way.

236
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,600
I got your master a hexagram,

237
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,870
and the message was not very good.

238
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,430
I have come to interpret the hexagram today.

239
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,140
You don't even have that kind of piety.

240
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,250
I'm not cursing you,

241
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,350
your bridegroom is going to have a big trouble.

242
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,550
Do you know that?

243
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,670
Young master Ding, inside, please.

244
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,680
They're with me.

245
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,710
Did you hear that?

246
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,020
Hear that?

247
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,430
Get out of the way.

248
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,740
See you later.

249
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,150
Young master Ding of canal transport chamber of commerce.

250
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,930
500 silver dollars.

251
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,160
He's just a big spender.

252
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,870
Brother!

253
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,920
Calm down.

254
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,980
You promised me the fifty dollars.

255
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,290
You're not going to beat the bill, are you?

256
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,990
I wonder if Agent Ding is free tomorrow morning,

257
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,570
to come with me to the Xue mansion.

258
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,840
Pay the bill tonight,

259
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,980
and the case will be solved tomorrow.

260
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,510
It's time.

261
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,260
Move the coffin to the graveyard.

262
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,450
All three of you, please stay.

263
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,700
You can't go in there.

264
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,080
Guys,

265
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,750
my daughter is going to be buried today.

266
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,990
What do you want?

267
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,250
Don't rush to the burial.

268
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,800
Milord Xue,

269
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,210
there's something you haven't come clean about.

270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,820
Young master Ding.

271
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,640
Although your canal transport chamber of commerce is rich,

272
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,620
you‘re rampant like this without any scruple,

273
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,650
isn't it a bit too much?

274
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,330
Let me ask you: Xue Yuanyuan died in her boudoir,

275
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,740
how would she feel?

276
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,990
Show your respect for the deceased.

277
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,390
Don't talk nonsense here.

278
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,380
In the previous dynasty there was a form of torture.

279
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,970
The waterlogged rice paper

280
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,410
is affixed layer by layer to the prisoner's face,

281
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,580
separately sealed his eyes, nose and mouth,

282
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,880
so that the prisoner can not see or speak,

283
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,360
but can only continue to struggle until death.

284
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,860
Besides,

285
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,950
What a cruel person one would be

286
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,950
to not let go of a woman who had just become a mother.

287
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,569
I... I don't know what you're up to.

288
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,410
But you should know

289
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,890
the consequences of framing the Xue family.

290
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,220
Milord Xue should have known

291
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,290
what would happen if one did that.

292
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,369
Are you crazy?!

293
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,109
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

294
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,240
You tell me,

295
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,970
who's crazy?

296
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,150
You’re talking nonsense.

297
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,440
Somebody, get them out of here.

298
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,280
The weapon used to kill Xue Yuanyuan is in the mansion.

299
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,110
Mr. Xue.

300
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,060
You haven't had time to deal with it, have you?

301
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,230
Although she had repainted her nails,

302
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,620
it was clear that, just before she died,

303
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,850
Xue had hurt her nails by scratching at something hard.

304
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,120
Judging by the extent of the damage,

305
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,270
it's not metal or rock,

306
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,140
most likely wood.

307
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,490
To be precise,

308
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,510
it's varnished mahogany furniture.

309
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,520
Uncle Gui.

310
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,200
In the room where I change my shroud,

311
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,210
you can check there.

312
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,400
When a man is drowned in a river,

313
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,370
his nose and ears

314
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,040
will be more or less filled with mud.

315
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,170
But Miss Xue's body was very clean.

316
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,720
Large families are fastidious.

317
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,230
That's all right.

318
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,010
But in Miss Xue's hair,

319
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,480
I smelt the good Longjing picked before Grain Rain.

320
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,620
And the jade earrings she wore before her death

321
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,760
still had bits of rice paper soaked in tea.

322
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,500
In the river,

323
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,880
how can there be tea and paper?

324
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,290
If you ask me,

325
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,570
Miss Xue must have died

326
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,780
in her boudoir.

327
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,470
The courtyard of the Xue House was built with high walls,

328
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,610
and has men on duty at night.

329
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,000
If the murderer wants to sneak into the house to commit murder,

330
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,560
it's much harder.

331
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,480
But if the killer was from the house,

332
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,870
that would be a different matter.

333
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:00,970
Milord Xue,

334
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,950
what do you think?

335
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,430
If you still don't agree with what I'm saying,

336
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,580
come down to the police station with Agent Ding.

337
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,140
I promise we'll get to the bottom of it.

338
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,310
No matter how,

339
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,320
you shouldn't kill your own daughter.

340
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,930
In distinguished families,

341
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,070
the slightest mistake

342
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,360
may destroy a family.

343
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,790
The daughter of the Xue family

344
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,850
conceived an evil child outside,

345
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,790
which brought disgrace to my family and ruined my reputation.

346
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,180
She should have died outside.

347
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,090
Sit.

348
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,460
You're like this,

349
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,750
and you're running out.

350
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,650
Dad.

351
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,890
I brought you up.

352
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,830
But you're leaving.

353
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,410
You don't want this home anymore?

354
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,800
Listen to me, Dad.

355
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,050
How can you be so shameless?

356
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,950
Dad.

357
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,820
I went to  all this trouble

358
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,120
to keep you hidden,

359
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,030
because I was afraid it would come out.

360
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,200
I wanna cover it up. Cover it up!

361
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,730
But if you run out with the baby,

362
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,830
and someone else sees you,

363
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,940
then my family will be disgraced!

364
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,680
Dad, I'm begging you.

365
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,760
I have to find him.

366
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,180
I beg you to let me go.

367
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,870
Please forget me as your daughter.

368
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,830
Shut up.

369
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,610
You're still looking for the beast, aren't you?

370
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,970
Give me the baby! Give me the baby!

371
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,990
Give me! Dad!

372
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,120
Dad! What do you want?

373
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,170
Dad! What do you want?

374
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,950
Dad!

375
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,090
See if you can still run.

376
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,060
See if you can still run.

377
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,640
It's not gonna work, Dad.

378
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,600
It's not gonna work.

379
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,500
I will go for sure.

380
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,440
See if you can still run!

381
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,470
Uncle Gui! Uncle Gui!

382
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,390
Silence!

383
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,250
Silence!

384
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,490
Even if you don't let me go,

385
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,810
he will come to pick me up.

386
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,580
Are you still going?

387
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,700
Are you still going?

388
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,130
It's not gonna work.

389
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,800
See if you can still run away!

390
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,740
Where's the baby?

391
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,330
He was taken away.

392
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,670
You, you just keep making it up.

393
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,900
Things have come to this.

394
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,910
What's the point of making up?

395
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,990
Let him.

396
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,960
Go, go find him, go, go.

397
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,260
You must get him back!

398
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,260
Yuanyuan was sitting there,

399
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,370
very quiet.

400
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,780
Don't move!

401
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:27,170
Who?

402
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,930
Hand over the baby.

403
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,790
You... Who are you?

404
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,120
As long as you hand over the baby,

405
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,290
no one will know what you have done.

406
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,260
What do you want?

407
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,250
Rest assured.

408
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,350
It has nothing to do with the Xue family.

409
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,050
How can I believe you?

410
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,900
You don't have a choice.

411
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,960
Move.

412
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,400
Do you remember what the man looked like?

413
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,120
His face was covered and I couldn't see it.

414
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,210
Well, you have to remember something about that person, right?

415
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,830
He seems to be a little lame.

416
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,610
Gu Ying.

417
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,540
Catch them!

418
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,440
Got it.

419
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,270
You keep an eye on Xue Qingyang.

420
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,650
What are you gonna do after you have killed a person and hidden the body?

421
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,930
Young master Ding.

422
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,880
Those people are not from the Xue family.

423
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,080
Who are they if they are not from the Xue mansion?

424
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,290
My master was afraid of publicity,

425
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,210
so I hired some porters from the docks.

426
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,840
Not to mention my master,

427
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,200
even I don't know them.

428
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,450
It was the brute who raped, raped Yuanyuan!

429
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,960
Besides his lame,

430
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,670
what other features does he have?

431
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,720
It was so dark. I can't see clearly.

432
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,200
You must have heard his voice.

433
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,530
Is he an acquaintance of yours? Is he a local?

434
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,710
I don't know the accent.

435
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,590
He is not an acquaintance.

436
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,780
I heard him coughing a lot.

437
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,760
Who are you?

438
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,580
Such a narrow road for moving the coffin.

439
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,090
Thank you for your hard work.

440
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,550
Need a hand?

441
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,780
Excuse me.

442
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,750
Excuse me.

443
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,290
Why did he open the coffin?

444
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,100
Run.

445
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,160
You're good at running, aren't you?

446
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,970
You can't run as soon as the sun goes down?

447
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,470
In those days, my second elder brother Guo

448
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,360
was chased by me for a day and a night.

449
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,700
Who sent you here?

450
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,200
Why are you looting the body?

451
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,750
I don't know.

452
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,680
So stubborn, huh?

453
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,710
I...

454
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,230
As robbers, we can only see the money, not the faces of the buyers.

455
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,220
Why don't you ask me about something else?

456
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,090
So where are you going to take the body?

457
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,120
We were only asked to transport it to Yaowa Wharf.

458
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,360
Then someone will take care of it.

459
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,210
Stop.

460
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,660
Now let's welcome Captain Fu of the Jinmen police station

461
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,540
to give a speech.

462
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,340
Applause.

463
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,560
Young master Ding has just joined the police station,

464
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,400
and personally cracked a big case,

465
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,720
and brought Xue Qingyang who was cruel enough to kill his own daughter to justice.

466
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,910
It's really delicaces!

467
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,120
Well, it's delicacy then.

468
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,910
Yeah. Delicacy.

469
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,320
Captain.

470
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,760
You mean affording general satisfaction.

471
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,250
Delicacy means eating.

472
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,940
Yeah, I'm talking about eating.

473
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,220
For the morale of our department,

474
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,530
we need to celebrate.

475
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,500
You have worked hard together with me for so many days

476
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,200
and have settled such a big case.

477
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,860
Of course, we need to have some good food and drink.

478
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,650
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

479
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,370
It shows how much I, the captain,

480
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,860
care about my men.

481
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,760
Yes. Yes. Yes.

482
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,420
We can't close the case now.

483
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,660
How about a sheep's head?

484
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,230
Sheep soup with pancakes, warm our heart and stomach.

485
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,310
You've been getting inflamed recently, cap.

486
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,070
The bodies of Xue Yuanyuan and the baby

487
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,450
are now missing.

488
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Then instant-boiled mutton.

489
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,600
Hand cut lamb of Yongyuande, north of the city,

490
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,340
is particularly smooth and tender.

491
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,050
Mutton gets people inflamed easily.

492
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,270
Better not to have instant-boiled mutton.

493
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,380
We must find out who these people are

494
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,380
and what their purpose is.

495
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,720
Then we'll have fish.

496
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,320
Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish of Shunfu Restaurant.

497
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,360
With shredded tofu and fried pork offal.

498
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,470
I'll heat up a pot of wine for you.

499
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,920
And ask a girl to sing a song.

500
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm short-handed now.

501
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,810
I need extra police.

502
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,080
Give me permission.

503
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,780
Drink little but know much.

504
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,080
A little pot will do.

505
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

506
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,880
What did you say you wanted to eat?

507
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,610
Where are they? Did you catch them?

508
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,870
How can you not even catch up with a coffin?

509
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,260
I did catch up.

510
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,170
It was empty.

511
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,380
One of them jumped into the river

512
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,710
with Xue Yuanyuan's body.

513
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,020
Jumped into the river?

514
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,290
What about the baby? Where's his body?

515
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,850
I didn't see him.

516
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,680
What about the undertakers?

517
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,020
They ran away.

518
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,380
All this time, you haven't caught up with anything?

519
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,690
Go for them if you can.

520
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,870
I should have gone after them then.

521
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,170
You should have stayed with Xue Qingyang.

522
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,080
You...

523
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,460
Who are you blaming?

524
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,190
If it weren't for me and Brother Guo,

525
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,480
you would have been dragged to martyrdom!

526
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,650
I have an idea.

527
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,330
Roast duck!

528
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,490
He's so firm.

529
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,720
Love is so great.

530
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,370
You mean

531
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,500
it was her man who looted the body.

532
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,010
If their feeling is not deep,

533
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,900
this won't worth it.

534
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,670
Didn't I just

535
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,600
hound them to death today?

536
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,880
This is called destroying the corpse and the evidence.

537
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,560
Not die for love.

538
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,090
Do you jump with the body when you dump it?

539
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

540
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,340
Right here.

541
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,750
He jumped off without looking back.

542
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,510
Didn't they rise to the surface?

543
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,470
No.

544
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,320
But it was dark,

545
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,400
so I'm not sure.

546
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,290
Let's go.

547
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,930
And eat something warm.

548
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,200
We're here to investigate a case.

549
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,660
How?

550
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,480
You already said that

551
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,880
the murderer jumped in with the body,

552
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,640
didn't you?

553
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,540
They're all in the water and they haven't surfaced.

554
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,070
Then go into the water and have a check.

555
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,440
That makes sense. Go ahead.

556
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,310
You're from the corpse-retrieval team.

557
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,970
Yeah.

558
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,990
Where's the bodies?

559
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,840
How do you know if you don't go down there?

560
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,280
When you treat people,

561
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,040
you cut them open

562
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,670
before you find out what's wrong with them, right?

563
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,770
I majored in forensic medicine, not Western medicine.

564
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,870
I pulled bodies out of the water,

565
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,020
not wind.

566
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,270
Didn't I give you 50 silver dollars?

567
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,050
That's money for investigating the case, not for fishing bodies out.

568
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,770
How much do you want?

569
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,260
What's the matter?

570
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,990
It's like gambling on stones.

571
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,980
One cut,

572
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,470
and if there's nothing, you'll have to blame nothing but your bad luck.

573
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,190
If there's anything, it's a big case.

574
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,510
Then you'll make contributions, Detective Ding.

575
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,460
Okay. Let's do 50 dollars.

576
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,040
50 dollars is the price for one corpse.

577
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,730
If I had two down here,

578
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,810
I'll charge 100 silver dollars.

579
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,260
Okay.

580
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,660
Xiaoying will bear witness to me.

581
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,430
If there is nothing in the river,

582
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,640
pay me 50 dollars all the same.

583
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,160
Hurry up.

584
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,500
I still don't believe it.

585
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,340
How could he hold his breath in the water for so long?

586
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,889
That's because you can't.

587
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,020
Brother.

588
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,220
You won the bet.
