2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,360
Previously on Tientsin Mystic

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,540
In last series

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,710
Guo, Ding and Gu summarized their clues and made a conclusion

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,990
that if they wanted to eradicate the Demonic Cult

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,590
they should firstly find the Preacher

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,360
and then steal some files from the police office

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,640
At the same time Madman Cui

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,420
went to and made trouble for no reason at the wharf of Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,250
Also he tried to hire the porters here with a higher pay to his wharf

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,260
Xiao Lanlan provided Ding Mao with advices that helped him resolve the crisis

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,060
Wang Meiren visited Captain Fu at the police office

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,520
Guo Deyou took this opportunity

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,930
to steal and copy the files of the Preacher

15
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,560
However the information of the files were encrypted and they can't decode them

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,650
Xiao Lanlan reminded him that

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,170
the original files were needed for decipherment

18
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,480
A mysterious man came to Yishengmen

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,310
and asked Madman Cui for cooperation to destroy Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,790
Before long Huang Yu used tricks of Magic School

21
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,160
and strangled a policeman in the jail

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,230
It was implied in the novel

23
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,090
that Lian Huaqing once visited Huang Yu at night

24
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,070
and advised him on how to take over power of the Magic School

25
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,130
The next day Captain Fu brought Huang Yu to trial

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,010
but Huang Yu was still in disorder

27
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,810
Synopsis of this episode

28
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,390
Guo Deyou sneaked in the consulate

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,269
and Miss Xiao deciphered the code of Xiao Xiguan Prison

30
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,740
Yishengmen and Caoyun Chamber of Commerce competed for business

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,250
The land of the dead has led to great disasters

32
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,520
Come on Let's enjoy it

33
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,910
tomorrow I will make up for Captain Fu

34
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,930
What are these for Junior Tientsin Mystic?

35
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,010
You are so kind

36
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,280
Just because we have a close relationship

37
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,610
I have caused you much trouble

38
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,370
I can't afford any expensive gifts

39
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,290
so I bring  some products of the river

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,160
shrimps and crabs

41
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,960
as a small gift to thank you

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,750
Delicious

43
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,790
Where did you get them Junior Tientsin Mystic

44
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,380
Did you catch them while you retrieved corpse?

45
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,800
As an extraordinary talent

46
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,230
how come I dived into the river and caught crabs in person?

47
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,680
I bought them.

48
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
Those fishmongers usually

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,180
keep some fat shrimps and crabs in stock

50
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,550
not for selling but for enjoying by themselves

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,580
My social status

52
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,850
may be not high

53
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,110
But they don't sell their stores to others

54
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,550
but to me

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,910
they do sell

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,470
In my opinion

57
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,150
you who travel a lot for business make acquaintance with people from all walks of life

58
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,370
and are familiar with jargons and code words in all fields

59
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,630
that we ordinary people don't understand

60
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,650
For example the Spring Ceremony

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,110
uses some strange and complex code words

62
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,170
What is the meaning of them?

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,350
Just preventing others

64
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,200
from knowing what they are saying

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,110
What about the police office?

66
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,190
Are there some  code words

67
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,920
used in the police office?

68
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,050
Oh yes

69
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,070
Our last chief

70
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,700
loved to use something like telegraph codes

71
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,880
and were crazy about them

72
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,600
He even required us to write our leave applications

73
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,800
in Morse code

74
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,960
with the so-called purpose of improving safety awareness

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,130
What's the matter with him?

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,650
In my opinion

77
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,690
this old man was fainthearted and was wary of everyone

78
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,510
But he was too old and became increasingly sluggish

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,600
He always forgot the code of his safe and had to reset it again and again

80
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,640
which caused a lot of troubles to us

81
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,909
and we'd had a hell of a time

82
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,540
This man is interesting

83
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,430
Where is he now?

84
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,380
I forgot to tell you

85
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,810
that the old chief died many years ago

86
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,990
Died?

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,530
His wife buried

88
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,960
his book of code that he studied all his life

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,920
with him in the tomb

90
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,770
and just left

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,930
some encrypted files that almost no one could decioher

92
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,070
in the police office

93
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,570
Those files are almost waste paper occupying limited space

94
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,950
What are the yellow things

95
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,670
that occupy so much space?

96
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,630
Is there no other way?

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,500
We have figured out

98
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,240
the weakest part of each territory of Yishengmen

99
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,710
When necessary

100
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,770
our spies in Yishengmen will cooperate with us

101
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,550
to launch a sudden onslaught on Yishengmen

102
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,360
It was all planned by Supervisor Hu

103
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,440
We meant to

104
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,530
sort all the things out for you

105
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,690
and then handed over the Chamber of Commerce without any trouble left to you

106
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,970
But now you have to cope with the affairs yourself

107
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,090
What about the British Consulate?

108
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,260
All done

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,060
We will act on the day of negotiation

110
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,690
They call it "clean-up"

111
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,810
but actually they want to grab the territory

112
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,220
It's all about an eye for an eye

113
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,990
I don't care what it is about

114
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,350
Just remember that no one gets killed

115
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,490
Don't worry

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,810
Our men taking part in this clean-up are strong and skillful

117
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,280
They will be fine

118
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,930
Not just our men

119
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,750
those of Yishengmen are also included

120
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,690
I don't want to see any one get hurt or killed

121
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,520
My master it's a clean-up so injuries are hard to avoid

122
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,980
Now I'm in charge of the Chamber of Commerce

123
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,120
I won't allow it get involved in

124
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,659
things like fighting with knife and fist

125
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,100
And I want to see the change since this time

126
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,640
Mother have we received the pay?

127
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,580
You shut up please

128
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,470
We are praying for blessing

129
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,920
I rarely see people around us

130
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,760
What if they don't pay us in the end?

131
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,900
You silly girl

132
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,040
Why do you have so many questions?

133
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,330
We should be focused and sincere

134
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,230
I don't think the Yishengmen is sincere

135
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,240
They don't even attend our praying ceremony

136
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,620
You don't know nothing

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,950
The steward explained to me

138
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,540
that they need to take part in a business negotiation in the consulate

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,610
What if

140
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,110
we talk about things while casting spell for blessing?

141
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,110
Will it be more effective?

142
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,990
Mr. Ding

143
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,610
Chairman has prohibited items under his list

144
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,400
What doesn't he want to deliver?

145
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,560
Mr. Ding

146
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,730
Chairman has prohibited items under his list

147
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,250
What doesn't he want to deliver?

148
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,160
Mr. Cui

149
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,510
has manpower

150
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,060
but less ships and ports than Mr. Ding

151
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,970
What do you think about it?

152
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,180
Mr. Cui

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,700
has manpower

154
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,390
but less ships and ports than Mr. Ding

155
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,170
What do you think about it?

156
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,530
Mr. Consul if my ships are not enough

157
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,540
I can buy more at any time

158
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,700
Shipping is the top end of the business chain

159
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,429
We can't do business just relying on the transportation industry

160
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,510
The lower end of the business chain

161
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,620
is the focus of us

162
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,860
such as gambling houses drinking pubs nightclubs

163
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,320
In Tianjin

164
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,180
all types of business that you can name it

165
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,760
have been included in my business list

166
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,890
These are

167
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,400
the sales channels that bring generous profits

168
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,530
We will always be

169
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,870
the first in Tianjin's transportation industry

170
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,740
We have the lowest freight

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,430
the best delivery capacity

172
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,770
and the shortest delivery duration

173
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,410
Also the largest port

174
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,090
belongs to us Caoyun Chamber

175
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,350
The most important is

176
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,210
that the risk of our shipping is the lowest

177
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
We are talking about the issues of transprtation rights

178
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,760
and I believe that Mr. Consul understands

179
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,140
the key point of our talk

180
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,430
What about the tax rate? Mr. Ding What do you think?

181
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,100
What about the tax rate? Mr. Ding What do you think?

182
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,160
As far as I am concerned

183
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,610
2% is acceptable

184
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,080
We only accept 0.2%

185
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,150
It shouldn't be higher

186
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,110
Mr. Ding has no intention

187
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,290
for cooperation

188
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,390
Have you accurately translated my true intention to him?

189
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,740
What's wrong with you?

190
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,370
He wants me to tell you

191
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,840
that the tax rate they offer will never be compromised

192
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,730
What's  happening Young Master?

193
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,010
There is something wrong with the interpreter

194
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,120
Mr. Consul

195
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,380
we Yishengmen has

196
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,040
no such delivery prohibitions

197
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,550
As for tax rate

198
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,380
it's up to you Mr. Consul

199
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,090
In your opinion who are we praying to

200
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,420
people or gods?

201
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,770
The gods

202
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,590
That's correct

203
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,360
We may trick people

204
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,720
but we can never trick gods

205
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,800
I see I see

206
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,290
Do you? You really don't know nothing

207
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,420
Now you trick others

208
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,930
and in the future you may be tricked

209
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
Close both eyes tightly

210
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,540
Mind and behave yourself

211
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,940
Please move down inside

212
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,880
and put them in the back away from light

213
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,040
Silks and satins in them should be kept out of the sun

214
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,980
So I believe we are going to have

215
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,310
a long-term relationship

216
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,370
So I believe

217
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,630
Excuse me Mr. Consul

218
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm not sure if I made myself clear

219
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,280
or this interpreter has got my true meaning

220
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,850
It seems there has some misunderstanding here

221
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,740
Have there?

222
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,030
First

223
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,290
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce doesn't have clear regulations

224
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,610
for prohibited items

225
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,010
so we can still discuss the issue in detail

226
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,590
Second we can increase our tax rate

227
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,310
to 5%

228
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,980
It seemed that Mr. Cui can

229
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,570
easily agreed with the tax rate

230
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,900
which I heavily doubt

231
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,090
A high tax rate may decrease

232
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,070
staff wages and affect ships' daily maintenance

233
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,970
And in the end weaken

234
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,220
our sea transportation

235
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,640
Mr. Consul speaking of sales channels

236
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,380
I want to remind you that

237
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,560
like Yishengmen we also

238
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,550
run gambling house

239
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,830
drinking pubs and nightclubs

240
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,100
all on the larger scales than them

241
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,620
I have been transforming our business

242
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,110
into Chamber of Commerce and reforming our transportation

243
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,480
so I didn't mention this intentionally

244
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,720
What's more

245
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,560
Yishengmen will lose

246
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,370
quite a few stores and warehouses

247
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,040
which I believe you'll soon know

248
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,200
What are you doing?

249
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,060
Mr. Cui

250
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,740
In order to show our sincerity

251
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,170
I will provide the 48 stores

252
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,960
which are all in prime locations

253
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,820
with a three-year free-rent contract for you

254
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,200
This is our plan

255
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,530
This property has been accumulated in difficulty

256
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,290
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce has tried to grab them for many times

257
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,240
My staff have risked

258
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,390
their lives to protect them

259
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,570
Transportation business relys on the nature

260
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,410
and we Chinese people do business emphasizing luck and good will

261
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,460
Over a hundred of lives have been lost at the ports of Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

262
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,750
and zombies bit people there

263
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,580
Cooperating with them

264
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,910
will bring whammy and bad luck

265
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,260
What's more in order to seek

266
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,940
the cooperation with British Consulate

267
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,170
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce should have taken

268
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,780
the despicable measures of looting

269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,330
Mr. Consul

270
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,740
you must be careful

271
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,700
when cooperating with such sanctimonious man

272
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,380
Chairman Ding don't you just inform me that you have transformed the Chamber of Commerce

273
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,780
and refocused

274
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,020
on the transportation?

275
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,920
There may be some misunderstanding here

276
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,010
You don't make friends by lying

277
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,370
So in the next three years the sea right of transportation between Britain and Tianjin

278
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,920
My first choice

279
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,900
will be Mr. Yishengmen

280
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,550
Who's there?

281
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,130
It's Master Guo

282
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,530
You scared me

283
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,430
You have come to me frequently

284
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,260
Am I not welcome here?

285
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,730
You are always welcome and you can even live here

286
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,390
Are you free these days?

287
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,440
I will treat your business just as mine

288
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,640
As long as you tell me

289
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,410
I will make time for you

290
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,170
I do have something that needs your help

291
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,110
Go ahead

292
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,700
Your regular business

293
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,040
Whose grave you want me to rob?

294
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,500
The previous police chief's

295
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,490
Oh his

296
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,200
You know it?

297
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,070
I've met him once in his grave

298
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,090
You have robbed his grave?

299
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,020
Yes I have

300
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,830
But he was too poor

301
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,070
as a police chief

302
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,590
There were few things in his grave

303
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,980
just a stack of books

304
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,610
where

305
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,550
threw out

306
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,020
It is bad luck to keep them

307
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,370
I need to see the books

308
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,270
Why did you throw it out

309
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,090
where

310
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,320
there there there and over there

311
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,360
Have a look at the foot of the table

312
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,300
Guo Ye aren't you looking for a treasure map?

313
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,850
take it easy, my God

314
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,010
sorry, brother

315
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,630
What a nice glass bowl

316
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,130
You broke the entire collection

317
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,030
Put it on my account

318
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,440
I'll pay you next time

319
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,390
Forget it

320
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,680
I don't mind let you know GuoYe

321
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,570
I made a fortune recently

322
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,200
I won't pretend to you

323
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,580
It's quite strange

324
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,440
Someone came to me that day to buy something

325
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,280
No bargain

326
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Guess what

327
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,430
corpse

328
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,480
how do you know

329
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,380
they came to you

330
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,030
just for antiquities

331
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,980
the one got money will go to a jeweler's shop

332
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,980
That's right

333
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,460
but it is not a easy job

334
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,790
Ten bodies at a time

335
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,700
must be just pass away

336
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,860
Isn't it strange

337
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,910
who is the buyer

338
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,050
It's an old lady

339
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,310
She's elegant

340
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,860
She had help

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,680
took the bodies away in wooden boxes

342
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,850
It is very strange

343
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,630
I have to go

344
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,520
Guo Ye you haven't pay me for the book

345
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920

346
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,300

347
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,170
Eat now fresh fried dough twist

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,670
Get to the point

349
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,910
appreciate the efficiency of your profession

350
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,010
take a look

351
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,240
the original manual script

352
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,090
where did you get it

353
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,210
the grave of our last police chief

354
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,190
You want me to turn it inside out

355
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,390
and look for clue

356
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,750
I trust your ability as a reporter

357
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,430
Are you checking up on Demon Cult

358
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,020
Is it the right book?

359
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,140
are you or aren't you

360
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,590
How is it going

361
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,220
Yes yes yes, I am checking up on Demon Cult

362
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,890
just one step away from the truth

363
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,120
without your help

364
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,770
I will walk into a dead end

365
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,950
Alright I will keep the book

366
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,600
If I find something I will let you know

367
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,930
take dough twist with you

368
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,410
They surprised me

369
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,450
Water transport gang suddenly attacked us(Door of Life)

370
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,290
If it wasn't your warning

371
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,970
not only the consulate deal go sour

372
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,230
but also my place in Tientsin

373
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,910
will shake down

374
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,260
sneaky buster

375
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,750
Mr Cui I have another suggestion

376
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,790
would you like to hear it

377
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,960
of course

378
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,870
things come to that

379
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,750
Consolidation is the key

380
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,040
meaning

381
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,870
there are all my saving over the years

382
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,930
take it to the consulate

383
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,260
Let the foreign devils know our sincerity

384
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,950
further more

385
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,970
they will give up on Caoyun Chamber of Commerce completely

386
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:50,930
cool

387
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,480
very cool

388
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,900
Gui Faxiang knows his business

389
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,880
spicy spicy and hot dough twist

390
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,750
what do you say

391
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,830
this is only an ordinary one

392
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,220
they have a super spicy twist

393
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,800
Quit it You can't eat spicy

394
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,420
it is uncomfortable

395
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,000
I accompany you

396
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,430
make up to you for my trouble

397
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,560
you don't say

398
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,750
but Deyou

399
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,220
You have to apologize to me

400
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,530
can't you be serious

401
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,300
fried dough twist

402
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,210
I want a real present

403
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,600
let me ask you this

404
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,160
have you heard of ghost dough twist

405
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,270
what'd hell

406
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,890
It costs a lot of oil to fry dough

407
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,530
and oil priced so high now

408
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
some one has an idea

409
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,720
to find off marketed cheap oil

410
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,360
they dug up just buried bodies

411
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,740
refined oil from the corpse

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,070
cut down costs and taste great

413
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,560
so called ghost dough twist

414
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,940
what

415
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,610
really

416
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,780
of course

417
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,870
I made it up to disgust you

418
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,100
hate you

419
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,320
I don't know about fried twist

420
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,810
but someone did buy bodies

421
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,810
cheat me again

422
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,660
remember the fat guy from the ghost market

423
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,290
he told me

424
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,620
someone brought ten bodies from him

425
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,840
it was taken away in wooden boxes

426
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,060
for real?

427
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,300
fool you know how much a body cost

428
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,250
it won't be worth to fry silver coins

429
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,770
wait

430
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,200

431
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,100
wooden boxes

432
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,760
that day I was practicing at the Door of life

433
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,210
people were coming in with huge wooden boxes

434
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,570
each box is one man tall

435
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,110
there are exactly ten of them

436
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,300
Door of Life

437
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,620
Why do they buy bodies

438
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,160
Raising corpses

439
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,950

there are boxes come in during the day

459
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,510
I don't see it anywhere

460
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,290

461
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,610

464

468
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,630

brother Eel, hairtail says he doesn't know me

488
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,790
The method of virus implantation

489
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,010
should be effective

490
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,380
We have carried out further research

491
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,080
Believe  a vaccine

492
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,580
will be developed soon

493
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,950

495
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,720
In the field of medical and biological research

496
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,280
It's a new breakthrough

497
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,920
thank you for providing sample and information

498
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,540
at least what I can do

499
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,520
as a gesture of thank you

500
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,930

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,540
good news

502
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,660
The German consul appreciated

503
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,370
your effort

504
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,790
I let him know

505
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,010
the negotiation between you and British consul

506
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,140
has some misunderstanding

507
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,870
he already sent some one to smooth over things

508
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,530
it shouldn't be a problem for Chamber of Commerce

509
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,570
to attend the party at the British consulate

510
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,150
You have a chance to talk things over

511
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,830
maybe he will change his mind

512
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,710
really

513
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,730
Thank you so much

514
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,860
hello invitation

515
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,990
go ahead

516
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,610
invitation please

517
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,360
hello invitation please

518
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,610
good, go ahead

519
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,420
hello invitation please

520
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,130
invitation

521
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,140
invitation

522
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,980
sorry

523
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,310
no one allow to enter without invitation

524
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,480
they are special VIP of this consul

525
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,460
truly sorry

526
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,320
go in please

527
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,090
go ahead

528
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,900
what'd hell

529
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,970
The British Consul invited me to perform traditional opera

530
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,950
I hope my luck will hold out

531
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,470
Miss Wang

532
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,930
You must have forgotten to bring the invitation

533
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,200
yes, we are

534
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,240
Master your letter

535
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,470
who sent it

536
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,600
don't know

537
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,380
Is my car ready

538
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,480
It is ready

539
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,300
Let's go

540
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,680
shall I bring this letter

541
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,110
we'll come back for it

542
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,480
looks great

543
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,630
of course

544
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,590
It fits you really well

545
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,040
Miss Gu can keep it

546
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,310
Are you joking

547
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,170
I don't want to be in debt to you

548
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,500
great like a big dog

549
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,160
pike full of dots

550
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,370
you two

551
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,470
grab a drink in the lobby

552
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,780
I am going to the stage

553
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,730
need to get ready

554
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,320
go right ahead

555
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,630
come on

556
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,480
what are you doing

557
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,730
didn't we set the rules

558
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,700
In case if we break up the party

559
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,620
they may get hurt

560
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,970
you shall lock the doors

561
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,980
and keep them inside

562
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,230
why do you knock them out

563
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,220
you didn't explain to me

564
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,520
let's go

565
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,810
don't know why

566
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,790
I feel great

567
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,250
When the time comes, the water of sky and earth will join as one flow

568
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,200
And the eight kinds of winds and eight emotions will combine to break the seal of death

569
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,170
what are you doing

570
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,420
I am taking advantage of the party

571
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,630
One deserves to be starved for missing the free meal

572
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,770
Don't just eat

573
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,700
Take some away

574
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,680
Yummy

575
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,410
Don't eat too much. Find the box first

576
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,510
I...I'm thirsty

577
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,470
It's wasteful not to drink these free liquors

578
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,710
These five groups are all prime numbers

579
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,430
They're positive integers which are not divisible by other numbers

580
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,600
besides one and the number itself

581
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,350
What's the use?

582
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,300
In front of house is broad open space along with trees and hills

583
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,340
Four curved rivers gather here to guard

584
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,790
Strong power falling down to protect this place with so much water

585
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,140
This is an auspicious place with good feng-shui

586
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,190
Cheers

587
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,650
How much have you drunk?

588
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,620
What?

589
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,550
Stop drinking! Don't bring any trouble to me

590
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,630
Are you worried about me?

591
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,040
What?

592
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,520
You want this?

593
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,880
You can say if you want it

594
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,050
I will absolutely give it to you

595
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,820
Please

596
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,130
Why are you so eager

597
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,710
Grouse

598
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,040
You know whiskey as well

599
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,210
When I was in Germany, I used to have a cup or two in the winter

600
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,409
You see in Britain, the royal family

601
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,690
drink a lot of whiskey

602
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,040
to keep them warm in the cold

603
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,130
and to celebrate the hunting the Grouses in Scotland

604
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,430
So you mean

605
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,890
you came all the way to China

606
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,290
for hunting?

607
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,390
I came for business

608
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,650
Cuba Cigar

609
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,620
Scottish whiskey

610
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,010
travel all around the ocean to get here

611
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,360
That's transportation

612
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,100
That's the charm of business

613
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,190
Exactly

614
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,060
Business has made the world smaller

615
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,030
It seems like we are having a much more happier conversation than last time

616
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,420
Honestly

617
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,610
no matter how bad I want this shipping right

618
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,550
The compromise I made last time

619
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,200
is the best we can do

620
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,730
I always have a good impression on Caoyun

621
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,610
Your father is a very respectful businessman

622
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,850
I have been always trying to change shipping business

623
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,590
hoping to make it more standardized and fairer

624
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,510
that it truly work

625
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,480
I remember an old saying in China

626
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,290
if the water is too pure there is no fish

627
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,090
Caoyun you want

628
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,290
may be the water

629
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,250
is too pure

630
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,380
Mr Consul, please speak straight forward

631
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,050
When your father was still alive

632
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,810
we kept good operation in opium trade

633
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,370
It made a rather good profit

634
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,460
If Mr Ding

635
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,920
resumes the cooperation in opium

636
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,190
I will surely reconsider

637
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,450
of the sea transportation right

638
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,100
Why are you here

639
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,290
To look for the big case

640
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,170
Have you seen many big cases?

641
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,670
The Door of Life wants to send them to English Consul

642
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,910
The Door of Life sends to English Consul?

643
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,410
Gu Ying saw that in person

644
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,360
Big wooden cases

645
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,620
are as tall as a man

646
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,050
What''s wrong with this world?

647
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,140
What's the matter with you?

648
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,850
No matter citizens

649
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,940
or officials

650
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,340
All of them

651
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,140
only care about money

652
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,630
In that case is nothing precious

653
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,060
but may be something fatal

654
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,160
Oh no

655
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,150
Zombie

656
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,870
Both English Consul and The Door of Life

657
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,870
have something to do with Demon Sect

658
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,940
I'm not sure

659
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,380
We should find the case first

660
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,900
Such a big thing cannot be hidden here

661
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,320
You can seek it upstair

662
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,650
Such a secret thing

663
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,160
must not be placed in obvious site

664
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,590
You should go to the banquet first

665
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,060
and keep an eye on the Door of Life and those Englishmen

666
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,030
Okay

667
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,140
Wait

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,900
May I ask you a question?

669
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,820
Of course

670
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,340
Could you take a care of this guy for me

671
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,280
Master

672
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,940
and sorceress are so obsessed with liquors

673
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,650
You have seen this happen many times

674
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,360
So you must be more experienced than me in looking after the drunk

675
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,380
You are the specialist of this. I'm afraid I can't help you

676
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,220
Interesting code

677
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,380
Bring him here

678
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,200
Got him

679
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,660
Once you enter here, you can never leave

680
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,620
Ladies and gentlemen

681
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,910
I'm glad to treat you to join us for this special dinner tonght

682
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,230
Representing the English Consul

683
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,380
I wish you to have a pleasant evening

684
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,870
Chairman Ding, how dare you show up here

685
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,790
You can't earn your living on the dock

686
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,840
Now you came here for free meals?

687
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,040
I came here for friends

688
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,280
You have friends here?

689
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,750
Don't you think his hair is so stupid?

690
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,390
Let him stand here

691
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,420
I will go

692
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,780
Thank you so much

693
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,280
Open the mind and let soul return

694
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,880
Lend me some life then buried me later

695
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,990
What...what are you doing?

696
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,830
Dead-reviving sorcery

697
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,870
What?

698
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,850
She set a bone array

699
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,270
She set it with nine corpses

700
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,430
Exchange one life with nine

701
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,480
That's very evil for concerning with monster

702
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,990
It's a great taboo

703
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,510
which will certainly decrease one's life expectancy

704
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,670
If Tianming can call me Mother

705
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,130
I don't mind to shorten my life for a few years

706
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,030
Tianming

707
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,300
the man you mentioned is Hu Tianming,

708
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,860
the Red Badge Guard of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation?

709
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,400
What is Tianming or Tianning?

710
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,220
Who is that?

711
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,760
I guess you are Supervisor Hu's wife

712
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,640
Mrs. Hu, right?

713
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,150
I'm Guo Deyou.

714
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,240
Junior Tientsin Mystic. I get mind of you
