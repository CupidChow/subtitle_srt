1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,290
The story goes on.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,500
In the last chapter,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,730
Ding Mao got well.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,510
Guo Deyou's behavior was abnormal, his whereabouts were also secretive.

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,780
He borrowed money from Ding Mao on the sly

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,790
while Ding Mao was being discharged from the hospital.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,970
Meanwhile, the dockworkers conflicted

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,180
with the film crew.

10
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,900
Guo Deyou went to the dock with Ding Mao to persuade the conflict.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,050
He then met movie star Wang Meiren

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,300
and was invited to attend a publicity dinner.

13
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,260
Guo Deyou went into the ghost market again,

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,680
spending a lot of money to search and buy information about Demonic Cult.

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,940
However, a sudden murder happened just as

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,240
information was coming out.

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,660
The insider was killed by a fly rope.

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,520
The weapon was suspected to be Immortal Rope, a secret skill in gang hood.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,790
Guo Deyou, Ding Mao, Gu Ying and Xiao Lanlan

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,460
dressed up for the film publicity dinner.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,360
The movie star Wang Meiren performed a magic show

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,790
together with the magic master Huang Yisuo.

23
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,530
Guo Deyou appreciated Wang Meiren a lot,

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,640
making Gu Ying unhappy.

25
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,070
Unexpectedly, a murder case broke out.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,320
Huang Yisuo had already been hung on the stage

27
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,140
under the eyes of the public.

28
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,930
Wang Meiren fell into a coma, and the audience scattered.

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,220
Meiren was robbed, and the little witch was also in danger.

30
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,000
To investigate the grievance, the leading roles went to visit Huang's mension.

31
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,520
The second son of the Huang family put an ad on paper to invite Xiong Wan to a battle.

32
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,180
Look after her.

33
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,409
Where are you going?

34
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,430
Gu Ying! Gu Ying! Gu Ying!

35
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,480
Go! Go away!

36
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,830
Quickly! Stop watching! Go away!

37
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,450
Stay in line and go out quickly!

38
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,870
Don't crowd, hurry up!

39
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,440
Stop watching, go away!

40
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,370
Quickly!

41
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,760
Gu Ying!

42
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,570
Gu Ying!

43
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,300
How about her?

44
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,300
She has no obvious wound.

45
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,280
She was not supposed to be knocked off.

46
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480
Can we send her to the hospital?

47
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,409
Wait a minute,

48
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,980
let me try to wake her.

49
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,950
But Gu Ying's physique is not strong enough

50
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,520
to knock her off so easily!

51
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,590
I told you that she had not been knocked off

52
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,100
but was shocked by some terrible thing.

53
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,740
She is braver than a donkey.

54
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,640
A dead person couldn't scare her to such an extent.

55
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,150
Gu Ying!

56
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,480
Captain, where should I put this?

57
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,210
What are you doing?

58
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,550
Stop making noises!

59
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,200
Who told you to cut the rope?

60
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,280
Are you going to hang him there

61
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,610
and let other people have a look?

62
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,490
Do you know that you are destroying the crime scene?

63
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,560
Crime?

64
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,720
It's just a performance accident.

65
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,600
You should think it's an accident!

66
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,530
We sealed off this scene in the first place,

67
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,450
and no suspicious people were found.

68
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,240
The rope which strangled Huang Yisuo

69
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,350
was their own performance prop.

70
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,370
He screwed up the show and killed himself.

71
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,600
That's all that has happened.

72
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,300
The case has been solved!

73
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,530
Did you see that?

74
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,230
Gu Ying has fainted,

75
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,470
but she was at the backstage just now.

76
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,350
That's an obvious doubtful point!

77
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,920
Yes! I saw it! The witch fainted!

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,170
She has offended the seal of death!

79
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,300
I told you so long ago,

80
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,250
Ju Hua Grand Hotel

81
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,110
is haunted!

82
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,000
All right.

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,710
Anyway,

84
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,880
the case is simple and clear.

85
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,920
There is nothing suspicious about it.

86
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,790
Don't make trouble for yourself

87
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,910
and don't bother the police station.

88
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,200
Do you get it?

89
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,280
Be efficient.

90
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,330
Xia Mohai, get this done quickly. Let's go and have some night snacks!

91
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,370
Okay.

92
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,870
Why haven't those onlookers been kicked out?

93
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,520
Go out, out!

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,870
Go, go away!

95
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,290
Get them out of here!

96
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,100
Let, let me go home!

97
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,690
Miss Wang, you can't go out!

98
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,510
You are an important witness!

99
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,310
Let me go. I'll go home!

100
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,170
Miss Wang, you...

101
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,670
Home?

102
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,730
You are still alone even if you go home.

103
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,510
At least there are policemen here.

104
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,590
We will be here with you, too.

105
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,430
Just stay here,

106
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,010
you'll be safer than going back.

107
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,040
This is Hoku point.

108
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,150
It can dredge your meridians and noirish your spleen, it can also eliminate your tension.

109
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,580
You can press it by yourself

110
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,880
when you're free.

111
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,910
In fact, there is another point

112
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,240
that can make you happy in an instant.

113
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,669
Would you like to have a try?

114
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,820
Put your finger on the tip of your nose, like this...

115
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,020
Do you feel happier?

116
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,680
The police will come here in a minute

117
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,510
and they may ask you some questions.

118
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,200
You can just keep silent

119
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,670
if you don't want to answer their questions.

120
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,850
You can tell me whenever

121
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,080
you want.

122
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,130
The only lesson human beings have learned from history

123
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,380
is that they haven't learned any lessons

124
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,550
from history.

125
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,970
People who obey the law and feel depressed everyday, 
 who is of sin enjoy parties every night.

126
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,630
People who prejudice other's interests can buy good horses, 
who are righteous suffer from hunger.

127
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,240
People who donate money to mend bridges and roads become blind, 
who murder and burn have many descendants.

128
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,270
I went to the Western Paradise and asked Buddha,

129
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,620
but he told me:"I have no solutions."

130
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,450
What are you doing?

131
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,540
Isn't she awake?

132
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,970
We don't need to use any other complicated methods.

133
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,570
It's overnight!

134
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,540
What?

135
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,040
You splashed me with overnight tea!

136
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,110
Do you know that

137
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,150
she could have a brain hemorrhage

138
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,380
or a coma caused by brain tissue damage!

139
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,700
You wake her up forcibly

140
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,830
may cause her to turn into a vegetative state!

141
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,500
What, what state...

142
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,870
She may become a paralyzed person and can't take care of herself!

143
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,220
You have to take care of her all her life!

144
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,180
Master Ding,

145
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,160
do you know that you are cursing me?

146
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,980
Did you guys catch that person?

147
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,940
Who?

148
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,430
The man on the stage of Ju Hua Grand Hotel!

149
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,290
Was there anyone else in that place?

150
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,920
I remember when I ran up

151
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,990
I saw a fat man with a bald head.

152
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,800
He dusted me with a handful of aromatic powder

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,080
and then I got out of consciousness.

154
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,620
But I had a vague impression that

155
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,890
the fat bald man left with a suitcase.

156
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,690
But, but we didn't find any other people

157
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,620
when we were surveying the scene.

158
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,960
Didn't you see such a big person?

159
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,620
The fat guy! The fat bald guy!

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,560
We must catch him.

161
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,500
Huang Yisuo's death must have something to do with him.

162
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,900
Miss Gu, you've been in a coma for four hours.

163
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,310
Or do you want to sleep longer?

164
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,480
Of course not! Catch him!

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,470
Please come in!

166
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,440
Please, please.

167
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,220
Put it inside.

168
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,230
Well, this one, place it here.

169
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,070
Welcome! Please come in.

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,840
He had saved so much money

171
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,260
but he didn't wait for the day to enjoy it.

172
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,200
Didn't he?

173
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,070
He went to wine shops and brothels many times.

174
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,030
I'd like to die immediately

175
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,140
if I could live like him.

176
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,410
I think that how much one person should eat and enjoy

177
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,120
in his life

178
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,460
has already been fixed.

179
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
God would definitely take him away

180
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,040
after consuming his due portion.

181
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,760
Don't talk nonsense!

182
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,420
The more people, the more eyes. Beware of eavesdroppers!

183
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,840
He had already gone! What are you afraid of?

184
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,050
Everyone in the Huang family knows it clearly.

185
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,470
Old lady Huang doesn't care about it,

186
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,070
so we don't have to worry about it, either.

187
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,470
What are you doing here, manservant!

188
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,920
Go to work! Hurry up!

189
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,910
Exactly!

190
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,230
Yes, yes. I'll go right now.

191
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,160
Let's go.

192
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,210
You!

193
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,350
Why are you here?

194
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,270
Why do you guys come here?

195
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,400
Why do you come here?

196
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,430
My purpose is the same as yours.

197
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,870
Do you also think that the Huang family is doubtful?

198
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,330
Of course!

199
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
Why are we doubtful?

200
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,980
Maybe we can talk about it.

201
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,560
Yes!

202
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,600
Who, who are you?

203
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,670
Who are you?

204
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,430
I thought there was something wrong with this manservant just now.

205
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,900
What's wrong?

206
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,980
Then I won't talk in a roundabout way.

207
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,160
I am Guo Deyou, the captain of the Wu River corpse retrieval team.

208
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,740
This is Ding Mao, the chairman of the Caoyun Chamber of Commerce.

209
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,500
This is...

210
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
Anyway.

211
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,060
You guys rush into the Huang's mourning hall without permission,

212
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,100
what's your intention?

213
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,880
We suspect Huang Yisuo, the leader of your mansion,

214
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,670
was murdered.

215
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,250
Why does the corpse retrieval team intervene in the work of the police station?

216
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,650
This is Ding Mao, my junior fellow apprentice.

217
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,460
He's a special agent in the police department.

218
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,130
So it may be reasonable for him

219
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,560
to investigate this case.

220
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,750
We think that

221
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,490
there are many doubts about Huang Yisuo's death.

222
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,610
Old Lady Huang, may I ask you that

223
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,490
if Huang Yisuo had any enemies

224
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,120
in the gang hood?

225
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,240
I have long said that big brother shouldn't get pinched!

226
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,870
He must have been framed!

227
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,710
Yu Er.

228
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,970
I want to ask that whether you have found any clues

229
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,530
in my family's mourning hall?

230
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,100
We,

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,500
we just want to see Huang Yisuo's corpse

232
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,180
and verify our previous judgment of the case.

233
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,760
But now our evidence is inadequate,

234
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,410
if there is any appropriate...

235
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,270
Ding Sir,

236
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,890
I understand your meaning.

237
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,390
You mean the police haven't found

238
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,350
any solid evidence at present.

239
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,270
That's why you sneaked into to my house

240
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
to identify corpse

241
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,480
My son had an accident before he learned well

242
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,850
I have nothing to say

243
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,780
But my son's body

244
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,670
I will never let anyone humiliate it

245
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,560
Sirs, please leave

246
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,530
please

247
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,860
Sorry to disturb you

248
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,290
You didn't believe me, did you?

249
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,720
But you still sneaked into the house to identify corpse

250
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,740
And pretended you were the boy arranged for the funeral

251
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,080
With that thievish-looking

252
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,610
Of course you were seen through by them

253
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,060
Well, well. What on earth did you find out?

254
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,380
Is there a problem with the Huang family?

255
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,290
I'm asking you!

256
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,420
Hey!

257
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,760
Why did you investigate the case behind our back?

258
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,540
Do you still need to ask?

259
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,990
You've even had your belly cut open in your investigation

260
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,120
Do you think I'll still carry you with me?

261
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
You such a burden

262
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,250
Guo Deyou!

263
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,550
Watch your language

264
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,700
What are you interrupting for?

265
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,230
You didn't even remember the face of the killer

266
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,370
And you've been knocked out

267
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,400
Didn't you say you were good at martial arts?

268
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,410
You Shendiaoyimen gang

269
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,790
never take others seriously, don't you?

270
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,270
You think I'm in the way, right?

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,040
Yeah

272
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,560
OK. Let's go

273
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,360
You are quite calm

274
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,310
To sit on a high chair

275
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,290
requires patience

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,579
I just want to find the Holy Child quickly

277
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,319
I will try to find a solution for Secretary General Xiao

278
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,740
It might help you find the Preacher in advance

279
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,099
Let's do it all

280
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,690
Remove the obstacles and find the Holy Child

281
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,730
It has to be done simultaneously

282
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,589
I could be exposed at any moment now

283
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,869
Do you know

284
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,819
how much risk I take every day?

285
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,660
Don't you think

286
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,940
The process is more exciting than the result

287
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,350
A process that has a result is exciting

288
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,620
Otherwise it's torture

289
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,190
I'll try my best

290
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,060
to help you find the the Preacher

291
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,380
The Preacher had better have something

292
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,530
and can help you to find the Holy Child

293
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,410
Do you have to describe our relationship

294
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,170
as using each other so shallowly?

295
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,020
Don't you think

296
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,200
you're participating in a perfect process

297
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,890
of biological selection and evolution?

298
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,460
The premise is that I have to be sure

299
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,910
I am in a position

300
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,360
to survive beyond elimination

301
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,550
I hate to deal with boring people

302
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,570
It would be very dangerous

303
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,040
to find you a dull person

304
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,260
This sentence is too long-winded, delete it

305
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,260
OK

306
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,240
As the saying goes, The autumn wind has not yet blow, but the cicadas are already aware of it

307
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,460
The messenger of the death has quietly descended, but people don't know when they will die.

308
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,220
Lan, go on

309
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,350
You go ahead and sort it

310
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,370
I'll catch up with you later

311
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,270
OK

312
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Think of it as an advertisement

313
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,250
Fellow of the rivers and lakes

314
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,600
It's all about licking the blood from the blade

315
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,670
He will definitely come to me

316
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,700
Since you insist on publishing the letter of challenge

317
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,090
in order to force out the murderer

318
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,840
you might as well take a small risk

319
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,260
Please speak frankly, Sir

320
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,840
How about we Tianjin Newspaper

321
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,420
do a column on the matter

322
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,920
If the killer doesn't show up by the deadline

323
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,060
Then Second Young Master Huang will reveal some secrets of rivers and lakes every day

324
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,490
If the murderer is really a man of the river and lake

325
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,260
who licks the blood from the blade

326
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,320
He will definitely come

327
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,720
These are taboos of the rivers and lakes

328
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,220
Sir, if you do this

329
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm afraid you're going to put me on the fire

330
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,800
A famous artist of the Colored Door was murdered and the cause of death was strange

331
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,550
Second Young Master Huang avenges his brother's death in a dignified manner

332
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,740
Rationally, maybe it's a little extreme

333
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,450
But for emotional motives, No one could say a word of disapproval

334
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
What do you think, Mr. Huang?

335
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,350
♫I can't get your love♫

336
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,740
♫Like the air without oxygen♫

337
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,860
♫You are everywhere in my mind♫

338
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,850
I don't know what Mr. Guo likes to eat

339
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,150
Just ordered something

340
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,470
I hope these dishes are to your liking

341
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,320
Good. Looks good

342
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,530
Can you just look at it and be full?

343
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,410
Hello

344
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,940
Are there any chopsticks here?

345
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,170
Excuse me

346
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,990
Can you get me a pair of chopsticks, please?

347
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,960
Don't mind me

348
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,830
Please eat

349
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,640
I have no appetite

350
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,260
Didn't rest well?

351
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,360
I couldn't sleep at all

352
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,510
How about going to another restaurant?

353
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,820
It doesn't matter

354
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,000
At that day

355
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Master Huang was strangled by a rope

356
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,760
and suffocated, right?

357
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,560
Like hanging himself

358
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,130
Why do you ask me this question?

359
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,630
You were there that day, weren't you?

360
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,560
But that's not what I saw

361
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,510
Here are your chopsticks, Miss Wang

362
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,370
Thanks

363
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,730
Thanks

364
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,460
You only saw the head, not the body

365
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,240
Yes, no body

366
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,390
Maybe

367
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,530
It is because you were scared, so

368
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,640
I know what you're going to say

369
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,490
I was sober at the time

370
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,250
I didn't drink before

371
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,950
I was pretty sure, too

372
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,610
It was definitely not a hallucination of shock

373
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,370
I can still sit here

374
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,070
and dare to look at the stage

375
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,270
That means I'm fine

376
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,780
And the image was just too real

377
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,920
It didn't look like a hallucination

378
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,170
I don't know much about foreign magic

379
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,580
But I do know a little bit

380
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,280
about our tricks

381
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,990
Masterly skill is indispensable

382
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,820
In addition to the distraction of the shouting

383
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,400
Of course, there must be items that have been fiddled with

384
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,580
That's basically enough to bluff most people

385
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,780
But if you want to see something new

386
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,670
Then you need some rare things

387
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,940
What?

388
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,980
Sorcery

389
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,140
Sorcery?

390
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,230
Only the sorcery of the Colored Door on the rivers and lakes

391
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,190
can give people a realistic sense of illusion

392
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
Generally, it needs the help of drugs

393
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,830
Miss Wang, the world is chaotic and dangerous

394
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,710
Seeing is not always believing

395
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,150
But when the trick is done

396
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,680
there is no sorcery

397
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,650
Mr. Guo, you mean

398
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,520
When Master Huang was doing tricks

399
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,480
he made sorcery on me

400
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,690
That's what I find strange

401
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,120
What Huang Yisuo performed that day

402
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,940
were just some ordinary western magic

403
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,670
not rare trick of the Colored Door

404
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,880
Professionals could tell that at a glance

405
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,630
No need to use sorcery

406
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,290
for a trick of this level

407
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,660
So I think

408
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,520
Someone else have done it

409
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,220
Who?

410
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,710
The man who killed Huang Yisuo

411
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,420
Master Huang was murdered?

412
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,550
Don't worry, Miss Wang

413
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,160
Leave the matter to me

414
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,630
Nothing will go wrong

415
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,680
Take your time, no one's going to take it from you.

416
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,610
Hello?

417
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,960
What?

418
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,910
OK. I see

419
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,270
Bye

420
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
What's the matter?

421
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,350
Miss Xiao calls to say

422
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,780
Second Young Master Huang published the letter of challenge

423
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,390
He said that if the killer does't show up

424
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,250
he will regularly reveal the secrets of the rivers and lakes

425
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,330
Reveal what?

426
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,620
You tell me first

427
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,780
Like... Some code word

428
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,110
and bandit argot

429
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,920
What a hell!

430
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
There were already people who wanted to do harm to the Huang family

431
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,160
His brother just died

432
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,280
With such a mess

433
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,390
The Huang family is over

434
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,080
Do you think Huang Yu is being used?

435
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,090
Looks like I'll have to go over to the Huangs' house

436
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,670
Master Guo

437
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,300
Freshly fried fried cake

438
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,200
Have one!  it's hot

439
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,650
I just had steak and cod today

440
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,260
I really can't eat any more

441
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,760
Where did you have a rare sumptuous meal?

442
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,280
Why don't you take us?

443
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,320
I think of you when I buy a piece of fried cake

444
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,360
Well, you're heartfelt

445
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,320
It's dessert, then

446
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,090
What do you mean?

447
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,760
Master Huang is in the east wing

448
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,910
Master Guo, please go inside

449
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,590
You again!

450
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,870
Why are you here again?

451
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,390
What did you do?

452
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,570
I almost caught him

453
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,310
The distance between you and him is long

454
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,060
and there is a door between you

455
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,110
How could you catch him?

456
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,360
And your awful kung fu

457
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,670
Who do you want to catch?

458
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,850
Then it's my fault, right?

459
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,890
My fault, then?

460
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,570
Yu, Yu!

461
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,310
Young Master, Young Master!

462
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,220
Yu, what's wrong with you?

463
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,000
Call the doctor! Now!

464
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,370
Quick!

465
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,930
You

466
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,770
Yu!

467
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,520
Oh my...

468
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,590
Mrs. Huang

469
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,730
We can understand that Second Young Master Huang is eager to find the killer

470
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,500
But it is not appropriate to publish the letter of challenge

471
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,840
We were afraid that he might get into trouble

472
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,220
That's why I came here to dissuade him

473
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,710
I never thought we'd run into it.

474
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,100
Don't worry, Mrs. Huang

475
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,280
Nothing serious

476
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,730
It's just bleeding inside the mouth

477
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,480
But

478
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,040
Do you still believe that

479
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,690
your son's death was accidental

480
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,290
Someone has set their sights on the Huang family

481
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,070
The Huang family is in the light and the killer is in the dark

482
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,560
It's very bad to you

483
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,990
So

484
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,120
We want to examine your son's body

485
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,450
We'll find out the murderer as soon as possible

486
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,100
so that the Huang family can have peace

487
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,850
No cuts on the body

488
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,110
No sign of struggle

489
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,520
No injury of external attack

490
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,570
He suffocated to death, indeed

491
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,020
From the mark

492
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,120
The rope should have been tied on by Huang Yisuo himself

493
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,830
How do you know for sure?

494
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,830
If someone else tied it on

495
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,660
The knot would be backwards

496
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,580
If this person is left-handed

497
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,060
The direction of the knot

498
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,800
It's the same as tying himself up

499
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,660
If someone else tied it on

500
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Why there wasn't

501
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,460
any signs of struggle?

502
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,150
That's because he passed out

503
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,250
before he was tied up

504
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,210
I said

505
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,320
There was no sign of an external attack on his body

506
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,750
Have you forgotten how Gu Ying fainted before?

507
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,630
It is entirely possible that Huang Yisuo was drugged

508
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,310
The murderer then tied the knot

509
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,650
Left-handed

510
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,120
So?

511
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,390
I told you before

512
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,560
The man who wounded Yu was a fat man with a bald head

513
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,520
Yes

514
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,550
We all saw it

515
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,820
I saw it with my own eyes at Ju Hua Grand Hotel

516
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,580
You are confused by ecstasy

517
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,460
It's possible

518
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,520
No, definitely

519
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,290
Wu Laoxian

520
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,920
Who?

521
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,330
A disciple under my tutelage

522
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,990
He was expelled from the master

523
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,330
for secretly learning medicine art

524
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,350
Where is he now?

525
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,670
I haven't heard from him since

526
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,450
Yu

527
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,820
What are you doing here?

528
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,910
I heard you are investigating the killer

529
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,720
I'd like to speak to you three alone

530
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,240
After all, I had direct contact with the killer

531
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,630
Maybe it could provide some clues

532
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,230
and help Officer Ding solve the case

533
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,630
That would be great if you could

534
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,950
Please accept Huang Yu's obeisance, my three benefactors

535
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,920
You are too kind, Young Master Huang

536
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,360
You three saved me

537
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,200
and are also willing to stay to help the Huang family thorough investigation of the case

538
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,330
I  appreciate your brotherhood

539
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
It's nothing

540
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,370
We should do that

541
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,280
After all, this is a family affair

542
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,060
Besides, my brother's death was not a glorious one

543
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,740
So I hope that you will not interfere too much in this matter

544
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,860
And my brother's remains are scarcely cold yet

545
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,190
You three just conducted investigation and hunted for theft at his mourning hall,

546
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,810
like nothing happened.

547
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,790
I, Huang Yu, feel really upset.

548
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,620
How about this?

549
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,820
After the seventh week of my brother's death and all the funeral-related affairs are duly handled,

550
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,420
we then find sometime to sit together,

551
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,710
and thoroughly talk about the whole thing.

552
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,580
How about burn an incense stick for him before you leave?

553
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,160
He is dead after all. This will show your respect to him.

554
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,940
Childe, I've heard that you are looking for someone, right?

555
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,920
Yep.

556
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,390
You should let me know that you are looking for someone!

557
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,250
I will ask my guys to find it for you.

558
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,880
Speaking of the person I'm looking for,

559
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,340
we can not act rashly and wake the sleeping wolf.

560
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,270
We should do it through folk ways.

561
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,570
In that way, we should call Junior Tientsin Mystic!

562
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,910
He is full of such information.

563
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,740
Childe

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,580
Should you spend more energy

565
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,810
on our chamber of commerce?

566
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,680
Why on earth when it comes to folk affairs,

567
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,940
I have to come to Guo Deyou?

568
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,750
You mean I can not do anything without him, huh?

569
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,570
It is said that, this guy,

570
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,350
he worked hard when learning skills,

571
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,450
but was evicted from his mentor's for some unknown reasons.

572
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,150
After that he came to suburban area to sell medicine sugar,

573
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,780
and then became kind of weird.

574
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,330
When doing business,

575
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,050
if you never publicize yourself,

576
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,860
how could it possible for the business to flourish?

577
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,140
Not to mention that the medicine sugar he sold,

578
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,440
was quite different from others'.

579
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,700
Different how?

580
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,820
People said that after eating that sugar, they had nightmare at night.

581
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,630
Some kid even got hysteria after eating it.

582
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,610
They just jumped out of the bed and ran all over the places. No one could wake up them.

583
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,870
And after that, what happened?

584
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,060
After that no one had the guts to buy his medicine sugar.

585
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,430
He could not make a living due to that,

586
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,070
so he left suburban area afterwards.

587
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,150
So where is he now?

588
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,460
How could I possibly know that?

589
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,480
But that's why I came here to see you!

590
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,400
I know that.

591
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,040
I would have told you if I knew it.

592
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,670
But I have already paid you!

593
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,550
The person you came here for, is that Wu Laoxian?

594
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,410
Yes.

595
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,440
All the stuff I said before, is that all about Wu Laoxian?

596
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,130
Yes.

597
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,410
So your money is not wasted, right?

598
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,290
As long as you keep sniffing around, you can get everything you want!

599
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,120
I've got it!

600
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,740
This person, Wu Laoxian, he is so weird.

601
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,730
He usually lives in the grassland at the suburban area.

602
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,080
He plants flowers and grasses there, and barely makes appearance  in town.

603
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,120
The question I asked is that where he is,

604
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,670
not what he did for a living.

605
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,820
Why did you say that earlier?

606
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,610
You bastard!

607
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,110
There is a reed land at the upstream of the Yingou River.

608
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,120
My uncle-in-law feeds shrimp there.

609
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,340
He met Wu earlier before.

610
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,020
Wu said he got a land there on his own.

611
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,890
No one knows what he plants.

612
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,760
He is even weirder than before.

613
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,360
But he is still the old same.

614
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,460
So dazzling.

615
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,150
It's hard to forget him after only one glance.

616
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,550
Can I get my money, Mr. Guo?

617
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,750
Ask him!

618
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,110
Stop scaring people by pretending to be ghost soldier!  Your life will be shortened!

619
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,850
You have to be so long-tongued, huh?

620
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,530
Slow down.

621
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,429
This wildness is so hard to walk through.

622
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,820
Your highness,

623
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,440
just leave if you don't want to come.

624
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,460
What are you angry at?

625
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,620
It is none of your business.

626
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,250
Is it because Guo Deyou?

627
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,730
Don't let me beat you!

628
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,010
I can't understand you two.

629
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,950
Is it necessary to keep making your relationship back and forth?

630
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,220
I   think you should really think about it.

631
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,200
How do you think of the relationship between you two?

632
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,530
Because of that actress.

633
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,170
Which actress?

634
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,560
The one who stars in the movie.

635
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,290
Miss Wang, right?

636
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,010
It's about that, huh?

637
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,060
I will not let him get away with it.

638
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,290
You will still help Guo Deyou out eventually.

639
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,930
Ask for help, you shall listen to words.

640
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,710
You stop the silk gag rein and ask for the nation title.

641
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,560
You hold the saddle bridge and ask for the hometown.

642
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,320
Be careful, Xiao Ying.

643
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,080
Don't get me burnt.

644
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,020
Take it easy.

645
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,850
I still count on you to marry me when you grow up.

646
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,060
Get inside. Hurry up!

647
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:13,340
As a fairy, I live neither north nor south,

648
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,470
neither by river nor by moutain.

649
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,570
Should you ask who I am,

650
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,870
I was Ho Hsien-ku who came down to earth.

651
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,160
Help!

652
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,870
My mom is a cheapskate,

653
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,460
but she never owns anyone anything.

654
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,210
Because she said,

655
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,390
you have to pay others double what you owned them.

656
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,480
And I happen to own something to someone.

657
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,870
After then my mother said that person was a human trafficker.

658
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,080
Fortunately Second Brother Guo was there.

659
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,210
However, he started to treat me weirdly afterwards,

660
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,380
as if there are something in between us inside him.

661
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,950
Quilt messy and sheets wrinkled,

662
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,760
showing that Second Childe Huang might be sleeping at that time.

663
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,690
No, resting.

664
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,280
Remember to put down "resting", not "sleeping".

665
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,620
Then the criminal suddenly broke in,

666
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,870
awaking Childe Huang.

667
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,250
They started to fight with each other at this position.

668
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,060
Look at how the table fell.

669
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,840
Top towards outside, legs towards inside.

670
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,530
Obviously,

671
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,810
in order to stop the crimial, Childe Huang

672
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,340
pushed the table down.

673
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,020
We could see that,

674
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,610
the fight was quite fierce.

675
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,860
What a pity!

676
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,990
The crimial was too vicious.

677
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,430
Plus Childe Huang was injured before,

678
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,920
and was not able to use his exquisite kongfu skills,

679
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,650
Therefore Childe Huang was kidnapped by the criminal through this door.

680
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,350
You might ask,

681
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,770
how did the criminal enter into this room?

682
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,520
Did he come in through this door?

683
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,190
The answer is no, not at all!

684
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,440
Look at the door catch here,

685
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,710
intact and in good condition.

686
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,670
This might be time when you feel surprised.

687
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,390
Is it possible,

688
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,380
that Childe Huang,

689
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,350
opened the door on his own?

690
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,320
The criminal and Childe Huang knew each other,

691
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,920
and that's why Childe Huang was less cautious.

692
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,600
Not true either.

693
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,350
The window catch was damaged,

694
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,050
showing that this window was opened outside,

695
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,380
pushed back and broken from the outside,

696
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,190
which means the criminal entered this room through the window.

697
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,130
Childe Huang was awaken,

698
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,130
and they fought against together.

699
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,040
Childe Huang was defeated.

700
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,590
Criminal took Childe Huang from this door

701
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,280
directly.

702
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,620
I rest my case.

703
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,330
Captain,  we did not follow up with you, slow down please.

704
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,370
Listen carefully. I will repeat it.

705
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,380
Not true at all.

706
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,630
Window catch was damaged,

707
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,720
meaning that this window was opened outside,

708
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,140
pushed back and broken from the outside,

709
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,080
which means the criminal broke in this room from this window,

710
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,420
awaking Childe Huang.

711
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,400
They started fighting,

712
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,690
fought against each other.

713
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,280
Childe Huang was defeated,

714
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,540
and was taken by the criminal

715
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,860
from this door.

716
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,620
I rest my case.

717
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,290
Bravo! Good work!

718
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,430
Mrs. Huang, who can imagine that

719
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,540
during such short time,

720
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,460
I am able to

721
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,830
almost figure this case out.

722
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,730
I believe that there won't be long

723
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,960
before I caught the criminal,

724
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,800
and rescue Childe Huang.

725
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,750
Captain Fu,

726
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,130
Detective Ding and Junior Tientsin Mystic have come here before,

727
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,260
and deduced that it is the traitor of our family, Wu Laoxian,

728
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,880
who killed my eldest song at first,

729
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,660
and hurt my youngest song afterwards.

730
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,570
It is definitely him again this time, the person who took my son Yu Er.

731
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,200
Those two bastards!

732
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,330
Right!

733
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,290
As for me, I also had doubts earlier on.

734
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,130
This Wu something Xian was under serious suspicions.

735
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,700
Now is a good timing

736
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,230
for me to take action

737
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,120
of the plan to hunt down this something Laoxian.

738
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,400
You take it easy, Mrs. Huang,

739
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,000
I will find a way to catch this Wu Lao something,

740
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,290
and brought it to justice.

741
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,580
I will come with you.

742
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:19,200
Mrs. Huang, you know, the criminal is vicious.

743
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,670
The gangster ways of Cai Men,

744
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,760
may be unfamiliar to you, Captain Fu.

745
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,560
This Wu Laoxian was once a protege of our family.

746
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,490
I can not stand here and watch him

747
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,880
ruining two of my sons.
