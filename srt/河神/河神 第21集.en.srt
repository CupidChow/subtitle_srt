1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,390
Continue to say based on the last time.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,590
Last time the book said,

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,620
Captain Fu and Yu Si,

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,690
Came forward to suppress the riots.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,630
Guo Deyou risked his death

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,880
to save the hypnotized A Shuang.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,140
Huang Yu took Guo Deyou hostage.

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,720
Captain Fu shot Topaz to death.

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,920
Suddenly an army arrived.

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,760
Took over control of the prison.

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,640
Xiao San told Secretary General Xiao,

13
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,400
Little Immortal was already died and buried.

14
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,770
Wang Meiren farewelled and met Gu Ying by chance,

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,950
then two people compromised with each other.

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,550
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao learned from Captain Fu,

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,570
the preacher has been executed.

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,370
Xiao San comforts Xiao Lanlan,

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,270
and say do not go deep into the Demon Sect.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,260
Xiao San and Lian Huaqing

21
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,480
turned against with each other.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,200
But dominated by Lian Huaqing instead.

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,480
While Gu Ying and Guo Deyou

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,710
were full of tender affection,

25
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,240
they were bumped into by Master Zhang.

26
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,430
In verbal confrontation,

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:50,610
Master Zhang learned

28
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,020
that the Little Immortal was born.

29
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,970
She was terrified.

30
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,770
Xiao Lanlan's father warns Ding Mao

31
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,390
that don't have anything to do with Xiao Lanlan.

32
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,880
At this time Ding Mao knew,

33
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,100
the army that took over the prison

34
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,360
was sent by the Xiao's family.

35
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,920
In summary,

36
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,810
Ding Mao was attacked, Xiao San was defeated,

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,170
Gu Ying was in distress again,

38
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,740
Lian Huaqing's conspiracy proceeded secretly,

39
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,860
and then finally met the Little Immortal.

40
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,470
After Tianming is passed away,

41
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,310
Aunt Hu has no hope in her heart,

42
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,800
so that Demon Sect

43
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,710
took advantage of this loophole.

44
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,850
Uncle Hu,

45
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,090
I'm sorry for your loss.

46
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,870
God send it may be so!

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,070
It can be regarded as retribution!

48
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,130
Do not worry.

49
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,400
I have sent someone to arrange the funeral.

50
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,380
Thank you, childe.

51
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,450
What happened then?

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,760
Later,

53
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,880
They control the Huang Yu of The Colored Door.

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,250
They want to use his kung fu.

55
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,050
To do a jail delivery in Xiao Xiguan Prison.

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,460
Jail delivery?

57
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,230
He is going to save the veteran of Demon Sect.

58
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,990
The Little Immortal.

59
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,150
Has he come out yet?

60
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,210
He has been executed.

61
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,740
Executed?

62
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,590
He was executed by the temporary army.

63
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,800
Didn't I tell you before?

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,450
He could easily

65
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,020
let us hundreds of officers

66
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,490
and soldiers kill each other.

67
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,680
We had sacrificed hundreds of lives,

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,220
just barely caught him.

69
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,690
Are you sure

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,230
that he is really dead now?

71
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,940
Do you know there is anyone

72
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,300
who has experienced those things

73
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,080
and is easy to deal with

74
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,630
or we can find them?

75
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,030
What kind of wine it is?

76
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,010
Lao Tai Bai. (a kind of white wine)

77
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,750
What I am asking is what kind of wine it is?

78
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,900
Mother, what's wrong?

79
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,640
Go away.

80
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,820
Boy!

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,860
Since ancient times,

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,090
When there is a wedding,

83
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,910
we are going to have a wedding feast.

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,610
When there is a funeral,

85
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,990
we are going to have a funeral feast.

86
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,100
When we are tired,

87
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,570
we are going to have refreshing wine.

88
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,330
When we are worried,

89
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,440
we are going to have outlet wine.

90
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,690
There must be a saying for a toast.

91
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,540
What kind of wine is this?

92
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,980
I never drink confused wine.

93
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,230
When wine comes into the throat,

94
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,560
it is in the heart.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,280
Female Immortal,

96
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,650
I will use tea instead of wine to toast you.

97
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,990
Forget it.

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
You are cunning persons.

99
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,060
I know it.

100
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,940
Donâ€™t you just want to get me drunk?

101
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,180
How could it be?

102
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,280
We are not the person you think.

103
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,670
Then say it.

104
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,930
We just want to ask you something, actually.

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,620
The wine of asking a way.

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,380
Yes, the wine of asking the way.

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,010
Yes, yes, yes.

108
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,690
What way?

109
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,980
Nothing important.

110
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,320
We just want to find out

111
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,310
that when you were young,

112
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,870
Your real mien and great deeds.

113
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,950
Really?

114
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,750
Really.

115
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,200
Good wine.

116
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,370
Change it into bowl.

117
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,350
Great, let's change it into bowl.

118
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,060
Fill the cup.

119
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,120
Okay.

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,600
You can say it now.

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,650
We'll just say it directly.

122
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,480
We are here

123
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,750
for the Little Immortal of Demon Sect.

124
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,650
Drinking all the wine without giving us directions.

125
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,030
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

126
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,440
Then I'll pay you back the wine.

127
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,050
The 30-year old Lao Tai Bai.

128
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,330
What's the price of this wine,

129
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,300
you should know better than me.

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,290
Just these few poor dishes,

131
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,520
you still want to ask for directions...

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,680
Order anything as you want.

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,180
A pound of good joint.

134
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,710
Replete.

135
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,570
Lead us the direction.

136
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,400
Bartender, order!

137
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,130
As I told you just now,

138
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,230
all the blood brothers are dead.

139
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,720
Are you particularly wondering

140
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,040
that Chief Ding and your master

141
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,500
they are all people

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,350
who lick blood on the knife head.

143
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,140
People would rather not have their own lives,

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
to wipe out Demon Sect.

145
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
But why until now,

146
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,310
they are still doing their own business

147
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,030
for a living?

148
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,520
There is no official statement.

149
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,890
It's all due to the current city government

150
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,500
Secretary General Xiao,

151
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,669
Xiao Lanlan's father.

152
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,690
That's right.

153
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,490
Do you know

154
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,450
how he became the Secretary General?

155
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,400
Back thenï¼Œ

156
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,140
The one who took the lead in doing this

157
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,480
is his surname Xiaoã€‚

158
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,070
You know, suppress the Demon Sect.

159
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,720
What a contribution it was at the time!

160
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,560
But the Xiao was too selfish.

161
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,450
He took all the credit

162
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,290
for such a big job on himself.

163
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Your father was angry,

164
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,450
Have good official business

165
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:16,930
and don't keep on doing it.

166
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,900
Start his own business.

167
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,320
So that,

168
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,510
Chief Ding became Chairman Ding,

169
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,490
Then Deputy Chief Hu has become Chief Hu.

170
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,100
And your master.

171
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,670
was originally a gangster,

172
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,380
go back to where he comes from.

173
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,640
Got kicked and then finished.

174
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,720
From that time,

175
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,470
That water transport of grain to the capital

176
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,280
and Xiao family has been in a bad relationship.

177
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,230
If this preacher is really so evil,

178
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,890
the riot at Xiao Xiguan Prison,

179
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,380
it should be Demon Sect rushing to him.

180
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
So Xiao Lanlan's father

181
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,340
in order not to be involved,

182
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,880
the army was sent to suppress Xiao Xiguan Prison.

183
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,760
Execution of the Little Immortal,

184
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,250
forever no future troubles.

185
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,380
Then why didn't he do it early?

186
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,100
When Demon Sect was eliminated,

187
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,930
why didn't he wipe out the Little Immortal together?

188
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,210
wipe out the Little Immortal together?

189
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,870
Arrested and locked up in jail,

190
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,350
even held in secret for twenty years.

191
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,400
Now executed him again,

192
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,260
why?

193
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,030
Kill me with one shot, how long will you live?

194
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,760
It's impossible to kill the Little Immortal

195
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,970
with a few shots.

196
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,330
The real truth is embarrassing.

197
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,060
Don't make me spend too much effort

198
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,940
to understand the truth.

199
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,790
Lian Huaqing.

200
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
You lose.

201
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,130
Winning or losing is a process

202
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,470
that evolution must go through.

203
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,040
You are impatient.

204
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,400
I can't trust you.

205
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,560
There is no way to cooperate with you.

206
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,920
There are two possibilities

207
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,630
for negotiating parties to reach a consensus.

208
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,670
The first is not to owe each other,

209
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,970
and the second

210
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,760
is that the two sides

211
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,220
have grasped the other side's handle.

212
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,530
We belong to the second.

213
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,340
You put a bug on me.

214
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,290
The Little Immortal didn't die.

215
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,470
You know where he is.

216
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,520
Consensus reached.

217
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,850
Stupid, too stupid!

218
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,060
I have never thought so eagerly

219
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,100
that you urgently need to evolve.

220
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,460
Get rid of the bugs from me,

221
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,400
Otherwise you will never see Little Immortal,

222
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,070
and you will never find the Holy Child.

223
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,780
Demon Sect is over.

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,530
Misunderstanding of truth

225
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,720
will not destroy the truth.

226
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,140
Low-level neglect of evolution

227
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,000
will not hinder the formation of evolution.

228
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,810
The news of the Little Immortal

229
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,270
is hidden tightly.

230
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,320
Like these tempests,

231
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,150
it's all because of finding him out,

232
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,230
then it calmed down in an instant.

233
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,670
Just like when we didnâ€™t know this person

234
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,420
at all before.

235
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,830
But the witch said so much

236
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,010
and it further confirmed one thing

237
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,560
that the Xiao family had a problem.

238
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,980
How do we check next?

239
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,190
Rely on you!

240
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,750
Start with Xiao Lanlan.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,940
Her father doesn't want me to see her again.

242
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,350
Do officials treat the savior like this?

243
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,920
I also find it weird.

244
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm afraid Huang Yu is just a pawn.

245
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,600
Xiao family is the rook of Demon Sect.

246
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,090
If so,

247
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,550
The relationship between you and Miss Xiao...

248
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,310
No way, I will check it out.

249
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,690
Then go.

250
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,230
The reason why I told you all

251
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,200
about the Little Immortal.

252
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,660
Just to make you totally give up.

253
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,570
Stop here.

254
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,740
From now on,

255
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,740
Never have anything to do with Demon Sect.

256
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,010
And the jinx Guo Deyou,

257
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,190
don't fool around with him.

258
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,340
Including Ding Mao.

259
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,400
Mother, do you have to put it like this?

260
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,850
Do you think I dare?

261
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,330
Don't test me,

262
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,850
I can do anything, 
even though you are my daughter.

263
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,320
You are not allowed to go out

264
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,380
after sunset!

265
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,430
But the sun hasn't set yet!

266
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,760
So you have to monkey around, huh?

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,180
Try it if you don't believe,

268
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,000
let's see if you can get out from here.

269
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,130
Ma, you just won't allow me to...

270
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,360
to go outside, will you?

271
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,130
Yes,

272
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,560
even if you will hate me from now on.

273
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,230
All right then,

274
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,660
I'll go anyway, please don't hate me...

275
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,420
You...you...

276
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,160
dare you come back and have another battle?

277
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,560
Tell me,

278
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,040
what is there to see about this riverï¼Ÿ

279
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,050
When I was a little kid,

280
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,340
My father would bring me here,

281
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,770
He always kept standing here,

282
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,110
staring at this river

283
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,850
without saying anything.

284
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,310
I couldn't understand it back then,

285
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,970
What about now?

286
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,350
Now, when I think about it,

287
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,840
if there is something unpleasant in my mind,

288
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,390
I do feel better

289
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,930
when I look at the river.

290
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,400
Why didn't I get

291
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,700
better yet?

292
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,480
The prisoner in Xiao Xiguan Prison,

293
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,500
is it wrong that we killed him?

294
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,830
If you didn't kill him,

295
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,060
he would took our lives.

296
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,290
This is justifiable defense.

297
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,280
Look, it is still shaky.

298
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,730
It's just the reflexes of the body,

299
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,750
should fade in a day or so.

300
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,780
What did my father tell you?

301
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,130
Nothing serious, just something about the family.

302
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,860
Did he give you a hard time?

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,740
Certainly not.

304
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,430
There are a lot of things that

305
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,619
your father refused to tell you, are there?

306
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,369
Your father has also hidden many thing from you!

307
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,800
That's true.

308
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,680
the Chamber of Commerce for 
Grain Transportation isn't entire clean.

309
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,030
A cult has been working against us,

310
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,119
and now the Yi ShengMen Gang is making troubles,

311
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,270
our business with the 
 British didn't work out either.

312
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,300
I wasn't obedient throughout

313
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,690
my past years,

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,740
People always tell me that

315
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,340
I need to see the big picture and do things correctly,

316
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,450
but, I will never give up

317
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,980
in fighting this Demon Sect.

318
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,180
So, there is something I'd like to ask you.

319
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,230
The Demon Sect and the Secretary General Xiao...

320
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,140
Thank you!

321
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,040
For what?

322
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,640
Thank you for being here.

323
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,520
Your presence made me realized that

324
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,170
people like me do not have to resign
 ourselves to destiny,

325
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,830
I realized that with myself alone, 
 I could go to the

326
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,480
temple and find a master for myself.

327
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,470
I could go the police station

328
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,740
and investigate the case like a detective.

329
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,440
I could reveal

330
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,490
the secret cult with all my might,

331
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,140
If you could do this,

332
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,940
so could I.

333
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,590
That's why I need to thank you.

334
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,190
I'm flattered.

335
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,000
Actually I wanted to ask you...

336
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,860
I mean, the Demon Sect and your family...

337
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,840
You are...?

338
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,590
What are you doing?

339
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,900
Let go of me!

340
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,060
Let her go!

341
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,060
Take him back.

342
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,080
Move!

343
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,160
Are you alright?

344
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,470
Go back early.

345
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,190
Who is that?

346
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,590
I'll take care of this.

347
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,710
You don't have to worry about this
  matter, Chairman Ding.

348
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,070
Are you insane?

349
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,180
Didn't I locked the door?

350
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,570
How did you get in?

351
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,800
How could your wall

352
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,730
keep me outside? I'm the fairy!

353
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,710
Do you know what time is it now?

354
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,290
Do you think I need to consider 
 the time before I come to find you?

355
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,960
Are your pants clean? They might dirty my bed!

356
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,520
Just say it if you want to say anything,

357
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,460
I was about to sleep,

358
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,750
and don't expect that I'll send you back home.

359
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,270
If it is that inconvenient,

360
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,940
I won't go back home then.

361
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,630
You won't go back?

362
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,670
Is it not convenient for you?

363
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,530
Do you think this is convenient for you?

364
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,260
Yeah?

365
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:05,990
I'm afraid...

366
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:06,750
What?

367
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,700
that your mother will kill me.

368
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,810
Oh, the "fantastic genius"

369
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,170
are feeling shy!

370
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:13,960
Wrong,

371
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,710
I'm the extraordinarily fantastic genius!

372
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,080
Besides,

373
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,290
it's only you and me here, a man and a woman,

374
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,220
that's inappropriate.

375
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,000
Why is it inappropriate?

376
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,950
It's only you and me,

377
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,690
what can you do?

378
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,780
What can I do?

379
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,450
You know it.

380
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,390
Fine,

381
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,210
in this case,

382
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,620
I, the fantastic genius,

383
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,100
will show you how "extraordinary" I am.

384
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,030
I'm just kidding!

385
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,050
You argued with your mother again?

386
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,340
Fine,

387
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,980
You can sleep here,

388
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,260
and I'll go to the room of Ding Mao.

389
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,840
But I have to tell you this,

390
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,760
if your mother come here and yell hysterically

391
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,700
like a manic,

392
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,610
I will not help you to solve it.

393
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,210
"Fantastic genius"!

394
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,590
I..

395
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,050
I'll just leave then.

396
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,430
Go to bed early.

397
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,740
Ding Mao,

398
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,430
Be careful.

399
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,750
We still have no idea about what are these people up to.

400
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,210
We don't have to worry as long as
 you arrived at home safely.

401
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,960
It seems that this is the first time you call me Ding Mao.

402
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,020
Is that so, Chairman Ding?

403
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,370
Yes,

404
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,310
Miss Xiao.

405
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,930
Good night, Ding Mao.

406
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,480
Good night,

407
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,310
Lan lan.

408
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,710
Who is it?

409
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,330
It's me!

410
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,890
You?

411
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,550
What are you doing?

412
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,580
I...I came back to look for my stuff!

413
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,240
Why didn't you even say anything?

414
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,920
I thought you were a thief!

415
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,750
Why should I tell you when
 I come back to my room?

416
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,540
Why are you in my room?

417
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,190
Gu Ying will sleep in my room.

418
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,420
She moved here?

419
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,500
In your dreams!

420
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,440
You scared me! It's so late at night.

421
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,040
Oh, you think it's late at night?

422
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,930
Can't you just wait until tomorrow?

423
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,120
How can I fall asleep now?
 It's a serious matter.

424
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,190
The Xiao's Family is really suspicious.

425
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,690
I remember that I have some documents 
 from the government of Tianjin

426
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,610
and the record of administrative 
 deployment of the armies,

427
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,600
I got to take a look.

428
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,500
I told you that the 
 Xiao's family is very suspicious,

429
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,780
and you still haven't got any clue yet?

430
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,670
I told you to make some breakthrough
 by talking with Xiao Lanlan,

431
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,140
Did you do this? Did you get any breakthrough?

432
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,020
How do you know I didn't?

433
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,480
Listen,

434
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,190
tonight,

435
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,930
someone has almost

436
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,310
killed Xiao Lanlan and me.

437
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,560
The Demon Sect?

438
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,680
Anyway, he's after Xiao Lanlan.

439
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,010
Did you guys get hurt?

440
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,110
That Xiao San suddenly appeared

441
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,330
and saved us.

442
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,640
See?

443
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,070
His father used all the means to 
 prevent you meeting her,

444
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,430
He must have sent guards to spy on you.

445
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,260
If they see you do anything,

446
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,730
they will just go and get you.

447
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,840
This is where I suspect.

448
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,210
I met Xiao Lanlan secretly

449
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,900
because I want to ask her the relationship 
between the Demon Sect and the Xiao's family.

450
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,430
But before I could utter those words,

451
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,780
That Xiao San, he just appeared

452
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,610
like he has planned everything.

453
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,470
The Xiao's family took so 
 much precaution against us,

454
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,720
the truth must be near.

455
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,950
By the way,

456
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,100
will our investigation against the Demon Sect delay

457
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,460
your marriage, the final settlement in life?

458
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,380
Miss Xiao and Chairman Ding,

459
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,900
You two match each other in social status.

460
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,990
Can't you just say something that really matters?

461
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:23,980
OK,

462
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,140
SOMETHING THAT REALLY MATTERS.

463
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,250
Take your time and continue to investigate,

464
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,220
I'll sleep in Master's room.

465
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,580
Farewell and take care.

466
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,900
I had to change the bed 
 I sleep on for three times tonight,

467
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,040
Whose house is it exactly?

468
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,360
When you get back, tell Lian Huaqing that

469
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,480
from now on,

470
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,080
the Demon Sect will make itself 
 the adversary of the entire Tianjing City.

471
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,250
Don't you know how the Demon Sect

472
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,920
get things done?

473
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,360
If our real target is Xiao Lanlan,

474
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,090
Do you think you can still 
 stop us so easily like this?

475
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,960
Now,  you are here,

476
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,330
who can protect the Little Immortal this time?

477
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,550
That's impossible!

478
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,840
There is no way you could know where 
 is the Little Immortal!

479
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,660
Of course I don't know,

480
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,880
but I'm sure Lian Huaqing knows.

481
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:45,840
You are lying!

482
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,970
Go and check it yourself, 
 you'll know it soon enough.

483
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,240
Let's go!

484
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,450
Hello boy.

485
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,750
Secretary General, Xiao Xiguan Prison...

486
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,780
How did the riot broke out?

487
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,550
As to the follow-ups,

488
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,870
you're the one who's in charge of that, right?

489
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,560
The reason I asked you to come here

490
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,190
is to know the details.

491
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,320
I suppose Xiao San Ye has took charge of it.

492
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,250
Xiao San?

493
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,800
He came with the command you signed off on

494
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,640
and took over the case.

495
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,900
All the urgent confidential tasks

496
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,460
will be secretly handled by him.

497
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,510
Were the criminals shot?

498
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,150
Shot?

499
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,540
Wasn't your command to assign all the special criminals

500
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,600
and follow-ups to Xiao San?

501
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,920
That means

502
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,670
you have no idea of what happened next, right?

503
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,970
Search for Xiao San in the whole city.

504
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,270
Yes, Sir.

505
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,770
Nice place.

506
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,770
Quiet.

507
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,270
May I drink?

508
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,330
Sure.

509
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,870
Is it the way you treat a guest?

510
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,410
Never fill the teacup to the brim for your guests.

511
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,240
Take the tea as wine.

512
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,460
Don't you think

513
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,570
being able to forecast the future

514
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,860
is very important?

515
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,740
Of course.

516
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,730
Caring about tomorrow is caring about evolution.

517
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,580
But the cycle of evolution is fixed.

518
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,220
If you try to speed it up,

519
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,980
then in the future

520
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,310
things might not happen as it's supposed to.

521
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,770
The future of Demon Sect

522
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,970
is in the room.

523
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,500
As long as I find the Holy Child,

524
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,020
Demon Sect will evolve.

525
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,430
But time to me

526
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,130
is like a luxury.

527
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,190
You are the Preacher.

528
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,380
You should tell me where the Holy Child is.

529
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,810
You're not my boss.

530
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,000
We don't need to collaborate either.

531
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,530
We are only

532
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,210
two people who have the same goal.

533
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,820
I'm the Preacher.

534
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,710
I'll find the Holy Child.

535
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,120
Don't you forget.

536
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,810
I'm the one who set you free.

537
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,590
Once I find the Holy Child,

538
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,310
I'll bring him to you.

539
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,680
As to the development of Demon Sect,

540
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,800
it's up to you.

541
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,480
Got up early, huh?

542
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,740
I didn't sleep at all.

543
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,970
I saw a book about hypnosis.

544
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,150
It reminded me of the Little Immortal, so I started reading it.

545
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,930
Hypnosis?

546
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,100
Yes.

547
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,250
The key to breaking hypnosis

548
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,860
is to not focus.

549
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,380
Don't think about anything.

550
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,370
Don't pay attention to anything.

551
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,200
Sounds fit for me.

552
00:33:59,170 --> 00:33:59,880
Just mind wandering.

553
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,090
But to keep this state

554
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,550
is really difficult.

555
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,620
As to the person who hypnotises you,

556
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,580
everything he says,

557
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,420
you'd like to ask a why.

558
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:17,449
Keep your mind on your own thing

559
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,350
so that you could distract your attention.

560
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,260
As for the documents of the Xiaos,

561
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,360
there's nothing special

562
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,610
except for the identification of Xiao San.

563
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,260
He was not born in the family,

564
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,770
and started to work for Secretary General Xiao ten years ago.

565
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,610
There was no record before that.

566
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,920
So I'm thinking...

567
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,630
Stop.

568
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,370
Keep it to yourself.

569
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,850
No need to tell me.

570
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,030
I haven't had my breakfast.

571
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,570
You almost made my head swim.

572
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,320
What do you want for breakfast?

573
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,219
Nothing. Have it for you and Gu Ying.

574
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,750
Don't you want to treat me with the breakfast?

575
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,690
I have to look for other materials.

576
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,159
And there's an experiment about breaking hypnosis.

577
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,170
I've gotta try it out.

578
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,830
Get up.

579
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,840
Time to grab some breakfast.

580
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm coming in.

581
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,660
Put on your trousers.

582
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,680
You saw the ocean.

583
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,230
The water is shining.

584
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,960
The birds are circling.

585
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,900
The water keeps shining.

586
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,240
The birds keep circling.

587
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,510
One bird. Once circle.

588
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,530
Two birds. Two circles.

589
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:20,000
Three birds. Three circles.

590
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,710
Four birds. Four limb weakness.

591
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,080
Five birds.

592
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,730
Five...

593
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Come.

594
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,950
Ding Mao.

595
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,460
Ding Mao.

596
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,050
Ding Mao.

597
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,350
Ding Mao.

598
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,420
Ding Mao.

599
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
Chairman Ding.

600
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,020
Chairman Ding.

601
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,940
Chairman Ding.

602
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,730
Miss... Miss Xiao.

603
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,010
I'm sorry for disturbing your rest.

604
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,370
It's okay.

605
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,200
I was studying hypnosis,

606
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,420
and happened to hypnotise myself.

607
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,840
The Little Immortal could be alive.

608
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,460
How do you know?

609
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,500
My dad assigned the corps to the Xiao Xiguan Prison

610
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,250
to shoot the Little Immortal,

611
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,090
but Xiao San faked my dad's command

612
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,320
and took him away.
