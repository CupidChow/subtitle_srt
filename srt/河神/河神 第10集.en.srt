1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,310
Story goes on. In the last episode it was said that

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,510
Supervisor Hu was put in prison

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,550
His wife was lonely and helpless

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,110
Ding Mao was moved and comforted her

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,430
The body of Feng Erma from Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,070
was found on the dock at Yishengmen

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,350
Unable to reconcile, the two sides agreed to argue by reasoning

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,630
Feng Erma's body was buried back to the Dragon King Temple

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,870
Xiaohai, the family of the victim lived in the temple too

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,550
In prison

12
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,350
Supervisor Hu described what had happened the to Demon Sect to Ding Mao

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,950
Ding Yiqiu fought with the Demon Sect for twenty years

14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,070
It was Ding Yiqiu who robbed the dead infant

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,270
In order to remind the world that the Demon Sect has been revived

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,750
Ding Yiqiu asked Supervisor Hu

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,550
to kill him and sink his body

18
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,150
Supervisor Hu requested Ding Mao

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,310
to protect the estate left by his father

20
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,790
Tianjin

21
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,710
is different from now on

22
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,630
And it comes out that

23
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,350
Ghosts of Demon Sect pestered they three

24
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,910
They rushed into the ghost market and fought with the thief chief

25
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,350
And this draw out the inside story of water transport of grain to the capital

26
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,829
Tell me

27
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,510
When was the last time you saw your dad?

28
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,790
Where did you go yesterday?

29
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,269
Do you know who is behind us?

30
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,990
Dragon King, the great god of the river

31
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,350
If you have anything to say, tell the Dragon King

32
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,430
it will help you

33
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,150
How about telling you a story?

34
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,310
The aged say that

35
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,070
there used to be a kind of fish in the Hai River

36
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,030
It grew up like a sole

37
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,190
But it was bigger than a sole

38
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,950
much bigger

39
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,950
Especially with the long black fur

40
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,390
on its back

41
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,590
That's something!

42
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,550
This black hair also

43
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,190
Well, well, well

44
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,710
I'll stop. I won't say it

45
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,230
Well, well

46
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,270
What do you want to eat?

47
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,630
I'll take you to a good meal

48
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,430
Nuts cake?

49
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,150
Sweet pancake?

50
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,630
Or deep-fried dough stick?

51
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,950
Steamed stuffed bun?

52
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,430
Nah, there is too little meat in it

53
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,390
Upper part of a leg of pork is better

54
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,510
Then we'll eat

55
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,350
What's wrong?

56
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,150
What are you doing?

57
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,270
What are you doing?

58
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,350
Identify Corpse

59
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,870
The kid's still here

60
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,790
Is it appropriate?

61
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,150
This is not at Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

62
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,710
Can you stop being hot-tempered?

63
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,470
I have no time to talk nonsense with you

64
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,590
Stay away from my dad!

65
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,590
Go away!

66
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,430
Ding Mao

67
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,590
Now I am the chairman of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

68
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,510
This man belongs to Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

69
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,590
Ever since he entered the Chamber of Commerce

70
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,310
He worked himself to the bone for us

71
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,470
If anyone tries to stop me today

72
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,630
I'll let you all lie down with him.

73
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,630
Do you really think I dare not to beat you?

74
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,870
Let's go

75
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,030
It will be OK. He will solve it. Let's go

76
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,150
You have no idea

77
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,550
what an emergency this is

78
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,270
What do you have to do with a dead body?

79
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,230
Demon Sect

80
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,230
What?

81
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,950
You said the master died because of the Demon Sect

82
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,750
So Feng Erma's death

83
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,270
has something to do with it

84
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,150
What do you know?

85
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,550
The Demon Sect manipulates corpses with sorcery

86
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,190
and turn these people

87
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,590
into mindless beasts

88
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,750
Sorcery?

89
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,510
Manipulate corpse?

90
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,350
Mr. Ding, don't you always believe in science?

91
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,550
It is because I do not believe sorcery

92
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,830
that I have to find out

93
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,230
what's going on

94
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,910
If so

95
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,310
how can you prove that

96
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,630
the wound was bitten by a real beast

97
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,310
or by a man like a beast?

98
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,550
Can this prove it?

99
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,750
Finger marks, bruise

100
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,230
One finger is missing

101
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,190
The cook won't steal food unless the grains are not harvested

102
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,790
Waiters steal food and drinks

103
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,990
Fish is a must

104
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,230
But this tooth is rough

105
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,750
The owner of it must live on humble food

106
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,750
Not them

107
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,270
Pregnant women are like old people

108
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,070
They pay attention to soup, eat porridge and soft rice

109
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,310
Their teeth should be bright and hard

110
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,350
Not them

111
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,910
Hot-headed and strong man, is it a butcher?

112
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,030
Man's neck is so soft

113
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,310
But the killer lost his tooth

114
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,030
Could it be a patient with bad teeth?

115
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,390
Scholar? Official?

116
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,470
A servant of White Badge can't reach them at all

117
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,470
Unless it's someone he knows

118
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,550
So he didn't have precaution

119
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,270
If it was the butcher, why didn't he use a knife as tool?

120
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,270
No

121
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,830
The patient is weak

122
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,670
How could he

123
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,510
subdue  a coolie Feng Erma?

124
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,710
No

125
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,590
The murderer killed him secretly

126
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,550
How could the killer choose to bite?

127
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,830
It's too impulsive

128
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,470
No

129
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,590
Judging from the size and the degree of wear of the tooth

130
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,070
Not the young lady

131
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,070
Child? No

132
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,470
No

133
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,910
Then there are only two possibilities

134
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,190
One

135
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,190
It's a rich wife within their Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

136
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,550
He was killed because of adultery

137
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,350
But there are several ways to deal with it

138
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,750
It's not worth throwing bodies into the river

139
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,070
No

140
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,990
Then, the other possibility

141
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,630
Feng Erma was not bitten to death at all

142
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,190
People who knew medicine faked a wound

143
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,310
He deliberately put a broken tooth in it

144
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,350
trying to frame somebody

145
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,910
What's all this trouble for?

146
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,070
This is not reasonabe

147
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,030
Anyone else?

148
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,950
Whose tooth is this?

149
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,430
The dead people

150
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,710
Why are you smoking again

151
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,550
Dead body

152
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,990
Dead body?

153
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,070
Yes

154
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,630
That tooth belongs to a dead man

155
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,430
A dead man?

156
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,990
A dead man

157
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,230
Bitten Feng Er to death

158
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,190
Here

159
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,950
Come in, come in

160
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,630
How's it?

161
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,590
This is a nice room, isn't it

162
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,150
Let me tell you

163
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,150
This is the best room in the whole Dragon King Temple

164
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,750
You can live here from now on

165
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,790
Here, here

166
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,590
This bed is nice

167
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,070
Sit down and feel it

168
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,590
Isn't it very comfortable?

169
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,270
The man who just bullied you

170
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,230
used to live in this room

171
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,230
But now he is the chairman of chamber of commerce

172
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,230
He's definitely not coming back to live

173
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,710
Make yourself at home here.

174
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,630
Let me tell you

175
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,230
There's a lot of fun in this room

176
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,950
I'll show you

177
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,070
You see

178
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,470
What's this?

179
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,310
See it

180
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,630
Xiao Hai!

181
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,790
I own the chamber of commerce

182
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,590
Everyone must follow whatever I say

183
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,950
If anyone tries to stop me

184
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,030
I will let him die

185
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,990
You can take whatever you like

186
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,790
in this room

187
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,470
and sleep wherever you like

188
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,350
Do everything you want

189
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,550
It doesn't matter if you break anything

190
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,630
Anyway

191
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,110
It belongs to the chairman of chamber of commerce

192
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,030
Are you all right, Xiao Hai?

193
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,670
What's the matter?

194
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,230
It's all right

195
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,190
River Demon

196
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,950
Sir

197
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,310
Do we have scout in Yisheng Gang?

198
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,470
What are you inquiring about?

199
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,350
I am wondering if there is anyone Yisheng Gang

200
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,950
Missing a ring finger on his left hand

201
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,350
Finger marks, bruise, a finger is missing

202
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,870
OK. I will do it

203
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,670
The fourth finger of the left hand

204
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,710
What?

205
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,590
I don't know anyone in Yisheng Gang is like this

206
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,350
But there is a man in our Chamber of Commerce

207
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,990
Who?

208
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,950
A Red Badge Guard who helped Tianming to save the docks

209
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,230
My bro

210
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,070
Sun Laoqi

211
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,990
Dead person...

212
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,310
I beg your pardon?

213
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,110
You mean

214
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,790
What your dad and Supervisor Hu

215
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,030
is trying to do

216
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,430
is to reveal the Demonic cult?

217
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,750
Your dad is dead

218
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,070
and Supervisor Hu got into prison

219
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,750
You also took charge of the Chamber ofcommerce

220
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,550
you would not want to touch

221
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,390
We paid all the cost

222
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,270
is to make Demonic cult revealed

223
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,710
We hope that someone will stand out

224
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,110
and eliminate the cult

225
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,590
Do you think it's possible?

226
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,390
So we have to let everyone know that

227
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,190
the Demonic cult 20 years ago

228
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,710
has not been cut off completely

229
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,030
and it has recovered

230
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,590
Master is missing

231
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,670
So both of you put your dads into bad situation

232
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,990
Although I am wondering

233
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,390
what is happening here

234
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,750
Although I cannot accept

235
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,150
that Master is hiding the truth from me

236
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,710
it will be in vain

237
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,430
if we go there without any plan

238
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,150
Feng Er'ma was bitten to die by a dead person

239
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,510
It is obvious

240
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,910
The only clue right now

241
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,349
is to go to the door of life to find out

242
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,550
if there is a dead person whose finger was broken

243
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,589
And the corpse came to life

244
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,869
You also see the finger trace

245
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,630
on his arm of the dead person

246
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,030
Don't crap

247
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,869
But after all you're wrong

248
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,750
We don't need to go to the door of life

249
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,110
there is the one in Caoyun Chamber of commerce

250
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,270
I think it's too much

251
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,070
Let me tell you

252
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,070
Sun Laoqi is dead for sure

253
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,630
and he was buried in this coffin

254
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,710
It's impossible that he bit Feng to die

255
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,870
It doesn't make any sense

256
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,310
Agree

257
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,670
It's so rare that we make an agreement

258
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,950
I think we should go back

259
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,590
We  will get our comeuppance if we dig grave without permission

260
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,630
I'll get all the punishments

261
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,710
This is nothing to do with you

262
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,390
So why did you bring me here?

263
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,870
You said you want to find Master

264
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,190
Once the cult appears, Master would disappear

265
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,950
Listen

266
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,590
Figuring out the relations of Sun and Feng

267
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,430
and the cult

268
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,390
will help us find Master

269
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,790
I got your point

270
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,070
but one question

271
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,190
What?

272
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,070
Does it have anything to do with you?

273
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,310
Of course

274
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,510
Let me tell you

275
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,150
After all, I was raised by a witch

276
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,230
You need an adept

277
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,990
coming to this place

278
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,270
Let me help you check out

279
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,990
You are a fake adept

280
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,390
Are you kidding?

281
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,470
Look

282
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,530
The soldiers, you need to listen

283
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,270
You ask the country code stopping the army

284
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,030
You care about the homeland touching the saddle

285
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,480
I, as a fairy, live neither the south nor the north

286
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,470
neither around waters nor in mountains

287
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,150
Brother Guo

288
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,390
Brother Guo

289
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,710
Is ghost pounding the wall

290
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,270
What are you talking about

291
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,430
Me, a fairy

292
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,070
I just took a walk

293
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,150
You shut down

294
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,950
You had ghost on bed everyday when you were a child

295
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,030
You wet the bed everyday

296
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,110
There wasn't enough time to change the bed sheet

297
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,790
Stop

298
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,030
When walk in the dark, we see trees not roads

299
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,990
The roads are the same

300
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,030
but the trees are changing

301
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,710
Follow me

302
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,590
To where

303
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,110
To a safe place

304
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,590
Pick up the sword

305
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,350
Is this the safe place you talked about

306
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,110
There are too many bodies lying under and accompanying you

307
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,110
It's safe, isn't it

308
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,790
Can you stop terrifying me

309
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,510
Don't be a coward

310
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,910
You were raised by a witch, weren't you

311
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,390
You're a fairy, aren't you

312
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,190
Even if there is a ghost

313
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,990
he will not hurt you, right

314
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,430
What are you looking at, help me

315
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,190
I helped out a buddy who

316
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,150
were lost just now

317
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,510
which cost me a lot of energy

318
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,910
I need to rest

319
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,070
Can you stop whining

320
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,710
Get down to your work

321
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,390
Why did you choose digging grave in the evening

322
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,390
There is no one in the morning

323
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,670
Gold-touchers don't choose the time in the morning

324
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,270
We are not gold-touchers

325
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,390
We come here just to check the corpses

326
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,790
We need to obey the old saying

327
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,990
Don't just stand there

328
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,270
Go help Chairman Ding

329
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,470
I'll go on patrol

330
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,910
and help you check it out

331
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,550
Give me a suitable weapon

332
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,670
The coffin was touched by someone else

333
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,790
How can you tell

334
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,510
There is no coffin nail

335
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,870
Who did touch it

336
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,230
Us

337
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,790
Sun escaped by himself

338
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,110
and bit Feng to die

339
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,630
No way

340
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,710
It really depends

341
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,870
Up

342
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,630
This coffin was opened by someone else

343
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,150
You mean Dao Dou

344
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,990
What

345
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,870
Grave robber

346
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,190
How do you know

347
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,870
The rules of grave robbing in TianJin

348
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,310
After the coffin was opened

349
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,590
the nails wouldn't be hammered back

350
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,670
instead, the nails will be put into the coffin

351
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,510
What does it mean is to tell the peer

352
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,590
that this coffin has been opened before

353
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,790
and to tell them not to waste their efforts

354
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,030
Also, you see

355
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,790
there is a trace of Sanchi Pry

356
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,110
What pry

357
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,950
There is Emperor Wen drum and Ghost Chasing Whip in God Dancing

358
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,830
and Luo Yang Shovel and San Chi Pry in Grave Robbing

359
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,750
All of them are specialized tools

360
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,550
Well what tools do you have in corpses retrieval

361
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,990
Nothing

362
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,830
but the skills we have

363
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,430
Do you think it's possible that

364
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,190
the coffin was empty when it was buried

365
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,710
Sun was not dead at all

366
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,510
Thieves do not leave without anything

367
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,350
What if the empty coffin was buried

368
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,710
Well the grave robber must have taken

369
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,550
one coffin nail

370
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,590
now there are complete 7 nails

371
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,950
so they must have taken something else

372
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,150
from this coffin

373
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,830
Could it be a cenotaph

374
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,870
Unless he died in a foreign land or

375
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,070
his corpse didn't exist

376
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,870
What's more, they will try to remain the complete corpse when they bury the body

377
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,870
The clothes worn before he died should be complete

378
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,270
Although Sun is the guard with red medal

379
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,630
in Cao Yun Chamber of Commerce

380
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,990
He is not rich

381
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,310
in addition

382
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,390
clothes is the cheapest thing

383
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,670
among all the sacrifice

384
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,350
There is no need for the grave robbers taking all of them

385
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,150
What other possibility could be

386
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,190
Could it be the local ghost

387
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,990
Can these grave robbers be related to

388
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,270
the coffin of Sun

389
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,470
Could be

390
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,630
Calm down

391
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,190
I know where they are heading to

392
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,150
Where

393
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,910
You've been there

394
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,150
Where is this

395
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,150
Ghost market

396
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,390
Even though they open business in the evening

397
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,830
they should make it bright

398
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,790
They cannot be under the light

399
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,470
What cannot be under the light

400
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,470
Both things and

401
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,710
people

402
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,710
What do they sell

403
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,110
You can buy anything you can'y buy outside

404
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,950
What do you like

405
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,070
Don't miss if you meet

406
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,590
You can't do it outside

407
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,230
but you can do here

408
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,870
When did the stone come out

409
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,270
That's jade

410
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,470
Jade

411
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,910
Are grave robbers here

412
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,750
How much of the jade

413
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,310
It's up to you

414
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,390
No refund if you give more. No goods if you give less.

415
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,030
Money

416
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,550
What for

417
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,830
Buy news

418
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,270
Put it on

419
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,150
Put it on

420
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,990
I didn't say it's a deal

421
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,110
You said it's up to me

422
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,470
This is jade

423
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,630
This amount of money is for beggars

424
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,150
Put it a nice way, this is a jade

425
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,350
Put it a simple way, this is a stone

426
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,430
You need to use the rough  one replacing the nice one within a proper range, right

427
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,110
No refund if you give more. No goods if you give less.

428
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,950
The bracelet only worth for one silver dollar

429
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,430
I'll use the left money to ask you about some people

430
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,910
Who

431
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,710
That buddy has asked just now

432
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,550
Where do those who pretend ghost soldiers

433
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,590
distribute what they've got

434
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,950
This is ghost market, not outside

435
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,030
Doing business is not important

436
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,590
the important thing is the rules

437
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,950
Your identities are secret, which is

438
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,710
the taboo if speak out

439
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,510
Do you think I'll embarrass my buddies

440
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,510
just for the little money

441
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,470
Don't flatter yourself

442
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,590
Grave robbers call jade as stone

443
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,070
You don't know about that

444
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,710
so how dare you saying you're with them

445
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,510
If you're buddies

446
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,910
how could you sell this craps here

447
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,950
Who would bury their bodies

448
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,470
with these things

449
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,110
Sure

450
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,950
Rules are fixed, but people are flexible

451
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,150
Sometimes

452
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,190
taboo or not taboo

453
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,750
it depends on your sincerity

454
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,030
Are we sincere

455
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,470
You are decent people without any doubt

456
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,430
I can feel sorry for you

457
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,350
but I can't feel sorry for money

458
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,750
If you really want to find nice things

459
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,150
please go upstairs

460
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,550
The woods are unusual.

461
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,590
Keep away from the two sides.

462
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,630
Follow me.

463
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,190
Why do these people

464
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,470
have so many rules?

465
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,190
They're heretical.

466
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,990
They get money

467
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,190
by doing shady business.

468
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,710
Rules must be established in that case,

469
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,310
so that they know what can be done

470
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,390
and what cannot.

471
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,630
With rules,

472
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,390
they can be candid with each other.

473
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,270
People of all walks of life

474
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,550
have their own needs and taboos.

475
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,750
So sometimes it's difficult for them to reach an agreement.

476
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,110
But with rules,

477
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,190
for one thing,

478
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,550
difficulties can be reduced.

479
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,830
For another,

480
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,070
they can identify their accomplices and enemies

481
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,710
Most importantly,

482
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,310
they can keep some secrets from each other.

483
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,270
When do you begin

484
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,310
to be concerned about such things?

485
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,310
Didn't you look down upon

486
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,550
them all the time?

487
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,030
I used to think that these things are far away from me.

488
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,230
But it's different  now.

489
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,630
There's so much for me to learn.

490
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,670
Far away from you?

491
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,950
The Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

492
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,750
is essentially the biggest faction in Tianjin.

493
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,910
If you work harder,

494
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,590
you will be able to achieve the unification.

495
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,590
Here we are.

496
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,350
There's no need for an introduction, buddies.

497
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,110
We met each other just now.

498
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,630
What do you mean?

499
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,670
We only met the dead.

500
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,030
That's great.

501
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,270
We're here today

502
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,150
to ask for information about the dead.

503
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,430
Have you robbed

504
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,110
the grave of Sun Ying or Sun Loaqi?

505
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,750
This is the way you ask for information?

506
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,350
I didn't bring enough money today.

507
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,870
But if you answer my questions,

508
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,230
I will send someone to give you money tomorrow.

509
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,510
I don't buy it.

510
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,750
Let's make it clear.

511
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,070
What do you want?

512
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,830
If you're not here to take things,

513
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,469
then get your ass out of here.

514
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,230
Don't disturb me.

515
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,949
You mean

516
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,870
you yield only to force?

517
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,270
It's funny

518
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,030
to see the shovel versus the whip.

519
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,190
These are your weapons used to make a living.

520
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,150
But my friend is fierce.

521
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,429
You guys

522
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,270
are active only at night,

523
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:46,150
and always do wicked business.

524
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,870
You must be very weak.

525
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,870
I'm afraid you're not strong enough

526
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,150
to fight against her.

527
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,190
What's more,

528
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,110
we're here to help her.

529
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,510
Brother Guo, what to do now?

530
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,830
Do you see the strong tree?

531
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,790
On the tree, you can see the second branch on the right

532
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,390
which is blocked

533
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,590
by leaves of the front tree.

534
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,510
Do you see it?

535
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,470
Yes.

536
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,070
Aim at that position

537
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,070
and throw this at it.

538
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,910
Try your best.

539
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,790
This is my mother's Beckoning Soul Bell.

540
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,950
She still needs it to do religious rites.

541
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,190
Relax.

542
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,110
Someone will bring it back to you.

543
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,430
You mean that position?

544
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,990
Throw it!

545
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,390
No!

546
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,350
Why do you only hit me?

547
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,270
He is the only person in this wood.

548
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,790
Don't try to cheat us.

549
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,190
You learned tricks from bandits,

550
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,670
but it doesn't work.

551
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,230
Aren't you afraid of breeding enmity with people?

552
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,750
You even disguised yourselves as ghosts.

553
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,150
Do you think what year it is?

554
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,910
These tricks can only fool children.

555
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,630
May I ask

556
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,750
what path you belong to?

557
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,790
We're from the right path.

558
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,870
The primary one or the secondary one?

559
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,910
See by yourself!

560
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,830
Haven't I told you clearly enough?

561
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,630
What primary and secondary ones.

562
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,350
This is the newly inaugurated chairman Ding

563
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,270
of the Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation.

564
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,110
If he were the chairman of the Chamber,

565
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,150
I would be the British consul.

566
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,830
You're truly the chairman.

567
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,270
Chairman, I'm sorry.

568
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,310
I've seen you before.

569
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,430
Hurry! Hurry!

570
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,790
Chairman,

571
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,950
I've seen you on a newspaper.

572
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,190
How come such a distinguished guest like you

573
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,110
came here?

574
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,270
You don't know why I'm here?

575
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,270
You came for that?

576
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,030
Nonsense.

577
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,750
The chairman came in person.

578
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,990
What else can he come for?

579
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,710
About that,

580
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,590
it's indeed our fault.

581
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,790
What fault?

582
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,990
We had taken the silver flagons and silk scarves

583
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,430
before the corpse was carried away.

584
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,590
You mean the corpse of Sun Laoqi?

585
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,550
Yes.

586
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,950
Since the chairman is here,

587
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,150
I guess you must come to know about this issue.

588
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,070
Sure.

589
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,390
But those valuable things

590
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,030
have been sold out.

591
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,070
You won't care about such a little money

592
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,550
even if we return it back to you.

593
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,270
I'm clear about the rules.

594
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,910
Chairman, we'd like to

595
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,150
receive punishment.

596
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,910
The money given by the Chamber

597
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,630
is not enough for you?

598
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,990
What do you mean?

599
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,710
The Chamber gives money to you

600
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,070
on a regular basis.

601
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,190
Its purpose is to prevent you

602
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,790
from stealing things from tombs.

603
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,150
So that the dead can rest in peace.

604
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,230
Since you know the rules,

605
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,590
you should explain to the chairman

606
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,510
why you robbed

607
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,550
the grave of Sun Laoqi.

608
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,750
Wait a second.

609
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,630
Aren't we off the point?

610
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,070
What do you mean?

611
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,470
Every year we get money

612
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,990
from the Chamber.

613
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,590
Most of people

614
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,470
are clear about the rules.

615
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,470
If we violate the rules,

616
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,910
it'll be impossible for us to gain a firm foothold?

617
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,110
But you just told us

618
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,790
that you took the silk scarves and flagons

619
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,270
away.

620
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,910
You insist that you didn't open Sun Laoqi's grave?

621
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,230
Taking things away is our fault.

622
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,710
But there was someone who paid us

623
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,910
to open the grave.

624
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,070
That's another business.

625
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,710
Someone gave you money

626
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,830
and asked you to open the grave?

627
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,910
Yes.

628
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,150
We open graves for many reasons.

629
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,430
If some missing bones of a corpse

630
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,510
was found,

631
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,230
people ask us to open the grave.

632
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,550
And he who likes to move a grave to another place

633
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,390
or change the coffin for a bigger one,

634
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,910
will come to us for our superb skills.

635
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,510
No matter how badly the grave is dug,

636
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,350
we can rebuild it to what it looks like at the beginning

637
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,710
after we finish our tasks.

638
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,430
This is called skilled.

639
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,630
You mean

640
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,110
someone of the Chamber paid you

641
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,630
to dig out Sun Laoqi's coffin?

642
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,350
Sun Laoqi is a guard of the Chamber

643
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,310
with a red badge.

644
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,270
You're just a subordinate with a white badge.

645
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,350
You can make decisions for him?

646
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,910
We're divided into people with white, blue, red, silver and gold badges.

647
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,110
But after we're dead,

648
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,390
we're essentially members of the Chamber.

649
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:39,830
Why can't I decide?

650
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,990
Your words make sense.

651
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,470
But this is asked by yourself

652
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,230
or by others

653
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,550
who're inconvenient to show up?

654
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,190
You really want to know?

655
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,310
No.

656
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,750
Don't ask too much.

657
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,870
Just tell me if you're in?

658
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,310
All right.

659
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,110
Please tell me what to do.

660
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,870
Dig out the corpse and give it to me.

661
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,990
Don't move other things.

662
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,590
I see.

663
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,150
But we have never done

664
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,230
such things.

665
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,510
Wait a second.

666
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,790
I did promise him

667
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,710
not to take other things.

668
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,990
But I just can't help

669
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,310
taking valuables away

670
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,870
Before the corpse was carried away,

671
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,470
those valuable things had been taken by us.

672
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,790
We're ashamed.

673
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,670
Chairman,

674
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,830
it seems that your men

675
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,590
don't believe in heresy.

676
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,510
The dead person has been buried.

677
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,910
It's improper to dig out the corpse

678
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,310
and ship it away.

679
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,710
Otherwise the corpse might be alive again!

680
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,950
Who paid you?

681
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,150
You have no idea?

682
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,310
Yes.

683
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,350
Well.

684
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,510
I've said too much.

685
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,670
Didn't he have an identity card?

686
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,790
He had.

687
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,310
But I forgot what it says.

688
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,870
I didn't pay attention to it.

689
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,790
You should remember

690
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,910
what he looks like.

691
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,390
Not at all.

692
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,070
I didn't recognize you

693
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,350
until you show your identity.

694
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,630
The ghost market is a place to do shady business.

695
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,230
Making it hard to identify the faces of each other

696
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,630
can help avoid getting in trouble.

697
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,630
But,

698
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,430
I think that person is a fisherman.

699
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,270
A fisherman?

700
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,990
He wore a pair of waders
