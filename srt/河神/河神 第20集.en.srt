[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,400
Previously on Tientsin Mystic

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,010
Guo Deyou and Xiao Lanlan learned from a prison guard

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,260
that there was a special cell.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,070
The prisoner there was extremely dangerous

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,140
which is the Preacher of the Demonic Cult.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,220
When Ding Mao and Captain Fu arrived,

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,550
a prison guard was killed.

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,680
Guo Deyou sneaked into the cells.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,980
The prisoner in the special cell broke prison

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,640
and hypnotized the warden.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,150
Ding Mao and Captain Fu found that Huang Yu vanished.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,770
Then Ding and Fu ran into Guo Deyou.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,350
When Guo and Ding were rushing to the special cell,

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,990
the warden released all the prisoners.

16
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,530
A riot was about to burst.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,500
Huang Yu regained consciousness,

18
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,340
and rescued the Preacher of the Demonic Cult, the little Immortal.

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,580
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao reached the special cell,

20
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,610
while the Preacher had already escaped.

21
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,090
They two told from the situation

22
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,200
that the Preacher must be a master of hypnosis.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,350
When a prisoner was insulting Xiao Lanlan,

24
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,970
Ding Mao stood out and went to her rescue.

25
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,230
Yu Si with the Grain Transportation gang arrived,

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,410
and fought with the prisoners.

27
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,340
Here is the story next: the riot is put down but Huang Yu dies.

28
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,239
The little Immortal disappeares without a trace 
and Ding Mao enters the Xiao's mansion.

29
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,310
San Ye is so furious, which causes a huge disaster.

30
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,310
Don't touch me. I am not drunk.

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,750
Be careful.

32
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,400
Old man, what time is it?

33
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,030
What's the time!

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,900
He's deaf and blind.

35
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,050
Let's go. Run!

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,110
Hurry up! Come on!

37
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,860
My shoe dropped.

38
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,540
Go to hell!

39
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,270
Screw you!

40
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,020
Get lost!

41
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,860
Young Master!

42
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,220
Go to hell!

43
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,290
No shooting.

44
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,290
Put these bastards back into jail.

45
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,080
Yes, Sir!

46
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,220
How lovely the girl is! It's sad that you're hypnotized.

47
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,140
Little girl, the gun...

48
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,200
is not for everyone to play with,

49
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,180
let alone your arms are so tiny.

50
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,600
I bet you could not hit me.

51
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,030
Unfortunately I was wrong.

52
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,180
Get lost!

53
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,520
Young Master!

54
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,230
Let go of me!

55
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,010
Get up!

56
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,790
Don't move.

57
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,680
Where's my young Master? And Ding Mao?

58
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,500
Here.

59
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,750
Young Master!

60
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,250
Young Master, are you all right?

61
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,750
I'm fine.

62
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,330
Send Miss Xiao home at once.

63
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,660
Miss Xiao, are you...

64
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,530
Young Master, are you...

65
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,180
Don't worry. I'm all right.

66
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,980
Go ahead.

67
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,670
Take care.

68
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,600
Hurry up!

69
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,500
Buddies of the Grain Transportation, let's go.

70
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,580
Let's go.

71
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,440
Be careful.

72
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,330
Move.

73
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,190
Come over. Hurry up!

74
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,510
If anyone messes around, beat him to death!

75
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,740
Are you all right?

76
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,940
What do you think?

77
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,900
Huang Yu.

78
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,880
Master Huang, long time no see.

79
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,480
Your kung fu's much improved.

80
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,530
Magic School Revival is around the corner.

81
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,230
Sorry, I put a stop to it.

82
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,920
Right here today.

83
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,530
Is he also hypnotized?

84
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,790
Magic School Revival, right here today.

85
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,560
Magic School Revival, right here...

86
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,100
I told you no shooting

87
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,060
and you did hear me.

88
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,340
How's it?

89
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,500
Nothing at all. Holding breath is my special skill.

90
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm not asking you about that. How's the little girl?

91
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,760
She's still in the cell, but I think she's fine.

92
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,560
How about you?

93
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,860
I asked Yu Si to send Xiao Lanlan back home.

94
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,480
I'm not asking you about that. How's little Immortal?

95
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,680
I didn't see him.

96
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,710
Attention!

97
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,380
Put them back to the cells.

98
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,160
Come on!

99
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,370
Hurry up!

100
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,350
Come on!

101
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,470
Move! Come on!

102
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,140
Everybody be serious!

103
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,890
Besides the cells,

104
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,130
all the public areas, dining rooms, lounges,

105
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:47,090
locker rooms, laundry rooms,

106
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,250
every pipe and every brick

107
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,470
all must be thoroughly searched.

108
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,040
If there is anyone who escapes...

109
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,200
Stop. Don't fire. We're on your side.

110
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,760
We're on your side, Sir.

111
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,220
Take them down.

112
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,970
Don't move!

113
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,470
Don't do that, Sir.

114
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,300
Hold on. Hold on.

115
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,740
Sir, I'm Fu Laiyong, the police captain.

116
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,800
As for these two guys,

117
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,590
one is the special detective,

118
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,090
the other is the captain of the Corpse Retrieval team.

119
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,200
They all belong to our police department.

120
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,250
The prisoners wanted to escape,

121
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,190
so they put on the prison clothes to infiltrate into them,

122
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,570
to disorganize from the inside.

123
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,500
You can check the prisoner list.

124
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,730
They are definitely not on the list.

125
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,100
Let them go.

126
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,960
Many thanks！

127
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,400
Sir, why are you here?

128
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,580
To quell the riot.

129
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,910
You are too late.

130
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,220
We police has already taken care of it.

131
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,900
Here in the prison is very safe.

132
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,120
Everything is under control.

133
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,140
The prison is now taken over by us.

134
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,740
You should leave now.

135
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,190
What?

136
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,630
Look, we've arranged

137
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,670
all the follow-up work.

138
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,710
Leave now.

139
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,470
Hey,

140
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,420
how could you take over as you please?

141
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,230
We risked our lives

142
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,610
to save the Xiaoxiguan Prison.

143
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,750
You want to take all the credits

144
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,170
just with a few guns?

145
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,470
You must be kidding me.

146
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,350
You're right. I'm taking it over with guns.

147
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,610
Sir, we'll leave soon.

148
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,070
Before that, I just wanna kindly remind you

149
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,490
that there is still a prisoner not found.

150
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
The special category prisoner is very violent

151
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,640
What's happening in prison

152
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,870
is none of your business

153
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,330
All prisoners will be handled carefully

154
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,680
Don't interfere with the army's job

155
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,450
Get out!

156
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,570
Is Little Immortal confirmed dead?

157
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,690
Dead as a doornail

158
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,830
Did you witness it?

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
Yes. He was killed by one shot

160
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,210
Good

161
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,230
I need to check the body

162
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,010
The body was handled by the army

163
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,180
He died brutally. The body was buried

164
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,480
Buried?

165
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:56,890
Yes

166
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,290
I spared his life till now

167
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,650
thinking one day he might be of use

168
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,210
Since he is dead,

169
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,450
at least the body should be kept

170
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,610
I could ask one to examine

171
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,790
what's in his brain

172
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,280
that differs from ordinary people

173
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,970
But now it is buried

174
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,980
Who told you to bury the body?

175
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,120
Why didn't you seek my approval?

176
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,380
Secretary General, I am sorry for my negligence

177
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,820
Shall I dig the body out

178
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,720
and remove his eyeballs?

179
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,790
The eyes are unlike that of ordinary people

180
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,280
No need

181
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,480
Yes sir

182
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,420
What a beautiful jasmine flower

183
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,920
What are you doing here?

184
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,740
I'm leaving tomorrow

185
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,900
I didn't want to disturb you

186
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,640
About what happened at the consulate

187
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,980
I want to thank you in person

188
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,920
Deyou is not here

189
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,410
It doesn't matter

190
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,310
Thanks to you too

191
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,440
What are you doing?

192
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,740
Thank you

193
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,530
Don't worry about it

194
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,000
We couldn't let you die in that situation

195
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,650
I was supposed to apologize to you

196
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,580
I hit you that day and knocked you out

197
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,860
I know you were trying to save me

198
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,140
I am able to survive thanks to you

199
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,040
Don't mention it

200
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,200
But why are you suddenly leaving?

201
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,350
The film crew is suspended after the serious accident

202
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,089
I don't know when the filming will resume

203
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,569
I can't stay in Tientsin forever

204
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,810
It must be great to do your job

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
You can travel to many places

206
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,010
and broaden your horizons

207
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,930
The time and places to visit,

208
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,319
the people to meet and things to do

209
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,579
are not the decisions that I can make

210
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,609
Miss Gu, I truly admire you

211
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,810
You are free as a bird

212
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,070
and you have a nice guy by your side

213
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
Me?

214
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,210
How could there be

215
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,410
any guy by my side?

216
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,990
Mr. Guo

217
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,090
Him?

218
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,130
He'd rather avoid me everyday

219
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,160
As an actress, I came across lots of people

220
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,970
When they first saw me,

221
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,280
their eyes flashed with

222
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,950
desire or frivolity

223
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,040
But Mr. Guo is different

224
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,030
When he looks at me,

225
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,970
his eyes are pure and clean

226
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,090
He sees others the same way

227
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,500
Only when he looks at you,

228
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,870
there is something else.

229
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,170
What is it?

230
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,730
It's hard to say. It's something

231
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,330
I‘ve also never experienced

232
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,530
Captain Fu was wounded in a fight for Tientsin people

233
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,480
What an honourable act!

234
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,680
Stop it! Brag about yourself

235
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,670
Open it

236
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,940
What is it?

237
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,190
The nature of Xiao Xiguan Prison's case was determined

238
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,420
as a riot

239
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,190
It was suppressed by the army

240
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,550
The core of the riot was the special category prisoner

241
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,120
He was shot dead on the spot

242
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,980
The news is withheld so all is at peace

243
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,490
Little Immortal is dead?

244
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,870
What did you call him?

245
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,510
He seemed mysterious and immortal

246
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,640
so I gave him a nickname

247
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,060
Is he really dead?

248
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,820
Written in black and white. Any more doubts?

249
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,690
No but we didn't witness it

250
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,090
It was handled by Secretary General

251
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,800
He doesn't need to report to you

252
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,390
He won't kill anybody he wants

253
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,590
Even if the prisoner had remarkable power,

254
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,410
he couldn't survive a bullet

255
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,190
A conclusion seems to be reached

256
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,730
But I'm not done with you two

257
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,050
For what?

258
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,500
How did you hear of a special category prisoner

259
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,560
being locked in Xiao Xiguan Prison?

260
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,910
Be honest. What do you want？

261
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,200
The special category prisoner

262
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,140
is a key member of Mogudao

263
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,970
It's said that he has special power

264
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,550
When wiping out Mogudao twenty years ago,

265
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,720
because this prisoner

266
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,030
our army suffered heavy losses

267
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,740
Now Mogudao is causing riots again

268
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,910
The army had to suppress them again

269
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,570
Don't you think it is similar to

270
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,400
what happened twenty years ago?

271
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,410
You certainly know a lot

272
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,450
What's on your mind?

273
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,840
What are you up to?

274
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,860
What have you got up in your sleeve?

275
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,390
Nothing. I do not dare.

276
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,680
What do you see on this file?

277
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,370
CONFIDENTIAL

278
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,870
Why can you still take a look?

279
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,000
Do you know?

280
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,080
It was an undercover mission by the army

281
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,110
The news must be completely withheld

282
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,610
You troublemakers are irrelevant

283
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,980
If you caused any trouble due to the riot

284
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,630
I won't be the one who blame you

285
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,200
Secretary General will blame you

286
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,930
The prisoner is dead

287
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,490
But Mogudao is left unfinished

288
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,060
There's still Lian Huaqing

289
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,070
Shut up! Shut up!

290
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,200
Don't even mention Mogudao

291
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,300
They are none of your business

292
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,280
Leave me alone

293
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,230
I'm getting a headache

294
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,490
Go away. Get out!

295
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,240
Don't forget what I just told you

296
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,060
I used to have bias towards you

297
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,660
Please don't mind

298
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,520
You are a good person to me now

299
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,620
I'm just a woman

300
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,310
You and Mr. Guo

301
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,190
and Chairman Ding

302
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,390
are indeed good people

303
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,650
Goodbye Miss Gu.

304
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,860
Will you return to Tientsin?

305
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,880
As I said

306
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,070
The time and places to visit

307
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,300
are not the decisions that I can make.

308
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,730
A women should never follow behind a man

309
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,600
You must know what to pursue and

310
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,170
live for yourself to make life meaningful

311
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,910
It's too late for me

312
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,550
Hope you can fulfill it

313
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,980
Miss

314
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,010
are you feeling better?

315
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,610
Xiao Xiguan is unsafe. Why did you go?

316
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,290
Some private matter

317
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,370
Does it involve using family as an excuse

318
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,670
to check a special category prisoner?

319
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,050
Why bother ask if you already know?

320
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,320
The prisoner is extremely dangerous

321
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,470
How did you know about it?

322
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,110
I'm not obliged to tell you everything

323
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,920
I just want to ensure your safety

324
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,700
Thank you

325
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,630
Miss, anything related to Guo Deyou and Ding Mao

326
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,600
is unsafe

327
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,290
Please stay away from them

328
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,080
This is not the first time reminding you

329
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,840
I‘m not feeling well

330
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,060
You may leave now

331
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,810
I want to take a rest

332
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,320
If you want to mess with me, it's on

333
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,270
Do whatever you want

334
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,510
But if you hurt Lanlan,

335
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,320
I'll risk my life to protect her

336
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,330
Your life and all lives

337
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,530
need to be evolved

338
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,530
How can your little desire

339
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,860
stop my plan?

340
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,720
You know what

341
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,170
I'm sick of your boring nonsense

342
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,280
The Preacher is dead. The Holy Child is missing

343
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,870
Mogudao is doomed

344
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,650
I no longer have anything

345
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,030
to do with Mogudao

346
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,740
The Xiao treat you like a dog

347
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,760
You sure do bite

348
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,270
The Preacher can't be killed with some gun

349
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,510
Give up. It's over

350
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,800
You won't find the Holy Child

351
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,700
Your illness won't let you live long

352
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,670
Even if the Preacher died,

353
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,670
I shall need to

354
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,880
find his body

355
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,660
You should dust carefully

356
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,520
You didn't even touch the back of the chair

357
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,950
I really can't stand you doing housework

358
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,040
Then you do it

359
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,020
I can't raise my injured arm or else

360
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,010
I won't need your help with housework

361
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,450
From now on

362
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,350
Please don't risk your life again

363
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,400
Especially don't keep it from me

364
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,700
Okay

365
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,680
Let me serve the soup before it cools down

366
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,230
Sit down

367
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,140
Why?

368
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,160
Stay with me for a while

369
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,070
What did I do wrong in my past lives?

370
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,320
Now Gu Ying and I have to

371
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,340
owe so much to you and Master Guo

372
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,690
Mum what are you saying?

373
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,680
Shut up and get out

374
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,450
I need to talk to Deyou

375
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,950
Deyou is ill. I must take care of him

376
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,970
Go ahead. I won't interrupt

377
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,680
Get out!

378
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,030
-You're badly wounded.

379
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,440
You must made a big trouble.

380
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,750
-Just a  skin wound, it doesn't matter.

381
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,120
-I want to tell you something.

382
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,920
Your master and I are good friends,

383
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,830
you know.

384
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,630
-Sure.

385
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,640
-You have grown up with Ying, haven't you?

386
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,920
-Sure.

387
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,660
-So,

388
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,090
Ying is like your own sister,

389
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,980
right?

390
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,910
-Sure.

391
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,630
No, not my own sister.

392
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,140
-Though you're as intimate as brother and sister,

393
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,700
Ying has grown up,

394
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,130
if you get too closer,

395
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,310
it'll become the gossip.

396
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:29,260
-What do you mean?

397
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,610
-Let me be clear,

398
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,270
Mr. Zhang in Yujia Pu

399
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,150
has been into Ying long ago.

400
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,750
His family is rich and he is handsome.

401
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,840
His personality,

402
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,470
as people know, is very tender.

403
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,000
I want to

404
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,900
match them up.

405
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,760
What's your opinion?

406
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,890
-Mr. Zhang?

407
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,100
Why don't you say Mr. Wang's son,

408
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,990
Zhao Laosi?

409
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,860
-You're talking nonsense.

410
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,630
If you regard Ying as your sister,

411
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,840
recently,

412
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,330
don't get too closer with her.

413
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,700
-Elder brother is like the father,

414
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,670
I don't agree with that.

415
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,250
-You're going too far.

416
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,510
-Gu Ying won't agree as well.

417
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,710
-It is not up to her.

418
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,020
-You're adding trouble to that.

419
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,200
It makes us afraid.

420
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,870
-Witch,

421
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,340
you know I'm not that kind of person.

422
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,850
However, i'm getting into trouble.

423
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,780
My master, your good old friend,

424
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,560
is still missing.

425
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,770
If I don't figure out

426
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,650
what's going on with Demon Sect,

427
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,590
We can't live in peace

428
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,220
in Tianjin City.

429
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,830
And how could you arrange your daughter

430
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,620
in Tianjin City?

431
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,350
-How could you find out the truth?

432
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,570
It has been there for 20 years,

433
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,100
but nobody find out the truth.

434
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,820
-Don't underestimate me,

435
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm an extraordinary talent.

436
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,080
I've already found out

437
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,590
the Preacher.

438
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,860
He was executed by the military.

439
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,980
Eradicating of the sect is only a matter of time.

440
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,590
-The Preacher?

441
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,580
-He has been arrested in Xiao Xiguan Prison

442
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,480
for more than 20 years.

443
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
-Have you saw him?

444
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,050
-No.

445
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,200
-Why did you say that?

446
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,380
-I found him out.

447
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,860
-Did he die?

448
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,760
-Yes.

449
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,600
-Are you sure?

450
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,400
-I'm sure.

451
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,800
-How could you say that without seeing him?

452
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,760
How dare you?

453
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,520
-Em...

454
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,260
-Gu Ying, come back.

455
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,070
-I should appreciate you on my own.

456
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,590
Why are you here?

457
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,720
-Nothing, I just stopped by.

458
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,480
What's going on with you?

459
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
-Thank you.

460
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,030
-Don't think so. I'm a little bit embarrassed.

461
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,130
-What's going on with Guo Deyou?

462
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,340
-He is a pachyderm

463
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,660
and everything goes well.

464
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,190
He must be squabbling

465
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,540
with Gu Ying at home.

466
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,840
-This couple is interesting,

467
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,930
they're thinking about each other,

468
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,260
but they'll still squabble.

469
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,630
-So they must stay together to constrain each other.

470
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,470
If they fall apart,

471
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,330
they'll hurt other people.

472
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,260
-Excuse me,

473
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,650
Secretary General Xiao wants to talk with Chairman Ding.

474
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,220
-Chairman Ding,

475
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,210
-Secretary General Xiao, just call me Ding Mao.

476
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,780
-Take a seat, please.

477
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,770
You're young, promising

478
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,740
and have a good look.

479
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,110
-Mr. Xiao, you're extraordinary.

480
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,320
Lanlan is so stubborn since she is a child,

481
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,740
it makes me worried.

482
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,720
Thanks for you help in Xiao Xiguan Prison,

483
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,650
or it would be a big trouble.

484
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,590
-You're welcome. It's just an easy work.

485
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,560
Miss Xiao is blessed with good fortune.

486
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,200
Thanks.

487
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,690
-I really appreciate you for this thing

488
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,310
and want to thank you.

489
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,489
But the ordinary gift

490
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,370
is not good enough for you.

491
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,639
Besides, her life can't be

492
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,050
measured by money.

493
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:22,900
What do you think?

494
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:23,929
-Not at all.

495
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,389
-If you have any need in your work,

496
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,340
I'll try my best to help you.

497
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,270
For Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation,

498
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,260
you can count on me.

499
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,820
-Thank you for your frankness and treatment,

500
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,139
it's a good news

501
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,080
for our chamber.

502
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,110
-I have another thing to ask you.

503
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,969
-Please.

504
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
-Mr. Ding, I would like to ask you

505
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,700
do you like Lanlan?

506
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,820
-Em...

507
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,700
-She is my daughter,

508
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,840
and I know her very well.

509
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,050
I hope you don't meet each other any more.

510
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,980
I know you want to whitewash the chamber

511
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,330
and make a clean business.

512
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,580
However, the past hatred

513
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,420
and the lost lives

514
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,640
can be paid so easily.

515
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,590
The Chamber is a big business.

516
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,990
I don't want Lanlan

517
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,410
to be engaged in such affairs

518
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,040
and go through ups and downs in her life.

519
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,860
-They're not questions.

520
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,280
I'll bring the business on track

521
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,740
in the shortest period of time.

522
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,690
-I believe in you,

523
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,270
however,

524
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,080
I'm worried about the Demon Sect.

525
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,180
To be frank,

526
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,300
your father's death

527
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,290
is the best alert.

528
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,340
-Xiao family?

529
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,150
-The troops in Xiao Xiguan that day

530
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,410
is sent by Mr. Xiao temporarily

531
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,290
from outside the city.

532
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,120
-He temporarily deployed the troops?

533
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,230
-The troops caught the master off guard.

534
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,810
I can't understand

535
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,390
why they stumbled into that.

536
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,240
-Alright, you could go back to have a rest.

537
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,520
-You too.

538
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,380
-You looks fresh and flushed,

539
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,220
you must had a big breakfast.

540
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,240
You should bring a breakfast for me.

541
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,590
Our master is still missing

542
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,890
and I have to do all the work.

543
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,540
I'm so tired.

544
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,560
-The troops that took away the Preacher

545
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,210
was sent by Xiao family.

546
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,350
-Are you sure?

547
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,360
-Yu Si told me that.

548
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,010
-A senior official of the government

549
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,600
sent troops to intervene in 
the affairs of local prisons,

550
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,370
just to execute

551
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,920
a special criminal

552
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,010
who has been jailed for 20 years.

553
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,910
We don't even have to think about it.

554
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,950
It's so strange.

555
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,920
When I went to Hu's home,

556
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,700
every time I talk about Little Immortal,

557
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,890
He behaves strangely.

558
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,840
The witch was absent-minded

559
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,470
after knowing I met Little Immortal.

560
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,360
Their generation

561
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,730
experienced the unrest,

562
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,210
so they must know the truth.

563
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,830
Do you know anyone

564
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,390
who experienced the unrest

565
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,020
and is obliging.

566
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,660
What's more, we can find him.
