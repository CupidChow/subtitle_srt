00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,310
Previously on

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,400
Tientsin Mystic.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,560
Guo Deyou sent the coffined baby corpses

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,660
back to the Xue's Mansion.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,880
Then he did his lighting-up trick again.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,000
He found something usual hiding behind Miss Xue's death.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,590
Xue Yuanyuan was about to be buried.

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,590
Guo, Ding, and Gu showed up and stopped the funeral.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,050
They revealed the reason of Xue Yuanyuan's death.

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,470
Xue Qingyang pleaded guilty.

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,180
Suddenly, the pall bearers ran out of the door carrying the coffin.

13
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,250
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying went after them.

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,500
Ding Mao stayed to question Xue Qingyang.

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,690
He was told that the baby was taken away

16
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,820
by a mysterious man before he was found dead.

17
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,630
Guo Deyou and Gu Ying couldn't catch them.

18
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,720
They only saw a dark-skinned man

19
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,070
jumped into the Hai River carrying Xue Yuanyuan's body.

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,540
Guo Deyou also jumped into the water to look for the body.

21
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,460
The body was tied on an iron door.

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,560
When the door was opened, about a hundred bodies came out.

23
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,970
The leads revealed that Miss Xiao was looking for Qian Zixian secretly.

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,250
Ding Mao blamed Hu Haijiang angrily.

25
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,740
Deyou!

26
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,080
You were right.

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,870
Yes. That's right.

28
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,850
Yeah.

29
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,970
Where are those bodies from?

30
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,550
That's so weird.

31
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,380
The Junior Tientsin found a door under the river.

32
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,329
Really?

33
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,270
The bodies just keep popping up.

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,630
So creepy.

35
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,410
Come on. Let's leave him here.

36
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,280
Come here.

37
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,050
Sit down. You smell like death.

38
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,550
Let me draw you a glyph to cast away the evil things.

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,810
Tieniu!

40
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,740
Yes.

41
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,630
You've been counting the number, right?

42
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,570
Yes.

43
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,110
Over a hundred for now.

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,650
Oh we'll be rich.

45
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,210
True.

46
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,050
What's up?

47
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,120
There... There must be over a hundred.

48
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,570
Fifty for each.

49
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,340
Bodies are piled up on the dock.

50
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,580
You'll need to pay more than five thousand.

51
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,870
Thanks.

52
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,010
All of the bodies emerged from the same place.

53
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,540
I thought there was only Xue Yuanyuan.

54
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,500
Why are there so many corpses?

55
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,630
Move away!

56
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,950
Give me a hand!

57
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,790
Alright!

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,120
Look at all this mess.

59
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,560
Nice to meet you here, Young Master.

60
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,500
I need more men.

61
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,000
First, protect the scene.

62
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,890
Then place several informants and start the investigation.

63
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,280
I also need you to get me

64
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,690
all the missing person reports in Tientsin.

65
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,710
All of them.

66
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,450
The disappearance of Xue Yuanyuan's body

67
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,590
brought us to over a hundred deaths.

68
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,020
I have to know what happened.

69
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,260
Yong Master, I do respect you.

70
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,980
But you are the heir of the water transportation here.

71
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,730
Not the heir of the police station.

72
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,810
I hope you can understand.

73
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,600
I'm the captain here.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,690
You should leave this to me.

75
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,310
I pulled the bodies from the river.

76
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,440
And I've been following Xue Yuanyuan's case.

77
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,620
Why don't you leave the case for me?

78
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Young Master.

79
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,190
The Junior Tientsin Mystic found the bodies.

80
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,740
Don't take credit for something you didn't do.

81
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,440
I paid him to do that.

82
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,650
In that case,

83
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,790
the corpse retrieval team is under the command of us.

84
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,180
And they are paid by us too.

85
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,030
Agent Ding,

86
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,680
you ignored the regulations and overstepped your bounds.

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,330
Even pay for yourself to investigate the case.

88
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,080
I can't help but wonder,

89
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,730
does your business have something to do

90
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,390
with Xue Yuanyuan's case?

91
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,560
Move!

92
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,610
They are from Ding's family.

93
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,340
Brother Yu.

94
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,430
Go.

95
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,030
Identify the bodies now.

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,070
This is the biggest dock of Tientsin.

97
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,390
Now it becomes the biggest

98
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,310
open-air morgue of Tientsin.

99
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,450
The River Worship Ceremony

100
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,010
has drawn a lot of attention.

101
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,380
And now this?

102
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,500
Supervisor Hu,

103
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,640
I think you owe me an explanation.

104
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,510
The job is not easy.

105
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,250
I'm surprised you are here in person.

106
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,900
There are dead bodies. It's my duty to be here.

107
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,380
I checked.

108
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,630
They were not our people.

109
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,150
No way.

110
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,540
The bodies piled up on your dock.

111
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,970
If they were not your people, who would they be?

112
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,500
Don't you dare pass the buck.

113
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,330
The case needs to be investigated thoroughly.

114
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,010
Captain Fu.

115
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,690
Though they were not our people,

116
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,130
they died in our place.

117
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,830
The chamber of commerce will allocate a special funding

118
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,820
to take the bodies

119
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,909
to the Mercy Hospital funded by us,

120
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,760
where they will be preserved to be claimed by their families.

121
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,310
I'll save you some trouble.

122
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,640
You can send your men back to rest.

123
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,950
We can handle it from here.

124
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,260
You really are a thoughtful man.

125
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,330
Perfect.

126
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,070
Yu Si.

127
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,350
Get things done.

128
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,470
Sure.

129
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,830
So hurry up to do the autopsy.

130
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,940
Make it look clean.

131
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,120
I bet you know that better than I do.

132
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Yu Si.

133
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,880
Give Captain Fu a ride.

134
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,750
Please.

135
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,880
Do it well.

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,650
If anything goes wrong,

137
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,030
we won't take the blame.

138
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,480
Don't worry. We won't make trouble for you.

139
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,650
They were all male strangers.

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,190
And they died at different times.

141
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,280
We are still working on that.

142
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,360
This is none of our business.

143
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,720
Let them handle it themselves.

144
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,600
But...

145
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,490
What?

146
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,590
Stay out of this.

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,980
This...

148
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,539
I don't think it's none of our business.

149
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,350
What do you mean?

150
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
Look at this.

151
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,100
Come in.

152
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,510
San Ye.

153
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,300
Captain Fu.

154
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,780
What brought you here?

155
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,290
I'm here to pay you a visit in person.

156
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,540
Such a nice office!

157
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,230
Are you busy?

158
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,610
Not that busy.

159
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,040
Take a seat.

160
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,950
Is the Secretary General Xiao still hale and hearty?

161
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,780
He's fine.

162
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,580
And how's Miss Xiao doing?

163
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,870
Actually,

164
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,200
I've got nothing important to say.

165
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,140
I just want to know something about Mr. Qian.

166
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,270
Did you hear something about him?

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,740
Yes.

168
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,710
But...

169
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,580
Just tell me what you know.

170
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,480
Please have a look.

171
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,860
Does this belong to Mr. Qian?

172
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,100
Where is he?

173
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,890
Over a hundred bodies were retrieved from the water near the dock.

174
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,700
I mean... Corpses.

175
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,580
I went there myself.

176
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,450
And I was the first one who found this pocket watch.

177
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,550
The corpses are preserved in the Mercy Hospital now.

178
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,840
Of course, a lot of them look alike.

179
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,260
It's hard to tell.

180
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,650
Do you want me to take you to identify the body?

181
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,450
It's for you.

182
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,100
What's this supposed to mean?

183
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,680
I can't take it.

184
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,150
I've been thinking about

185
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,380
what Miss Xiao asked me to do.

186
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,230
Keep it a secret.

187
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,610
Especially don't let Miss Xiao know.

188
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,880
I'll handle it.

189
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,600
Don't worry. I've already done that.

190
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,510
My men are under my commands.

191
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,270
And if there's any chance,

192
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,410
please let Secretary General Xiao know...

193
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,430
Captain Fu.

194
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,660
You've done enough.

195
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm glad I could help.

196
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,750
I'll talk to you later.

197
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Sure.

198
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,260
You may leave now.

199
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,100
Of course, I...

200
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,300
I'll leave you to your work.

201
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,130
Birth means creation.

202
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,260
Life is created after birth.

203
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,400
Birth and life.

204
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,210
There's an original life that can create all the other lives.

205
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,510
That's interesting.

206
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,390
The Holy Child is the original life of our Demon Sect.

207
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,530
Although it's found now,

208
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,580
it's dead for a long time.

209
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,130
Even this is the Holy Child,

210
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,810
we can't use it anymore.

211
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,220
What a shame.

212
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,370
We are still haunted by Ding Yiqiu.

213
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,080
The father is dead.

214
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,960
Then the son got involved.

215
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,660
He's now an agent of the police station.

216
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,760
Let him do his work.

217
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,490
And we'll make him pay if he stands out.

218
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,450
Be careful of Guo Deyou.

219
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,130
He isn't someone easy to deal with.

220
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,160
And he helped a lot

221
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,340
with Xue Yuanyuan's case.

222
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
What about the Senior Tientsin Mystic?

223
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,460
He didn't even show up at Ding Yiqiu's funeral.

224
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,870
Always choose to keep a low profile.

225
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,930
He has his own goal.

226
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,020
Never gets involved in other people's business.

227
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,470
Maybe we should create a new Holy Child.

228
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,260
There's no time.

229
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,740
Three children survived back then.

230
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,930
And the Holy Child is among them.

231
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
We don't have time to creat a new one.

232
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,370
So we have to find the old one.

233
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,680
Go check to see who had adopted a child at that time.

234
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,700
As for the Chamber of Commerce,

235
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,610
if they are bold enough,

236
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,590
Let them enjoy themselves

237
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,920
No problem

238
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,570
I've got things arranged on the dock

239
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,580
Just wait and see

240
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,350
May all go well

241
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,320
Let's continue

242
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,330
Who's next

243
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,270
My turn my turn

244
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,720
I'll go

245
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,920
Trionyx sinensis

246
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,820
Yellow croaker

247
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,680
Turtoise

248
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,810
It's the same thing with trionyx sinensis

249
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,720
Drink

250
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,530
Tortoise is turtle

251
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,690
How could it be the same with trionyx sinensis

252
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,640
Turtle appears different

253
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,250
With the tortoise

254
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,540
Tortoise looks the same with trionyx sinensis

255
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,560
What about Xuanwu tortoise

256
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
What kind does it belong

257
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,120
Stop messing around

258
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,520
Eat your meal

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,280
The shrimp head is good for your brain

260
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,090
Exactly what you two lack

261
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,350
Young Master Guo

262
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,250
About the tortoise statue from the river

263
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,640
Don't you think it's weird

264
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
There were over 100 dead bodies a night

265
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,940
You felt nothing about them

266
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,160
But wouldn't stop talking about the tortoise statue

267
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,980
The tortoise is the water mystic

268
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,640
The tortoise statue guards the safety of the waters

269
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,220
But the statue we found

270
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,410
Sunk in the bottom with a dead body tied

271
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,920
Isn't it just scary

272
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,600
You see I'm not the only one who freaks out

273
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,730
Shut up

274
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,610
How scary can it be while it's dead

275
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,660
It can't come to life again and bite you right

276
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,570
Just eat

277
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,480
Tieniu

278
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,750
You said that setting the tortoise statue

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,860
Was for the sake of safety for a place

280
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,110
Then where do they usually set it

281
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,290
Of course where the water's not safe

282
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,810
Where's it then

283
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,210
Where it flooded

284
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,280
Tientsin locates at the downstream of nine rivers

285
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,540
The waters here are complicated

286
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,000
Lots of villages are on the bank of rivers

287
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,740
Flood is very likely to occur here

288
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,460
We are not afraid of normal floods

289
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,839
We make our livings by water anyways

290
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,790
We're prepared

291
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,900
But if something really horrible happens

292
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,220
Like a flood drowning the whole village

293
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,430
Washing out houses

294
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,750
And causing casualties

295
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,910
The residents would ask witches to hold rites

296
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,140
If necessary

297
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,490
They'll set up a tortoise statue on the river bank

298
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,490
So as to guard the restless water

299
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,630
Hey Ding Mao

300
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,690
Drink with me

301
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,420
You are having hotpot

302
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,030
Can you really eat

303
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,260
Why not

304
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,820
We've had a long day retrieving dead bodies

305
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,520
Why are you so happy seeing so many dead people

306
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,850
The more people die on the river the more we earn

307
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,830
Of course we are happy

308
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,290
That's right

309
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,320
Happy

310
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,980
Come and drink

311
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,810
Makes sense

312
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,000
Eat

313
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,090
Let's eat

314
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,210
Have some more

315
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,750
Stir it yourself

316
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,750
Master

317
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,840
Have you seen so many dead bodies one night before

318
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,580
Not only for one night

319
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,170
I've never seen so many in a year

320
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,820
Over 100 dead bodies appeared together

321
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,450
I think somebody's up to something big

322
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,790
If 100 pork knuckles were brought to you

323
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,620
You'll also feel strange

324
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,600
Speaking of 100 pork knuckles

325
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,730
I mean dead bodies

326
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,890
I feel like someone put them there

327
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,060
On purpose

328
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,190
What we do for a living is to retrieve bodies

329
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,510
We don't need to care about other things

330
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,610
You see

331
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,160
First we retrieved the dead infant and Ding Yiqiu

332
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,610
And following the track of the dead infant

333
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,180
We found Xue Yuanyuan's body

334
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,500
All of a sudden someone came to steal her body

335
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,630
And following the clues

336
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,130
We found so many dead bodies

337
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,410
Why is this case so odd

338
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,650
Feels like everything's connected

339
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,750
All these cases are related to water

340
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,780
Stop

341
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,780
I said don't think too much

342
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,080
But you've started analyzing

343
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,820
As long as you do your own job

344
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,840
The case can be left to the police

345
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,670
They'll do their job too

346
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,890
The police won't do nothing

347
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,710
Ding Mao is even a special detective

348
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,560
He only locked himself in the room back from the dock

349
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,620
Can't count on him for anything

350
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,580
Coward

351
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,250
He's preoccupied take care of him

352
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,530
You both learn from me

353
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,200
One mountain can't accommodate two tigers

354
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,610
One river can't accommodate two dragons either

355
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,550
You call yourself a dragon

356
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,710
You are no more than a tortoise

357
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,800
A tortoise that's apprenticed to you

358
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,580
Not to mention the tortoise is the Tientsin Mystic

359
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,240
You don't listen to me

360
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,460
Even call yourself Tientsin Mystic

361
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,280
You

362
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,240
Master

363
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,640
Speaking of the tortoise

364
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,580
The tortoise statue in the water

365
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,270
Do you know where it came from

366
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,050
Never saw it before no clue

367
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,270
Enjoy your bath

368
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,190
Come out to help once you're done

369
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,220
President

370
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,580
Have a seat

371
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,940
Print an extra quickly

372
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,980
Which is about

373
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,660
A pandemic was caused by the dead bodies retrieved

374
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,410
The whole charity hospital has been quarantined

375
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,450
The body claiming has to be delayed

376
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,170
Till the pandemic gets under control

377
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,850
But we just retrieved the bodies

378
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,720
How can the pandemic outbreaks so fast

379
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,000
The hospital's telegram just arrived

380
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,800
Don't worry

381
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,450
I'll take care of it here

382
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,770
Please wait a moment

383
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,750
I'll go check right now

384
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,990
What do you want to check

385
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,150
The situation is very urgent

386
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,590
Write and print it out right now

387
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,220
Don't let the public come near

388
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,750
No delay is allowed

389
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,790
But I don't know about the situation at all

390
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,880
How can I report it

391
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
Also the irresponsible report printed

392
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,730
will lead to social panic

393
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,080
It's going to affect their lives

394
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,400
I've been in the office all day

395
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,560
But I didn't hear about the hospital's telegram

396
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,020
There should also be a pandemic certificate

397
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,790
I need to see it

398
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,600
Go out

399
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,850
What

400
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,910
I don't need you on this report anymore

401
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,520
You can go take a rest Miss Xiao

402
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,510
President

403
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,480
Tell Zhe I want to see him

404
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,810
Excuse me

405
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,060
I'm looking for Ding Mao he lives here right

406
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,630
Please come in

407
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,210
He's not in a good mood these days

408
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,360
I'm not sure he'll let you in

409
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,010
Why's a Buddha head here

410
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,990
It's been here as far back as I can remember

411
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,140
Where's the body of it

412
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,860
It rolled down the mountain

413
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,040
And only the head was left

414
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,390
It broke the wall as well

415
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Master said

416
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,470
With the Buddha head here our wish would come true

417
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,790
What happened next

418
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,820
Then the stream of pilgrims in this temple ended

419
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,100
It became Yizhuang

420
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,800
Over 100 dead bodies were retrieved from the Hai River

421
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,600
You must heard of it Young Master Ding

422
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,270
I was there on site

423
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,430
I heard once the bodies were sent

424
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,250
Into the charity hospital

425
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,820
A pandemic suddenly outbroke

426
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,920
Do you find there's something stange

427
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,920
about these dead bodies

428
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,200
Except for the large number of them

429
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,000
I didn't find anything different

430
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,980
from normal bodies

431
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,360
But I haven't carried out autopsy yet

432
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,220
So I can't say exactly

433
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,580
Dead bodies

434
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,280
They were immediately locked in the charity hospital

435
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Do you think there's some inside story here

436
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,400
Inside story

437
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,750
What inside story

438
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,890
That's my question for you Young Master Ding

439
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,450
In fact

440
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,690
I've been banned from inspecting this case

441
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,650
Then the problem is even more serious

442
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,470
Why are you so interested in this case

443
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,390
Miss Xiao

444
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,470
I was there at the Worship Ceremony

445
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,990
I saw what happened to your father

446
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,490
While your father's case hasn't been solved

447
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,680
Over 100 dead bodies showed themselves

448
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,690
The truth hasn't been revealed yet

449
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,180
But you lock yourself in this room

450
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,480
Do you mean to give up

451
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,760
What do you mean

452
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,720
I'm not only a bystander

453
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,590
Maybe just like you

454
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
I've got someone close to me related to this case

455
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,940
Someone close to you

456
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,890
Qian Zixian

457
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,820
Young Master Qian

458
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,960
He's been missing for a long time

459
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,620
I have a feeling that his body is in there

460
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,730
You think too much Miss Xiao

461
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,420
Young Master Ding

462
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,770
Can you please take me into the hospital

463
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,270
I told you just now

464
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,250
The police office has banned me from interfering

465
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,210
On this case

466
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,380
So it's a little bit difficult

467
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,060
If you want to get in

468
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,020
The charity hospital belongs to

469
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,010
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

470
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,030
Why does the Chamber hide the truth

471
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,520
of this case

472
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,940
Aren't you curious too

473
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,340
It won't be difficult for you to get in

474
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,200
Please I beg you

475
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,300
I'll try my best

476
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,270
Thank you

477
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,420
Do you know why I asked you to come

478
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,140
You are such a busy man

479
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,450
How would I know

480
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,230
Once you jumped into the water

481
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,210
The dead bodies came up floating

482
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,290
Do you know you are a suspect

483
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,350
I'm already doing you a favor not to arrest you

484
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,300
Sit straight

485
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,790
Look at your ugly posture

486
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,600
Fu

487
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,110
Don't be sarcastic

488
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,220
Do you think I really want to show up

489
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,180
I just want to get my share of earnings

490
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,250
I don't care about other things

491
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,760
Not one bit

492
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,250
But the number is too big

493
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,310
How do you want me to report

494
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,350
Just as the fact

495
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,710
I retrieve the bodies and count them

496
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,080
Don't you think about shrinking the number

497
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,430
I'll pay you according to the real number

498
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,050
But after I've paid you off

499
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,180
The dead bodies are none of your business anymore

500
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,940
No matter there are 100 or 1000 of them

501
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,590
Stay out of it

502
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,050
I'll remember what you did for me ok

503
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,970
Captain Fu do you know Xiao Lanlan the reporter

504
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,640
Reporter Xiao

505
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,570
I know her why

506
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,650
Fu Laiyong, famous Tientsin detective and police captain

507
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,820
Patrolled at late night tirelessly

508
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,980
And found over 100 dead bodies on the Caoyun dock

509
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,470
It was a marvelous contribution

510
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,170
He led a team himself to investigate the case

511
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,570
Committed to finding out the truth

512
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,990
To bring peace back to Tientsin

513
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,550
Let the Tientsin people live and work happily

514
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,620
Committed to finding out the truth

515
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,890
Have you written it all down

516
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,910
To bring what back to Tientsin

517
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,870
As soon as this commendatory letter goes on newspaper

518
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,450
The case has nothing to do with me

519
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,610
It's your own contribution

520
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,840
Xia Mohai

521
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,980
Get the Junior Tientsin Mystic's bill for him

522
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,200
Pay him off

523
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,210
Generous

524
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,200
You said to bring what back to Tientsin

525
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,920
The famous detective of Tientsin Fu Laiyong

526
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,620
Step aside

527
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,670
The hospital's not open

528
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,770
Do you know who I am

529
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,860
Young Master

530
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,220
Three fatal orders from the Chamber the police and hospital

531
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,000
No one gets inside

532
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,560
All three places are relevant to me

533
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,890
I'm from the Chamber

534
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,670
The hospital belongs to the Chamber

535
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,790
And I'm the detective of the police office

536
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,290
Why can't I get in

537
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,280
Don't push us Young Master

538
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,630
Either you chop our heads off

539
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,990
Or please go back

540
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,360
Young Master

541
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,940
We'll think of some way else

542
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:15,070
I told you we need to push this

543
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,320
You don't enjoy your stay at the Temple anymore

544
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,590
Yu Si I want to talk to Uncle Hu for a while

545
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,040
Tell the kitchen to cook some dishes for Young Master

546
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,230
Got it

547
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,600
Still hiding the truth

548
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,430
What happened

549
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,160
Tell me about it

550
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,590
Why did you lock the dead bodies

551
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,090
You were there too Young Master

552
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,610
You know what happened

553
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,790
No I don't

554
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,350
The only thing I know is over 100 people died on the Chamber dock

555
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,180
Do you know what they say

556
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,540
They said we did something wicked to cause this

557
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,210
If you take in everything

558
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,820
Others talk about us

559
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,270
The Chamber can't do anything

560
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,640
You have to give me an explanation

561
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,100
Who dares to give an assertion right now

562
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,550
We can only know how serious the pandemic is

563
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,370
until the German virus experts arrive

564
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,560
and check the situation

565
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,560
To give a conclusion

566
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,950
If we spread the information

567
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,440
Let the reporters make a fuss about this

568
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,220
The public will get in panic

569
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,910
This is not problem-solving

570
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,510
But rather trouble-making

571
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,750
Then can you solve the problem from hiding facts

572
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,220
Better safe than sorry

573
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,970
It's cautiousness and prudence

574
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,180
That makes the Chamber what it is today

575
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,420
Not impulsion or recklessness

576
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,450
Then let me ask you

577
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,610
I'm a forensic doctor

578
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,880
Also the insider of the Chamber

579
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,950
Why can't I go to the hospital

580
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,450
You went to the hospital

581
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,490
Young Master my duty now

582
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,570
Is to guard the safety of your living

583
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,280
If anything bad happens to you

584
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,990
How can I face your father

585
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,360
If the virus spreads out

586
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,350
And expands its infection

587
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,280
The Chamber is doomed

588
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,400
Is it that the Chamber

589
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,200
has something to do with Xue Yuanyuan's case

590
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,420
What else is hidden?

591
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,840
This charity hospital is owned by

592
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,000
your Caoyun Chamber of Commerce.

593
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,430
Why are you trying to

594
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,860
cover up this case?

595
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,460
Except for being a limp,

596
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,170
does he have any other characteristics?

597
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,420
I don't know his accent.

598
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,340
He is not an acquaintance.

599
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,460
I heard him coughing all the time.

600
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,610
Go away.

601
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,030
When my father died, you didn't want me to look into it.

602
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,170
Now over a hundred people died, you want to keep me out of it again.

603
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,170
What do you want me to do?

604
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,130
What's my job in Chamber of Commerce?

605
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,520
Gobbling food and waiting to die?

606
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,530
Nonsense.

607
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,450
Young Master, Young Master.

608
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,920
When is the shift change?

609
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,830
I don't know.

610
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,200
Tired and hot,

611
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,780
my feet are numb already.

612
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,020
Time to change.

613
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,570
Okay.Go.

614
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,420
Go back and rest.

615
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,730
I'm coming in.

616
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,860
Left some sheep bone for you.

617
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,570
Take a bite if you feel hungry.

618
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,810
Hey,

619
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,060
Why I rolled around in the dirt?

620
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:11,470
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce is right there for me to to inherit,

621
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,700
but I refuse.

622
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,330
Instead I chose to study  forensics,

623
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,970
and learn nothing finnally.

624
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,280
I came here to worship

625
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,790
and lived in  this fucking place.

626
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,650
The last time I saw my dad,

627
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,240
I had a terrible fight with him.

628
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,340
To find out his cause of death,

629
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,730
I struggled to be a fake police.

630
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,240
Fatalities happened one after another.

631
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,890
And it turned out that

632
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,900
over a hundred  corpses

633
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,680
were hidden in hospital owned by Caoyun Chamber of Commerce.

634
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,700
It's my family's hospital

635
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,650
but I was not allowed to enter.

636
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,630
I don't know whether I should continue to check.

637
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm supposed to just salvage  bodies and get my pay.

638
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,540
But I can't stand a man

639
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,580
acting like a coward.

640
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,240
For this case, I will be designed to accompany you to investigate it to the end.

641
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,580
I'm scared.

642
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,270
I'm afraid that if I continue to investigate this,

643
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,540
I may find that my father is completely different

644
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,540
from my imagination.

645
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,990
Caoyun Chamber of Commerce

646
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,450
also hides too many secrets I should not know.

647
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,380
Whether you are afraid or not,

648
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,500
you should at least know the truth.

649
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,060
Little witch coming for meals again.

650
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,680
Bullshit! That's our  older sister-in-law in the future.

651
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,960
Come, come,come. Have a drink.

652
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,020
Yes,  go.

653
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,410
Hey,sister-in-law, let's have a drink.

654
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,540
I have a plan to send you to the hospital.

655
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,940
Come on. Let's drink.

656
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,370
Sweet talker.

657
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,220
Pour it on.

658
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,100
You are coming down from the mountain.

659
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,360
I know it.

660
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,450
You will have soldiers to help you yell to clear road.

661
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,280
Don't make any noise or belles.

662
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,760
Power in hand and  strength in hand.

663
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,920
With power and stength,

664
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,010
we can beat the drum right away,

665
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,880
all issues will be solved soon.

666
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,850
Whose right? Whose fault?

667
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,620
That's who's taking the blame.

668
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:35,380
Saving lives with compassion.

669
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,190
Mom,

670
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,780
Where are we going?

671
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,679
Wanna eat Pork Elbow, let's go to Shun Fu Towner.

672
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,850
Shun Fu Towner.Shun Fu Towner.

673
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,120
Shun Fu Towner.

674
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,910
Why are you carrying my mussels mud?

675
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,670
Mom, what are you doing?

676
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,270
That is what I use to drive away evil spirits. You know that.

677
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,440
I was there the day when they  salvaged bodies.

678
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,170
You think I don't know that.

679
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,040
I want to investigate cases together with Deyou.

680
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,400
You still dare to mention him to me.Stupid  girl.

681
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,920
You...

682
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,890
Guo Deyou is a catastrophe.

683
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,560
So many corpses!

684
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,430
Don't you know it may bring bad lcuk?

685
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,180
Let me exorcise bad luck for you.

686
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,920
Let me exorcise bad luck for you.

687
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,450
Bad luck goes away.

688
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,420
Bad luck goes away.Bad luck goes away.

689
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,860
Don't be so angry.

690
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,970
You stupid girl,

691
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,630
you are not allowed to play with Guo Deyou.

692
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,310
Stop!

693
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,060
Here are another three bodies right from the river

694
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,000
Still from the same old place as last time. There may be a gap.

695
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,600
Our boss ordered us to send it here quickly.

696
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,870
The hospital has been locked down and no one is allowed in.

697
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,200
Come on, sir. The epidemic is raging now.

698
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,140
If you don't let me in,

699
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,200
where can I send these three bodies?

700
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,250
Take a look, sir.

701
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,060
Look at it yourself. Look.

702
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,940
This is... is way too fucking rotten.

703
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,070
All right, all right, hurry up and send it in.

704
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,320
When you walk in, ask people inside

705
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,470
where the morgue is.

706
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,580
Put it down  and come out right away.

707
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,400
Understand?

708
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,250
Yes, sir.

709
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,360
Come.

710
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,520
Okay.

711
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,960
Why did your hand touch just now?

712
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,810
Where did my hand touch?

713
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,950
We were all crammed inside，

714
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,220
where can I put my hand?

715
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,630
It's okay, little witch.

716
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,200
The girls like you, nobody wants to take advantage of you.

717
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,740
Do you believe that I can slice you to pieces to put in hot pot?

718
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,620
Tieniu's meat is too old.

719
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,270
Mudfish would be the better choice, so tender and fresh.

720
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,570
Okay, you two are done. Just go.

721
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,430
Sure.

722
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,360
Wait.

723
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,570
Take off your clothes.

724
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,040
Hurry up.

725
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,330
Let's go first. Be careful.

726
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,200
Got it. Leave now.

727
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,240
Come on.

728
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,350
It's clear here.

729
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,190
Copy that.

730
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,710
Learn me

731
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,540
your messy and strange  props.

732
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,230
What's for?

733
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,500
Unlock.

734
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,410
This is my surgical tool and you use to open locks?

735
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,120
What are the surgical tools used for?

736
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:34,900
Do an autopsy.

737
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,690
Then is that true

738
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,930
we come here to do an autopsy?

739
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,810
Yes.

740
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,920
Isn't that the same thing?

741
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,680
Give it to me.

742
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,730
Break, break it up!

743
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,210
What if you break it?

744
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,450
Besides, do you know how to open the lock?

745
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,050
Not knowing this little trick,

746
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,790
how to adventure in this world?

747
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,520
That won't work either.

748
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,210
These are sterile.

749
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,470
It has been heavily guarded outside.

750
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,790
How can those lazy people lock up at any time?

751
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,040
Not knowing this little trick,

752
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,480
how to adventure in this world?
