[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,070
So the story goes on.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,230
Previously,

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,350
Guo and Ding knew the feud between

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,190
Secretary-general Xiao and the 3 old Guos from the witch.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,510
She told them that

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,149
Little Immortal was a danger.

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,150
Lian Huaqing and Xiao San confronted each other.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,990
The Preacher hasn't been executed.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,630
He was secretly imprisoned by Xiao San

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,030
as a bargaining chip in talks with Lian.

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,150
Ding Mao and Xiao Lanlan was talking at the quay.

13
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,910
While Ding was trying to sound out the Xiao Family,

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,430
he was suddenly attacked.

15
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,310
In order to draw Xiao San forth,

16
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,270
Lian claimed that he had found Little Immortal,

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,270
and tricked Xiao into checking in a flurry.

18
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,270
Seizing the opportunity,

19
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,430
Lian followed Xiao to the prison.

20
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,910
Lian and the Preacher finally met each other.

21
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,750
Little Immortal promised he would find the Holy Child.

22
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,950
Xiao Lanlan's father was informed that

23
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,670
the one who deployed forces when the riot broke out

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,790
in the prison was Xiao San.

25
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,270
Xiao Lanlan told Ding Mao that

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,030
Little Immortal was still alive.

27
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,110
In the Dragon King Temple,

28
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,470
Guo Deyou found an opera ticket on

29
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,910
Gu Ying's Spirit-dispelling Whip.

30
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,510
Meanwhile,

31
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,870
Gu Ying was wandering on the street, spaced out.

32
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,670
That leads the story to...

33
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,750
Xiao San fell ill. Guo Deyou kept an apppointment.

34
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,110
He visited Xiao's mansion for the general drawing.

35
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,550
The Tientsin Mystic was fighting against the demon.

36
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,910
The lives of Guo Deyou and Gu Ying were at stake.

37
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:32,710
♫Jiang Wei said, "You may show your reverence♫

38
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:40,790
♫and your loyalty to the heaven."♫

39

50
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,750
Bravo! Bravo!

51
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,350
Thank you, sir!

52
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,990
Thank you, sir!

53
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,510
Thanks. Thank you, sir!

54
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,910
Thank you, sir!

55
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,430
Thank you, sir!

56
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,590
Sure enough, you keep your word.

57
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,430
How interesting your magic is!

58
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,990
It's not magic. It's

59
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,230
knowledge in here.

60
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,110
You know only a little about western hypnotism

61
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,190
and you think you're a god?

62
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,150
I dare not.

63
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,350
The world is full of mysteries.

64
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,590
Only those who are ignorant are fearless.

65
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,190
Your capability

66
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,150
really deserves the reputations.

67
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,070
I don't have any reputation.

68
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,030
Only few people know about me.

69
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,230
Unlike you, the well-known Junior Tientsin Mystic.

70
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,550
I heard the sound of metal

71
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,950
in the Bangzi Opera just now.

72
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,590
Good hearing.

73
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,990
The sound of the dual clapper

74
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,590
must be the signal of the hypnotism.

75
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,750
Savvy!

76
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,990
It's collective hypnotism.

77
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,870
I just adopted the point-to-area method.

78
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,350
I focused on a core,

79
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,270
and used his lyrics and singing voice

80
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,950
to deliver my hypnotic information.

81
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,070
You mean

82
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,350
you put the hypnotic information

83
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,670
into the drum performance?

84
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,870
What play is it today?

85
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,390
The Han Dynasty was dying,

86
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,150
and the martial talent failed to deploy forces.

87
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,790
Seven Star Lamp.

88
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,909
The martial talent Zhuge Liang

89
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,150
was a genius,

90
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,590
but he still should surrender to his fate.

91
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,070
There's altar setting and drum beating in Seven Star Lamp.

92
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,110
It's just right.

93
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,990
So it's still magic.

94
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,270
It can only affect those unguarded.

95
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,350
Look, I'm not affected

96
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,830
by your magic now.

97
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,630
Really?

98
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,110
Where's Gu Ying?

99
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,550
She is where she's supposed to be.

100
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,470
She is needed in some places.

101
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,230
It will be a waste if she stays in this

102
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,870
filthy place.

103
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,669
What the heck are you going to do?

104
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,950
Now that I'm standing onstage

105
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,510
with my beloved audience

106
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,710
standing offstage,

107
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,710
I might as well tell a story

108
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,430
since I can't perform drum singing.

109
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,550
Twenty years ago,

110
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,670
there was a flood in Tientsin.

111
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,310
The flood left numerous victims.

112
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,830
In the eyes of government officials,

113
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,310
Qiming Village was just an ant nest.

114
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,350
Ants getting drown was not a big deal for them.

115
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,110
And the god was so unmerciful to them.

116
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,230
They came down with a weird disease.

117
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,150
Their veins were bulging. It was painful.

118
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,310
And there was no cure,

119
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,190
so they could only be tortured to death.

120
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,790
Later they found that

121
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,670
opium could ease their pain,

122
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,310
but it was only a palliative.

123
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,030
So they must find a

124
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,510
radical cure for this disease.

125
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,110
People who were hopeless and

126
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,030
desperate to survive

127
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,030
were the original Demon Sect.

128
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,790
The weird disease was spreading quickly,

129
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,990
and the Demon Sect was growing big.

130
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,470
Faith brought them hope.

131
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,310
In the Demon Sect,

132
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,870
there was a new-born baby

133
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,150
who was immune to the disease.

134
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,510
And his blood

135
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,710
could also serve as a radical cure.

136
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,430
The Demon Sect called him the Holy Child.

137
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,350
But how could the blood of a baby

138
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,510
cure tens of thousands of victims?

139
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,310
In order to save the world,

140
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,670
the Demon Sect had to seek for new Holy Children.

141
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,270
But Holy Child was

142
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,150
one in a million.

143
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,630
It's just killing children to save themselves.

144
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,950
Don't try to whitewash it.

145
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,230
Without small sacrifice,

146
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,310
there will be no massive liberation.

147
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,430
Without the Demon Sect,

148
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,190
Tientsin would be a ghost town now.

149
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,150
Twenty years ago, the Demon Sect plundered children

150
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,070
and got Tientsin into a panic.

151
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,150
It was the Demon Sect that

152
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,310
turned Tientsin into a ghost town.

153
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,750
In order to find out the Holy Child,

154
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,550
we had no other choice.

155
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,910
There were three children surviving,

156
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,750
so one of them was the Holy Child.

157
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,110
But Ding Yiqiu, Hu Haijiang

158
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,910
and Guo Chun

159
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,350
appeared just at the perfect time.

160
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,830
Why are you telling me these?

161
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,870
I don't care.

162
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,870
You will soon find that

163
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,310
what you care the most is

164
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,430
who the real Holy Child is.

165
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,630
What the heck are you trying to say?

166
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,590
The three surviving children...

167
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,830
Guo Chun took one of them.

168
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,830
Guess who he took?

169
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,830
The water floods over the metal bucket.

170
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,030
A centipede curls its tail to form a golden hook.

171
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,630
The beauty is sleeping soundly.

172
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,430
Weal or woe depends on human effort.

173
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,070
Where's Gu Ying?

174
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,230
I'll wait for you.

175
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,510
I'm sorry, sir. Sorry.

176
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,150
Sorry. Sorry.

177
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,110
Here he is!

178
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,670
Where have you been?

179
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,550
I've been looking for you.

180
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,070
I'm telling you.

181
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,030
My deduction is absolutely right.

182
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,150
There's something wrong with Xiao San.

183
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,150
And Little Immortal is still alive.

184
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,870
I know.

185
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,110
I just met him.

186
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,590
What?

187
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,750
Are you OK?

188
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,430
What did he say?

189
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,230
You're not hypnotized, are you?

190
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,550
Little Immortal is such a danger.

191
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,910
We need to make a plan.

192
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,990
Hey, I'm talking to you.

193
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,750
Where is Gu Ying?

194
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,550
Tell me!

195
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,990
What?

196
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,910
Where is Gu Ying?

197
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,110
Of the three babies who survived,

198
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,310
two were taken away by Guo Chun.

199
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,550
Who do you think they are?

200
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,350
Lian Huaqing!

201
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,270
As long as you find the Preacher

202
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,310
to tell me where the Holy Child is,

203
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,310
I'll certainly take those worms

204
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,630
out of your body

205
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,630
as I promised you before.

206
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,270
Considering that you have done so much

207
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,870
for my Mo Gu Dao,

208
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,430
I must make you officially recognized.

209
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,390
No,

210
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,350
I won't drink that！

211
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,270
Damn you, Lian Huaqing!

212
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,430
I promised to take those worms out of your body,

213
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,630
but it doesn't mean I'll take all of them out.

214
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,910
I can't wait to see

215
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,510
what magic will be created

216
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,190
when those worms blend in

217
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,110
with the flowing blood of a living body.

218
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,230
Damn you, Lian Huaqing!

219
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,030
Welcome you to be one of Mo Gu Dao!

220
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,990
Shen Po!

221
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,390
How dare you come to me?

222
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,310
Where are you keeping my daughter?

223
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,790
If you don't bring Gu Ying to me today,

224
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,270
I assure you

225
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,710
I'll make you pay the price.

226
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,910
The Little Immortal is still alive,

227
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,950
and Gu Ying is kept by him now.

228
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,230
While I have decided

229
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,110
to let what's gone be gone,

230
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,710
there is still even more

231
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,230
letting me down.

232
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,310
All streams are going to flow into the ocean,

233
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,070
which can't be stopped by even the rivers and lakes.

234
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,150
Tide rises and water floods in the bucket.

235
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,870
A centipede curls its tail.

236
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,750
The beauty is deep in sleep.

237
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,990
It's the man that masters fortune.

238
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,630
What do these words mean?

239
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,550
Who told you these?

240
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,990
The Little Immortal.

241
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,390
They're related to the Fengshui Map
named "Jin Gou Yin Hua".

242
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,630
The time when Mo Gu Dao was wiped out,

243
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,470
a Fengshui Map was found.

244
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,310
It's said to be mapped 
by a mass of Fengshui Masters

245
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,390
for Mo Gu Dao's evil purposes.

246
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,110
Through this map,

247
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,270
the origin of Mo Gu Dao's Evil Water can be found.

248
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,470
The origin of Evil Water?

249
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,110
"Jin Gou Yin Hua" is the map's name,

250
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,510
while "a centipede curls its tail"

251
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,350
seems to be a certain way for figuring out
the hidden mystery in the map.

252
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,950
Why did the Little Immortal tell you these words?

253
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,830
What on earth does he want?

254
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,350
Time is limited,

255
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,910
Xian Gu, tell me where the map is now.

256
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,230
Let me think about it.

257
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,070
According to the old bastard's personality,

258
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,110
the map can very likely be kept by him.

259
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:51,670
Who?

260
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,990
Having heard of your name long before,

261
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,230
it's my honor to finally see you today,
Secretary General Xiao.

262
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,430
Me too.

263
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,150
I've long been looking forward to meeting you,
Junior Tientsin Mystic.

264
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,710
I'm just a nobody living on 
some water-related businesses,

265
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,830
and I've never imagined

266
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,510
I could have the privilege to talk with you,
Secretary General Xiao.

267
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,710
Guo Deyou, right？

268
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,510
Right, it's me.

269
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,830
Good, you've taken the surname of Guo Chun.

270
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,790
Lao Xiao, don't beat about the bush anymore,

271
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,790
let's get right to the point, where is the map?

272
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,990
If that map could save your daughter,

273
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,990
I would take it out without any hesitation.

274
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,990
But I don't understand

275
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,350
what the Junior Tientsin Mystic can do

276
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,870
for it?

277
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,390
I don't care whether there was something

278
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,270
between you and Mo Gu Dao

279
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,070
that you don't want to divulge to others,

280
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,390
nor do I want to know about it.

281
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,150
But if Mo Gu Dao

282
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,510
reaches its goal,

283
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,430
I believe

284
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,470
your status as the Secretary General

285
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,390
will be endangered.

286
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,830
Obviously, it's targeted at me for Mo Gu Dao

287
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,390
to take Gu Ying away this time.

288
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,830
I know you may don't like me,

289
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,910
but you must be disliking Mo Gu Dao more.

290
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,910
What is that saying?

291
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,110
About the relation between enemies and friends?

292
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,870
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

293
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,790
No matter how many people you send

294
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,430
to track Mo Gu Dao,

295
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,870
you can never get anything about Mo Gu Dao.

296
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,710
But if you have me as your bait,

297
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,350
you can get any great fish

298
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,350
as you like.

299
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,750
What are you talking about?

300
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,910
Don't you know that our Gu Ying's destiny

301
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,350
depends totally on him?

302
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,750
I've reserved this map

303
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,990
for twenty years.

304
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,670
I knew that it could be of great use

305
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,630
sooner or later.

306
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,070
Junior Tientsin Mystic,

307
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,910
what's your plan?

308
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,350
Let your men follow behind me,

309
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,310
and tell them no action is allowed

310
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,470
until Gu Ying escapes unscathed.

311
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,710
If Gu Ying gets hurt

312
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,670
for your being rash,

313
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,910
I'll let you pay the price, I swear to you！

314
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,030
Why should I trust you?

315
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,070
No matter for me,

316
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,390
for my  master,

317
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,630
or for you,

318
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,470
even for the whole Tianjin,

319
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,470
to get Mo Gu Dao wiped out

320
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,230
can be rather a blessing.

321
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,190
Tide rises and water floods in the bucket.

322
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,070
A centipede curls its tail.

323
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,470
The beauty is deep in sleep.

324
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,470
It's the man that masters fortune.

325
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,230
There're two elements of the nature,
Yin and Yang.

326
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,950
When they flow, they become wind;
when they rise to the sky, they become clouds.

327
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,510
And when they fall down, they become rain.

328
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,550
Tigers always keep themselves away from water,

329
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,710
snakes would escape from the spring thunder,

330
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,950
toads have been staying on the moon,

331
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,470
and a centipede curls its tail.

332
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,430
That's it.

333
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,510
What do you mean?

334
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,750
Worms with hundreds of feet

335
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,350
die without showing any rigor mortis.

336
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,110
As for "a centipede curls its tail",

337
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,470
it refers to the shape of the road.

338
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,950
According to all of these,

339
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,150
we can see  it forms the shape

340
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,070
of a centipede with hundreds of feet
 curling its tail

341
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,150
exactly at

342
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,910
this place！

343
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,190
Who are you?

344
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,790
It's not interesting at all.

345
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,030
Where am I?

346
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,590
Damn it, you just keep asking the same questions.

347
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,670
Why am I here?

348
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,950
People who just woke up from the hypnosis

349
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,510
would always ask at first

350
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,110
about where they are,

351
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,470
who you are,

352
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,590
and why I am here,

353
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,990
just as you do right now.

354
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,350
Let me go!

355
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,750
Do you think whether the person

356
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,630
coming to save you will be the Holy Child?

357
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,270
The Holy Child?

358
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,110
Tide rises and water floods in the bucket.

359
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,830
A centipede curls its tail.

360
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,270
The beauty is deep in sleep.

361
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,790
It's the man that masters fortune.

362
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,750
You are from Demon Sect?

363
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,630
The future of Demon Sect counts on the Holy Child.

364
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,870
And your future also possibly relies on the Holy Child.

365
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,630
These two totally different things

366
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,230
just get connected in this way.

367
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,110
Interesting.

368
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,910
Calm down.

369
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,190
If the Holy Child comes, it'll be even more interesting.

370
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,990
Don't go! Get me out of here!

371
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,830
Let me go…

372
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,870
Anyone there?

373
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,830
This plant is so huge.

374
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,230
How long will it take if we keep searching like this?

375
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,590
I don't have too much patience.

376
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,270
Once you see suspicious people,

377
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,510
shoot and kill them right away!

378
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,990
I've said, no one could move without my order!

379
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,750
Here we are,

380
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,790
and I'm the boss.

381
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,630
Anyone there?

382
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,230
Anyone there?

383
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,790
Help!

384
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,430
Help!

385
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,550
Help me!

386
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,310
Guo Deyou!

387
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,470
Guo Deyou! Help me!

388
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,470
Gu Ying?

389
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,950
Gu Ying! Gu Ying!

390
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,830
Finally you're here.

391
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,390
Open the door.

392
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,350
I say,

393
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,670
open the door!

394
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,030
To Demon Sect,

395
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,150
the Holy Child is like a key,

396
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,070
which can help it

397
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,230
open up a brand new world.

398
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,630
Shut up!

399
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,550
What happened to him?

400
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,790
What's wrong with him?

401
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,830
He looks so weird. Is he caught in the hallucination?

402
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,230
Gu Ying!

403
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,830
Gu Ying! Gu Ying!

404
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,790
Deyou!

405
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,909
Finally you're here.

406
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,830
Deyou! Help me!

407
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,110
Open the door.

408
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,190
I think you have already made a decision in your mind.

409
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,270
I say,

410
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,590
open the door!

411
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,630
Deyou, what are you doing?

412
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,470
To Demon Sect,

413
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,390
the Holy Child is like a key,

414
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,310
which can help it

415
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,910
open up a brand new world.

416
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,550
But the first priority now

417
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,830
is not to open the door

418
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,470
to save Demon Sect with this key,

419
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,190
but to

420
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,950
open the door of the Holy Child's heart

421
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,510
and let him walk into Demon Sect

422
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,350
with recognition of a totally new world.

423
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,510
Give me the key!

424
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,110
If I didn't get it wrong,

425
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,590
then my mission has already been completed.

426
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,510
And I'll leave the rest to Lian Huaqing

427
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,390
Shut up and give me the key!

428
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,030
Now let me see

429
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,110
if it's really you,

430
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,590
the Holy Child.

431
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,230
Shut up!

432
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,750
Deyou, what are you doing?

433
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,470
Deyou?

434
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,750
Why are you going down? Wake up!

435
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,390
Wake up, Deyou!

436
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,870
Deyou, what's wrong with you?

437
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,670
Wake up, Deyou!

438
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,990
Deyou…

439
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,670
Wake up! I'm here!

440
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,230
Can you hear me?

441
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,670
Deyou!

442
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,750
Deyou…

443
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,790
Deyou!

444
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,230
Deyou!
