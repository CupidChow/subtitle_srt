00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,360
Previously on

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,510
Tientsin Mystic

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,180
Guo Deyou fainted during cigarette-lighting to analyze grievances

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,230
Little Witch Gu Ying came to save him from the chaos

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,580
And subdued Ding Mao at the Chamber of Commerce

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,120
Guo Deyou explained the death of Ding Yiqiu

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,290
And with Ding Mao examining the body

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,420
They came to the same conclusion

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,360
that Ding Yiqiu died in the sea

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,710
Ding Mao got his detective identity from the police officee

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,940
Meaning to investigate Guo Deyou at the Dragon King Temple

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,430
But was stopped by Guo Chun

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,570
Someone sneaked into the Temple to steal the dead infant

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,320
Master Guo played his tricks

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,750
to grab the dead infant from the thief

17
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,870
Ding Mao was so impressed that

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,340
He moved to the Temple to be apprenticed to Master Guo

19
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,790
To find out the identity of the dead infant

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,510
Guo Deyou and Ding Mao went their separate ways

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,400
And this leads to this episode

22
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,260
Young Master Ding Investigates the Water Monkey case

23
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,150
Guo Deyou Tests Xue Qingyang

24
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,910
You've traveled everywhere

25
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,990
Come back to your hometown soon

26
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,560
The Empyreal Fairy

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,579
Has come to take your spirit back

28
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,600
Come back Luo Dahai

29
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,060
Luo Dahai Luo Dahai

30
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,140
Come back

31
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,140
Deyou

32
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,900
Mind your business

33
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,510
How did you know I'm here

34
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,810
I wouldn't have come if I knew

35
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,480
What was that

36
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,019
Where's your mother, is she drunk again

37
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,480
This is an easy one

38
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,620
She won't come even if she's sober

39
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,980
The householder here went out for a long time

40
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,010
His family feared he dies outside

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,100
And asked me to call his spirit back

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,240
This is a big deal

43
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,660
You should be more serious

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,520
Right

45
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,400
Deyou

46
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,830
After I'm done calling spirit

47
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,250
How about I treat you to pork knuckles at Dengying Mansion

48
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,360
Drop it

49
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,860
I paid the bill every time

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,180
I've got my wage this time

51
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,409
Trust me

52
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,640
No I won't

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
Guo Deyou Guo Deyou

54
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,570
Come back Guo Deyou

55
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,070
Guo Deyou

56
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,700
Master

57
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,080
Did you call the wrong name

58
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,290
No

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,659
Who's Guo Deyou then

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,660
Ying

61
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,910
Come with me

62
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,480
I'm not done here

63
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,540
Let's get pork knuckles

64
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:10,990
Not good enough

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,750
Bend your back more

66
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,490
Take smaller steps

67
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,930
You should look tired

68
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,410
A little bit upset in your eyes

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,880
Still a bit excited

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,790
Struggle

71
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,220
Do you understand struggle

72
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,590
It's a kind of sadness

73
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,340
That penetrates from outside to inside

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,170
while spread from inside to outside

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,260
It's a kind of family separation sadness

76
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,500
Just like you were holding in your hand

77
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,090
A hot, freshly steamed sweet potato

78
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,450
And you haven't even taken one bite

79
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,210
Before it dropped onto the ground

80
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,110
And then even got stepped on

81
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,430
That's the sadness you should be in

82
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,920
Act it out for me

83
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,430
You just want me to act like

84
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,500
I was just raped

85
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,260
I'll just protrude my belly

86
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,580
How can you say raped

87
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,990
There should be a new life in your belly

88
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,300
who is going to say goodbye to you

89
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,870
once he's born

90
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,370
But there's only a pancake in my belly

91
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,790
No baby

92
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,550
You said you would take me to have pork knuckles

93
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,850
Be serious ok

94
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,000
You wouldn't stop asking me to take you investigate

95
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,380
I took you here to the ghost market now

96
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,850
Don't drop the ball ok

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,909
How can you be so cruel

98
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,159
Me

99
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,170
Although I'm not a girl from an eminent family

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,020
or a pretty girl from a humble family

101
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,680
I know I'm not extremely beautiful

102
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,190
or be raised with high expectations

103
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,990
You may not think highly of me

104
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,170
But why did you rape me

105
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,730
R...rape

106
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,790
You only looked for the pleasure for a moment

107
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,230
Do you know how much I have to bear

108
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,750
It's your baby in my belly

109
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,830
And you are asking me to give it up now

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,910
How can you be so cruel

111
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,690
Too dramatic

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,120
I know you understand now

113
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,120
But can you please keep it down

114
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,340
You won't really do this to me will you

115
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,720
Take off your clothes

116
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,130
Here

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,110
Of course

118
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,390
But you said it's just acting

119
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,340
Why taking off the clothes

120
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,090
I was asking you to take off your robe and stuff it in

121
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,510
What are you thinking about

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,720
Is this really going to work

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,780
Look down

124
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,990
Don't gaze around

125
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,240
And don't answer anyone who talks to you

126
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,000
Those who work here at the ghost market

127
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,160
are not normal merchants

128
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,610
Are you sure we can do this Deyou

129
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,710
Cut it out

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,890
Hey may I ask something

131
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,150
May I ask something

132
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,560
This is good stuff

133
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,810
Look at the color, it's definitely top quality

134
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,460
I'll go first

135
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,960
The fate of parenting has not been fulfilled

136
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,740
He who believes in Buddhism won't get the eight sufferings

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,760
Accumulate merits and obey commandments

138
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,160
The Buddha will lead us to the sacred mountain of Yujing

139
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,730
Look out your shoes

140
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,700
What's your request

141
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
About pregnancy

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,820
All those who come to me

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,900
either seek for guidance and soul-comforting

144
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,400
or look for trouble

145
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,110
This girl pretends to be pregnant

146
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,980
while she's still a virgin

147
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,040
I don't want to get into trouble

148
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,470
You came to the wrong person

149
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,350
Please go back

150
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,150
We didn't come to bring you trouble

151
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,680
But to give you money

152
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,840
This is about the Young Lady of our Mansion

153
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,020
She doesn't want to show up now

154
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,180
So she sent us to ask first

155
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,080
If things go well

156
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,780
She'll come here herself

157
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,070
Although I'm blind in one eye

158
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,560
I've got my other eye very clear

159
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,940
To tell the truth

160
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,220
We just want to check your skills

161
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,400
Wenpo

162
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,730
You only need to tell us

163
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,320
Who came to you for delivery recently

164
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,450
And then we'll go check

165
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,390
If the mothers and babies are all safe

166
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,420
If everything is fine

167
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,110
We'll trust you with her delivery

168
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,840
The ghost market is a dark place

169
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,050
Those who come here each has their own suffering

170
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,020
How could I expose my clients' information

171
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,150
I'll only do it if you trust me

172
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,910
Otherwise you can go find others

173
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,900
Hold on

174
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,970
The Tientsin Mystic guides the way and doesn't explain

175
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,300
The matter here can be great or small

176
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,960
I'll draw a magic figure to see this place

177
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
Maybe there's nothing special

178
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,190
I won't interrupt your business

179
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,580
But if you won't let me

180
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,220
If there should be water regurgitation or flood

181
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,350
Don't say I didn't remind you

182
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,950
Water Mystic show yourself

183
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,200
Do you see it

184
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,440
No

185
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,840
A face

186
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,880
Where's the face

187
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,700
Look carefully

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,140
It's a face of a male infant

189
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,580
It's so clear can't you see

190
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,420
His eyes

191
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,670
His nose

192
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,850
His mouth open

193
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,460
He's crying

194
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,460
Yes

195
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,550
I see now

196
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,530
There was a male infant born here

197
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,860
He was born with a face like ferocious ghost, evil water fate

198
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,750
If not taken care of

199
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,620
He's definitely going to court disaster

200
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,010
Bring large number of water sprites

201
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,850
The time of his birth was

202
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,310
It was

203
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,170
A month ago

204
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,030
Yes that's right

205
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,660
Wenpo please tell us more information

206
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,140
We need to find this evil infant

207
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,650
To be Wenpo, we made our vows

208
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,980
If I tell my clients' identity

209
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,610
I will die on the streets and have no chance of reincarnation

210
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,160
The death vow says you can't tell

211
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,290
It doesn't say you can't write

212
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,300
I'll also gift you this runestone for safety

213
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,250
You'll be safe and sound

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,410
We are not done here

215
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,330
You need to survey these three households for me

216
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,840
But I haven't got the money

217
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,450
What money

218
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,020
The money for the runestone

219
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,750
How much is it

220
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,760
You ask me one tael for a shabby stone

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
How dare you call it shabby stone

222
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,380
It's a stone with magic power

223
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,690
Ok ask Ding Mao for it

224
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,640
Why is he involved

225
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,760
We did this for his father's case

226
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,650
Come in

227
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,670
I didn't want to bring food to you

228
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,630
Master sent me here

229
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,500
Thanks Deyou

230
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,740
Don't pretend to work hard

231
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,940
Come and have dinner first

232
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm surveying recent missing persons

233
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,900
What did you find

234
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,850
Nothing yet

235
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,230
How did you drag this tortoise up

236
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,890
Do you want to know

237
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,870
You're good at this

238
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,640
You flatter me

239
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,240
What's soaked in here

240
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,860
It's a human brain

241
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,220
The whole one was taken out and put in here

242
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,990
And this

243
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,780
That's a limax

244
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,670
Its secretion can heal wound infection

245
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,900
Has great clinical value

246
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,490
And that's a tuberculosis sample

247
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,590
The one beside it

248
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,960
It's a heart

249
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,260
No wonder a Young Master could stay peacefully

250
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,750
In morgue-like Yizhuang

251
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,610
Your room is even more scary than Yizhuang

252
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,230
I thought you retrieve corpses a lot

253
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,010
You should see these things often

254
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,830
It's like having dumplings all the time

255
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,200
And suddenly you only get the meat inside

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,840
Of course it's weird

257
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,540
Try this then

258
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,280
What did you stuff in my mouth

259
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,010
It's an olive

260
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,130
Very tasty

261
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't soak these things together ok

262
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,350
What if you mix them up and eat the wrong thing

263
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,670
You were not here for apprenticing right

264
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,470
You wanted to poison us

265
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,930
Science is rigorous

266
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,540
I won't make a mistake

267
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,840
Science

268
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,320
Any progress on your father's case

269
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,510
Any clue on the dead infant

270
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,380
And you

271
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,870
Same here

272
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,840
No clue

273
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,590
I brought you dinner to eat

274
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,330
Don't eat these snacks

275
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,640
What are you doing

276
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,260
I surveyed all the missing persons

277
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,400
No case is about infants

278
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,010
And then I went to the hospital

279
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,160
No birth record that fits

280
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,250
Now that we can't find who the infant belongs to

281
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,450
We can search for the one who stole it instead

282
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,060
This is the first crime scene

283
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,260
Judged from the size and depth of footprints

284
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,770
We should be able to tell

285
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,360
The height and weight of the thief

286
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,620
We can even deduct his age and personality

287
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,150
So did you find him

288
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,760
I did

289
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,680
It's the Xues

290
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,970
You found it

291
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,750
The three families Wenpo mentioned

292
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,160
Two of them are fine

293
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,640
Only Xues are holding a funeral

294
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,170
So it's for the dead infant

295
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,430
None of your business

296
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,210
Just say it

297
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,230
Miss Xue jumped in the river to kill herself the other day

298
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,480
But the Xues didn't make it public

299
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,410
They came to my mother for a rite

300
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,609
The public won't know about this

301
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,859
How old was Miss Xue

302
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,550
They said she was 19

303
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Just the right age for a baby

304
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,020
But you said there was no clue

305
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,260
You want to investigate right

306
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,950
The infant belongs to the Xues in the south

307
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,060
Go check

308
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,610
Wait a moment

309
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,810
How do you want to investigate

310
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,850
They became silent

311
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,620
After stealing the dead infant

312
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,060
The Xues are up to something for sure

313
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,230
Do you think they'll let the police get involved

314
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,970
What should we do then

315
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,490
You can pretend to be a friend of Miss Xue's

316
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,500
You heard she's dead and come to her funeral

317
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,060
Good idea

318
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,060
I'll go first

319
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Master

320
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,670
This is a cheap shot

321
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,760
I learnt it from you Master

322
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,180
There has to be someone making the inquiry

323
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,100
If we don't go harsh on him

324
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,230
How can he make progress

325
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,330
What are you talking about

326
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,070
Dead mother and baby

327
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,530
The family holding the funeral secretly

328
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,540
And coming to Yizhuang to steal the infant

329
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,730
There must be something about the Xues

330
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,270
For these wealthy and influential families

331
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,600
Men should be ambitious while women be chaste

332
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,090
Seeing they hide like this

333
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,480
It's very likely that the Young Lady did the wrong thing

334
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,280
And now a young man coming to their door

335
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,820
Saying he's her good friend

336
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,970
What would the family think

337
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,040
Adulterer

338
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,020
Young Master

339
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,980
May I have your name

340
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,820
I'm Fu Mao

341
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,050
And you are

342
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,010
Xue Qingyang

343
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,730
I'm Yuanyuan's father

344
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,930
Uncle Xue

345
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,100
How did you know my daughter

346
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,850
About a year ago

347
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,260
A year or two

348
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,070
I went to Li's Temple for painting a lot

349
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,810
She admired my paintings

350
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,890
And asked me for techniques

351
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,380
As time went

352
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,810
We became good friends

353
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,880
Then how did you know about

354
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,160
The death of my daughter

355
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,270
As far as I remember

356
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,620
My family didn't tell anyone about this

357
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,470
Actually it's because

358
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,150
I I

359
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,950
Whatever

360
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,350
Since you are here

361
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,220
I've got some wish to accomplish

362
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,900
Your wish

363
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,210
Young master, please

364
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,490
How can you feel?

365
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,350
Is this clothes suitable?

366
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,100
Yes, it is

367
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,230
Well,

368
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,100
when come to mourn

369
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,600
Why do I need to change my clothes?

370
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,300
May I ask you a question?

371
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,890
Please

372
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,000
What is responsibility?

373
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,470
Responsibility

374
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,120
It is to do what you should do

375
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,930
and to take responsibility you should take

376
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,820
I believe that you are a responsible man

377
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,900
You flattered me

378
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,730
Can I ask you a question?

379
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,730
Of course

380
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,160
It's not like the clothes

381
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,050
the clothes we usually wear

382
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,330
It's the same for graveclothes

383
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,950
Is there any misunderstandings?

384
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,970
Why am I wearing graveclothes?

385
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,270
No misunderstanding

386
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,730
To be buried alive with the dead,

387
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,890
these are necessary

388
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,800
To be buried alive with the dead?

389
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,240
A day together as husband and wife means endless devotion the rest of your life

390
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,240
Since you have done such a thing

391
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,970
as you said responsbility

392
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,430
even if you give up your life to accompany with my daughter

393
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,160
that's what it should be

394
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,450
No

395
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,300
I am coming

396
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,020
Is your master in home?

397
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,810
No

398
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,760
It's my mother who does the ritual in your family

399
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,160
Little Immortal

400
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,110
Yesterday, when my mother do some investigations

401
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,910
She saw your house was surrounding with deep resent

402
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,830
and afraid your miss's corpse will be in danger

403
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,340
Therefore, she specially asked me to come and check

404
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,980
Please

405
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,080
Please

406
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,080
Help! H...

407
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,940
Help!

408
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,910
What are you doing？

409
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,990
Wait

410
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,790
Hold him down

411
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,890
You are a people who cravenly cling to life instead of braving death

412
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,080
Bastard

413
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,340
Who let outsiders be in here?

414
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,060
I am the daughter of the with Zhang

415
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
My mother said there is something wrong with yesterday's ritual

416
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,270
Let me check today

417
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,200
about miss Xue's corpse

418
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,430
This is my family business

419
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,770
Today, I didn't invite any withes to come

420
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,090
Young master Ding

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,840
How can you...

422
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,830
Let go. Let go quickly

423
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,860
Can you afford costs if you make me injury?

424
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:16,850
Young master Ding

425
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,920
I don't want to blame you

426
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,080
However, there are so many brothels in Tianjin

427
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,620
Which one is not good for you

428
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,670
Why do you

429
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,700
Why do you must tease

430
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,010
the lady in the grand mansion gate

431
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,420
If this thing is explored to the police station

432
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,330
What do you want your Chamber of Commerce...

433
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,680
What do you want your Chamber of Commerce to do

434
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,520
Don't...

435
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,290
What are you saying?

436
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,270
What?

437
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,690
Don't you know Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation?

438
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,690
Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

439
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,880
Therefore, he is ...

440
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,800
The young master of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation

441
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,930
Ding Mao

442
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,720
who just returned from studying in Germany

443
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,250
with heavy foreign characters

444
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,660
The young master of Chamber of Commerce for Grain Transportation who just returned from abroad

445
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,450
I went to their house to deliver paper

446
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,080
I have seen him. I won't be wrong

447
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,900
It's a misunderstanding

448
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,690
Uncle Gui, help him out, quickly

449
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,020
These are presents for you

450
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,400
as an apopogy

451
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,820
My daughter just died

452
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,900
I am so sad

453
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,450
that I made a misunderstanding

454
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,550
It's my fault

455
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,170
I wish master ding can forgive me

456
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,040
I think

457
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,800
these prerents are not necessary

458
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,720
Please don't refuse

459
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,850
It's my thoughtlessness

460
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,620
which frighten you

461
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,120
It's a matter of course

462
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,260
My daughter's death

463
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,470
It's not a glorious thing

464
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Please

465
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,840
Don't spread this thing

466
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,820
Mr. Xue

467
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,460
You're blocking our mouths

468
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,830
To be honesty

469
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm here to investigate

470
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,620
What you have to say

471
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,930
What you don't need to say

472
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,730
Make a clean breast of them

473
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,210
Would you like to say it here

474
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,770
or go back to the police station to say with me

475
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,490
Then don't blame me

476
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,860
Everyone, calm down

477
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,920
Master Ding, sit down, please

478
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,250
I have no son

479
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,890
but only a daughter

480
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,550
My wife died early

481
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,110
I am especially fond of the little girl

482
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,410
My family can be called a scholar-gentry family

483
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,340
I always keep Yuan Yuan by my side

484
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,430
and teach her in person

485
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,330
for fear that there will be something wrong with her when she goes out

486
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,230
However, in last year

487
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,980
I'll took Yuan Yuan to the temple fair

488
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,800
In a short moment, we were separated

489
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,040
We tried all ways to find her

490
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,360
and report to the police

491
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,730
But there was no news at all

492
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,150
Who can think of that

493
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,220
One day half a year later

494
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,690
Master Master

495
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,230
At that time, we found out after all kinds of questioning

496
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,690
She met a rich young man

497
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,150
I don't know that beast use which mean

498
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,600
to coax Yuan Yuan to elope with him

499
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,240
However, Yuan Yuan is homesick

500
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,910
and finally find a opportunity

501
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,010
to come back

502
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,140
What about the rich man?

503
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,700
When asked about the beast

504
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,190
Yuan Yuan refused to say a word

505
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,770
At that time, I thought

506
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,000
Yuanyuanhuai's child is my Xue family's blood after all

507
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,160
That's the reason why I I ask the midwife for help in private

508
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,760
to deliver the baby

509
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,160
I want Yuan Yuan to raise her child in peace

510
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,510
I didn't expect that when the baby was just full moon

511
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,170
Yuan Yuan sneaked out with her child

512
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,860
When we found her

513
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,530
My little daughter has been floating in the river

514
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,860
The child has never been found

515
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,480
That's right

516
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,440
I just want to find out one thing now

517
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,850
How did miss Xue die

518
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,080
If she jumps herself into the river with her child

519
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,300
it's suicide

520
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,870
If she falls into the river unfortunately

521
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,140
It's an accident

522
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,870
However, if

523
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,230
She ran out and met the rich man

524
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,310
As a result, both mother and child died in the hands of beast

525
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,460
This is the murder, which kills two people

526
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,340
How does Master Ding know that the child is dead

527
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,400
If he's alive, then I need to see him. If he's dead, then I need to see his corpse

528
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,500
My senior fellow apprentice found it

529
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,320
Senior fellow apprentice?

530
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,100
Aren't you little witch's assistant?

531
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,050
Part-time job

532
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,560
In factor, I am a worker in the fifth river's corpse retrieval team

533
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,650
There is a child's corpse

534
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,350
being in Dragon King Temple for several days

535
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,970
He is just a full moon according to his size

536
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,840
We haven't found recently

537
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,250
other dead and abandoned babies

538
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,680
This child should be your daughter's child

539
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,190
OK

540
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,890
Tomorrow I'll let uncle Gui to the Dragon King temple

541
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,600
bring the baby back

542
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,620
He will be buried with her mother together

543
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,710
They can't be buried

544
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,470
The cause of miss Xue's death is unknown

545
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,860
After my autopsy

546
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,170
I will give Mr. Xue an account

547
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,970
Young master Ding

548
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,350
Do you still think my family is not in a mess?

549
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,710
Tianjin has always been a place

550
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,480
where if the people are not promoted, officials wouldn't investigate

551
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,990
We didn't report the case

552
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,190
I don't know if

553
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,710
you pretend to be Yuan Yuan's old friend

554
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,910
to visit us suddenly

555
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,010
it's in line with the rules

556
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,060
the witch, people from corpse retrieval team

557
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,100
came without invitation

558
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,950
Can you compassionate

559
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,750
my mood?

560
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,070
I am very sad because of my daughter's death

561
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,660
Please come back

562
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,490
What are you doing?

563
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,440
Can't I see the child?

564
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,330
You just sent the child away

565
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,660
If not, who will be buried with his mother

566
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,260
How did Xue Yuanyuan die?

567
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,640
How did the child die?

568
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,820
And who's going to steal this child?

569
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,640
We still don't know these

570
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,980
what has a lot to do with my dad's death

571
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,970
When Xue Yuanyuan is buried with the child

572
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,550
All the clues are broken

573
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
Facing this child,

574
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,440
You're going to talk to the kid about what to do with his mother

575
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,740
what to do with his grandpa

576
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,760
what to do with his family

577
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,720
Do you think it's appropriate?

578
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,150
Can you be kind when you speak

579
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,830
The Xue family has made a special arrangement today

580
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,910
for best preparation for this baby

581
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,820
They'll pick up the baby tomorrow

582
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,000
Do what you should do

583
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,820
Don't get in the way of my work here

584
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,180
Bribe

585
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,430
How much can you earn in this work

586
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,360
Master haven't officially accepted you as an apprentice

587
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,210
You're trying to grab my business, aren't you?

588
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,610
This child was picked up with my father

589
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,040
They were picked up by you

590
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,860
You know that best

591
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,660
I have to find out how my father died

592
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,070
Firstly, I have to find out about the child

593
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,600
and Xue family

594
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,500
However, now

595
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,670
I have no means

596
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,280
Therefore, I hire you

597
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,920
to help me to investigate

598
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,320
I'll pay you thirty yuan

599
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,590
What kind of person do you think of me

600
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,210
Fifty yuan

601
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,600
Master Guo

602
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,220
Uncle Gui

603
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,020
Thanks for workers in corpse retrieval team

604
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,400
It's our jobs

605
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,250
You're welcome

606
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,910
Everything is prepared well

607
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,740
The child is in the inner hall

608
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,850
But there are some simple processes

609
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,820
that need to be done

610
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,130
What are these processes?

611
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,910
Uncle Gui has been in Xue family for quite a long time

612
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,480
It's 40 years old, almost half my life since

613
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,160
Then you should have watched miss Xue grow up

614
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,290
Her mother died when she gave birth to Yuan Yuan

615
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,490
The child is closest to the master and me

616
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,890
For me, I have always regarded her as my half daughter

617
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,880
What kind of girl is miss Xue

618
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,150
A silly girl

619
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,080
The master always keeps a close eye on her

620
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,510
She has never seen much of the world,

621
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,900
thinking that in this world,

622
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,990
everyone is as kind as she is.

623
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,760
No one has a bad heart

624
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,800
Do you think

625
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,990
did she die peaceful?

626
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,010
Master Guo

627
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,380
What do you mean?

628
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,510
I don't know

629
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,190
Such a good girl who is a new mother

630
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,180
Was she willing to die

631
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,760
If the master does not investigate,

632
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,390
what can I say as a servant

633
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,470
Uncle Gui

634
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,770
We are workers in corpse retrieval team

635
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,080
No one knows more about the river than I do

636
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,900
Miss Xue died in the river

637
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,250
If you like,

638
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,050
just talk to me,

639
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,110
Maybe I can help you

640
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,120
You can't just

641
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,949
let her die so unknowingly

642
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,159
Yuan Yuan. Yuan Yuan

643
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,389
Yuan Yuan. Yuan Yuan

644
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,179
Master

645
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,900
Uncle Gui, did you see Yuan Yuan?

646
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,690
Doesn't she always care baby in the house?

647
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,520
No

648
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,380
What about the baby?

649
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,330
The baby isn't here

650
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,370
Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Go, quickly

651
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,489
Quickly. Quickly. Quickly.

652
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,100
Go, quickly

653
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,050
You must find her back

654
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,320
I'll go there with an extra dress

655
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,360
We had been looking for most of the night,

656
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,489
but we hadn't seen Miss

657
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,350
When we got back

658
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,700
Master

659
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,700
I fished her out of the river

660
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,580
What about the baby?

661
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,890
You mean that

662
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,900
You didn't see Xue Yuanyuan's corpse

663
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,000
fished up from the river with your own eyes

664
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,760
There are bodies in the river

665
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,510
Corpse retrieval team should know it firstly

666
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,930
What are you wanting to say

667
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,600
It's getting late

668
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,990
Send the child back to recognize his mother

669
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,840
Uncle Gui

670
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,340
Why don't I give you a hand

671
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,730
There are many rules in it

672
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,860
I'm afraid the servants don't understand it

673
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,820
to make a  taboo

674
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,320
I don't have to trouble you with this

675
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,870
Be a kind man to the end

676
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,830
Send Buddha to the West
