my God reached out his hand of affection.

A God and a commoner in a miraculous collaboration.

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,960
♫ Just a few more centimeters, just a few centimeters to you ♫

321
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,150
♫ This frustrating distance where I can't touch you ♫

322
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,830
♫ You and me ♫

Sorry, Kaneda. There's something I haven't told you.

324
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,514
I wonder if the love alarm will go off.

325
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,737
I wonder what he was thinking.

326
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,183
I'll do anything, please.

327
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,428
Your training time is over.

328
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:56,578
Alarm, please don't ring.

329
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:57,951
I'm glad you were with me.

330
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,005
Please don't pound, heart!
