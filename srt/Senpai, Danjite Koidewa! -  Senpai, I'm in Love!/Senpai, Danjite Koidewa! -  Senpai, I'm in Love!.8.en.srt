I'll end the call now. Let's talk later.

169
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,559
Kaneda, wait.

170
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,553
You know...

171
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:42,511
I... haven't changed.

172
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:47,694
Since the day I left you,

173
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:53,165
I still feel the exact same way about you.

174
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,782
You may not want to hear this, but I had to tell you this.

175
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,604
A year is a long time, huh?

176
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:16,265
Even if you've forgotten that day,

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,220
you've done nothing wrong.

178
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:28,232
- That's all.
- Yanase-san?

179
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,826
Yanase-san, please wait.

180
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm leaving, so you leave too.

181
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:44,266
Geez, I ended up saying it.

182
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,616
How am I supposed to greet him tomorrow?

183
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,487
Yanase-san!

184
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,288
No, I can't look at Kaneda's face.

185
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,528
Please wait, Yanase-san!

186
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,328
Jun-san!

187
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:02,879
"10 things I want to do with Kaneda."

188
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:08,140
"Call him by his first name."

189
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:14,060
He said mine first.

190
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:25,656
I thought you changed in the last year.

191
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,290
I changed?

192
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,760
Since you were so cold to me after you came back.

193
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,110
You were, too.

194
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,990
I was so shy after all that time,

195
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,595
that I couldn't speak to you.

196
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:43,557
Oh, Yanase-san!

197
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,590
Welcome back.

198
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,918
I'm back.

199
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:52,184
I was worried your feelings may have changed.

200
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,860
It made me anxious.

201
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:04,860
So I tried hard to talk to you through office work.

202
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:09,632
What about Furukawa?

203
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,940
He's just a Kouhai!

204
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:30,416
You taught me so much, Yanase-san,

205
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:35,810
so I felt obligated to teach him, too.

206
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,120
But, as expected...

207
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,540
it's hard to be someone's Senpai.

208
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:53,711
I always want to be your Kouhai.

209
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,101
But...

210
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:05,260
that's not enough for me.

211
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,400
Senpai,

212
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,280
I like you.

213
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:23,830
Just like one year ago.

214
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:27,800
No,

215
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:34,210
I like you way more than a year ago.

216
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:44,100
[I want to tell you that I like you in person.]

217
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:55,860
You told me this a year ago,

218
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:59,740
and I wanted to be the one to say it this time.

219
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,840
But

220
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,320
I was too scared to say anything.

221
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,840
Sorry, I'm so pathetic.

222
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:23,810
Can you say it now, then?

223
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,680
Kaneda,

224
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,880
I...

225
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,387
Stop!

226
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:45,898
Do it next time.

227
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,746
Why?

228
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,513
We're at work.

229

231
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:03,931
Make it up to me next time.

232
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,372
- Here we go.
- Okay.

233
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,527
Nice throw.

234
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,602
- Here I go.
- Okay.

235
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:25,415
Wait, hold on.

236
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,390
That's incredible.

237
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:36,070
Great. Shift your weight from your right foot to your left foot, and throw!

238
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,621
That was nice.

239
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:40,741
It'll be even better if you time your throw later.

240
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,113
I don't really get that.

241
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,914
Not like that.

242
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,253
- Like this.
- Like this?

243
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:54,679
No, it's more like this.

244
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:55,818
Like this?

245
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,577
- Like this.
- Place it further forward.

246
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:01,391
- Like this.
- Yes, exactly! Got it now?

250

Are you okay? Is it not too heavy?

251
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:21,420
This is nothing. The weather's great, isn't it?

252
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,272
True.

253
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:26,184

One more. Here.

257
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,634
Oh.

258
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:49,914
This is...

259
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:55,618
I thought you changed it.

260
00:19:55,618 --> 00:20:00,040
I thought Furukawa would see it, so I changed it to this.

261
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,747
Huh? How did you know?

262
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:03,888
Who knows?

263
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,489
I'll take this.

264
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:08,638
- I can carry this.
- It's fine.

265
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:10,651
Let me carry it.

266
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,477
Then take this one.

267
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:14,408
Okay.

268
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,407
- Time to eat.
- Time to eat.

269
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,348
Mm! This is good!

270
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:28,749
I'm glad.

271

00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:34,637
Okay.

Huh? This taste is...

274
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,235
How is it? Is it like your mom's?

275
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,558
It's exactly like it.

276
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:54,723
That's great. I made a lot, so eat up.

277
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,024
Okay!

278
