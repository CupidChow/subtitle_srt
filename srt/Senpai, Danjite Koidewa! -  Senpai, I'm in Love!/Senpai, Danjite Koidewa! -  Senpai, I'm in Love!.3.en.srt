- Yeah.

The stage for Red Honey's battle is at a temple this time.

56
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:56,751
In a fierce battle with her fated enemy, the temple is completely destroyed.

57
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,430
Stop the spoilers!

58
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:01,464
Nakayama, this is work.

59
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,874
So, they're doing it in a temple.

60
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,708
The battle, right? Because this is an action film.

61
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,677
No, I'm talking about something else.

62

LO-VE.

Sorry.

64
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,955
Red Honey's also going to say "I love you" a lot in this movie.

65
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:21,319
Is she saying it to the enemy? Is that all right?

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,491
No, no, no.

67
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:26,844
She's unable to express those feelings, so she says it in her heart as she fights.

68
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:30,694
- That's hilarious!
- No, it's a tear-jerker.

We are not only in charge of modeling,

- Not at all.

Looks like things are going well with Yanase, too.

92
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:11,616
I think it's because he's kind.

93

Look at that couple over there in contrast.

94

It's a mistake that shouldn't be made, don't you think?

Yes, I'm sorry.

96

He's been lecturing him for a while.

97
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,850
Ichikawa isn't a bad guy.

98
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,943
But he's kind of strict and inflexible,

99
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:32,214
so he doesn't match Iguchi well.

100
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,648
I feel like it should've been the opposite.

101
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:38,843
The serious Kaneda with Ichikawa. The carefree Iguchi with Yanase.

102
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,170
That makes more sense.

(T/N: a temple in Kyoto)

114

Japanese temples are incredibly detailed,

115
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,839
so they're great for modeling.

116
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:28,302
Hey, Kaneda. Do you want to visit temples instead of me?

Wait, really?

119

To be honest, I joined this industry because I want to model muscles.

Oh, is that so?

- Okay.

167
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,885
Wow, it's so pretty.

168
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:12,698
Isn't this unrelated to work?

169

It's fine.

170
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:22,911
These roses look amazing.

171
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:27,068
No, the one who looks amazing is you.

172
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:31,522
Flowers and Yanase-san. What a great pair.

173
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,222
I want to take a photo...

174
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:37,015
But if I take one now, he'll probably notice.

175
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,406
Um, could you take our photo?

176
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:44,155
Say "cheese."

177
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:50,309
Thank you.

178
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,345
Shall we take a photo of you?

179
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,459
No, we're in the middle of work.

180
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,260
Please do it.

181
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,248
Give her the camera, Kaneda.

182
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,613
Here we go. Say "cheese."

183
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:06,876
You're too tense, sir.

184
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,725
Give us a smile.

185
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,270
Kaneda, smile.

186
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,974
Take it again.

187
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:15,752
Say "cheese."

188
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:29,646
- Iguchi, can we talk?
- Yes.

189
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:33,114
Listen, can you give me the skin texture material I asked for?

190
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:35,569
Wasn't that by tomorrow?

191
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,906
We need it today to get the work done by tomorrow.

192
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:41,670
So, you haven't taken any photos yet?

193
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:46,476
Sorry, I completely misunderstood. I'll go take them now.

194
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:49,754
You can't get that level of skin detail on a smartphone.

195
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,958
Use a single-lens reflex camera.

196
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:57,034
- Well, Kaneda is using that camera right now...
- What?

197
00:12:57,034 --> 00:13:00,171
Can't I use my phone for now?

198
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,350
Wow, this is tasty.

199
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:21,076
Is it okay to eat this stuff during work?

200
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:23,983
Don't be so serious! This is fine.

201
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:27,006
Think of it as a perk.

202
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,607
I see.

203
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:36,392
I'm always staring at a screen, so this is nice once in a while.

204
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,569
Yes.

205
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:43,256
Yours looks tasty too. Can I try it?

206
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,995
Go ahead.

207
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,688
That's good!

208
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:58,106
Try mine, too.

209
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:59,716
I'm fine.

210
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:03,141
Come on, it's fine. Chomp down.

211
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:07,400
Okay, thank you.

212
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:14,102
It's good.

213
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:17,717
Let me borrow the camera.

214
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:19,458
For what?

215
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,856
Since we're here, I'll shoot some flowers since they're pretty.

216
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:26,726
Oh, I'll take them.

217
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:29,301
Don't worry, eat your churro.

218
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:41,592
What? Are you serious?

219
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:43,741
No way, I can't do that.

220
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,364
Please, I'm begging you.

221
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:49,085
I just need a photo of someone shirtless on that camera.

222
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:51,959
You want me to take a half-naked picture of Yanase-san?

223
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,850
I can't do that.

224
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,040
- Then let Yanase-san take a photo of you.
- That's even worse!

225
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,420
I beg you, Kaneda.

226
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:03,107
I keep messing up lately.

227
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:07,458
If I don't do it, Ichikawa-san will hate me.

228
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:10,142
Aren't we friends?

229
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,770
How many half-naked photos do you need?

230
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:18,039
Well, it's for a texture, so I need them in parts.

231
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,161
What? In parts?

232
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,529
What do you mean?

233
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,098
- First, I need the nape.
- Nape?

234
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,503
- Collarbone.
- Collarbone?

235
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:31,608
A pose with shoulder blades together.

236
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,574
Shoulder blades together?

237
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:35,520
- Then...
- Stop right there.

238
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,200
I seriously can't do it. Ask someone else.

239
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:42,958
I can't believe this. I can't take photos of Yanase-san naked, even for work.

240
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,405
I'm so embarrassed, I could die.

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:25,710
Okay.

252
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,353
Um, Yanase-san...

253
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,984
What's wrong? Sit down too.

00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:55,892
Can I ask for a favor?

255
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:57,505
Yeah.

256
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:01,774
This is very hard for me to say.

257
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:06,240
I'm going to take my clothes off,

258
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,759
so could you please take photos

259
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,827
of me with this camera?

00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:17,924

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,747

And please don't tell Yanase-san.

265

I don't want him to think I'm hopeless.

266

You're such an idiot, Iguchi.

267
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,497
I'm really sorry.

268
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,718
I can't tell you the reason.

Please.

271
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:49,260
I need to take it off...

272
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:59,375
I need to take it off.

273
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,511
You're shaking.

274
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:21,366
Don't force yourself if you don't want to.

275
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:24,696
But... I need them no matter what.

You need these photos, right? Take them.

278
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:48,453
Next, show me your back and put your shoulder blades together.

279
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,235
Please relax your shoulder blades.
