00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:04,093
How dare you say all that nonsense?

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:06,722
Shut up, you don't know anything about Yanase-san!

3
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:09,913
Kaneda, why are you here?

4
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:20,483
Well, um...

5
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:23,472
What a coincidence.

6
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:28,234
I was drinking here alone and heard you two talking.

7
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:31,053
Oh, is that so?

8
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,578
Was I intruding?

9
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,418
Perfect timing.

10
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:38,943
Sit with us and drink.

11
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,876
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,210
Earlier, you told me I don't know anything, right?

13
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,167
No, I didn't say that.

14
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:04,074
I'm confident I know Jun better than you do.

15
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:08,997
I know the current Yanase-san better than you do.

16
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:14,457
Then do you know what face Jun makes when he sleeps?

17
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:17,106
What? I don't.

18
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:18,907
Benji, stop it.

19
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:23,116
I know many sides of Jun that you don't.

20
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,187
Regardless, it's not okay to say those horrible things.

21
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,597
"Horrible things"?

22
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:34,137
That his quality has gone down or that he's becoming a nobody.

23
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,550
Yanase-san's skills are amazing!

24
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,690
Also...

25
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,520
it's not just his abilities.

26
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:51,834
There's his thoughtfulness and beliefs as a creator,

27
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,507
and his open-mindedness as a person.

28
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:58,082
Even a guy like me,

29
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:01,657
he's kind enough to teach patiently and thoroughly.

30
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:05,717
Everything about him is amazing.

31
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:08,677
Kaneda...

32
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:18,437
Please take back the word "nobody".

33
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:19,807
No, I won't.

34
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,167
Why not?

35
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:25,415
It'll be better for Jun to tell him the truth.

36
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,246
But...

37
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:28,826
Yanase-san isn't a nobody.

38
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:33,257
When you care for someone, being strict is a form of love.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,446
I don't know much about love and such, but...

40
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:42,077
If you're that mad, doesn't that mean you love Jun?

41
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:46,082
- What?
- Benji, give it a rest.

42
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,637
You're troubling him.

43
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,077
I know that Jun's talent is...

44
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,866
It's just as Benjamin-san says.

45
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:59,146
I might've only been looking at Senpai's cool side.

46
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:03,767
If it'll help Jun, I don't mind being hated.

47
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:09,567
If you don't have that resolve, can you stay out of it?

48
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,975
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,625
I'll excuse myself.

- I apologize for earlier.
- I was happy.

63
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:33,047
It made me happy

It's fine.

Oh, I have to head home now.

68

Are you okay at this hour? Are there trains left?

Oh, they're all gone.

But it's okay, I'll stay at the office.

You'll catch a cold there.

It's fine, I've never caught one before.

You can't.

What if it affects your work?

Look at this place.

It's so stylish.

So this is what it's like to live in these towers.

83

I'll have a chochu highball.

Okay.

Thank you.

He's drinking so fast. He must've been thirsty.

93
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:41,297
Maybe it's because he ran after me.

That's how Yanase-san smells at work.

99
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,605
What a nice smell.

100

What? Yanase-san?

Oh, that's not it.

105

He eats it at the end.

106
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:55,617
I see, he gets to enjoy it twice.

107
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,475
He enjoys the chocolate,

108
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:05,187
and then he can appreciate the cookie part you hold in your hand.

I love sweet things.

117

00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,282
Senpai!

169
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:52,563
Wait... my heart's not ready yet.

170
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:57,955
I'm kidding.

171
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:01,672
I can't sleep without this pillow, so I'll take this.

172
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:06,826
What a relief.

173
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:11,215
Wait, am I relieved? Am I not?

174
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,597
I can't sleep at all. It's impossible.

175
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,872
I can't sleep!

176
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,425
Are you awake?

177
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,426
I overslept!

178
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,155
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

179
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,026
Go wash your face.

180
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,941
Wow, what is this?

181
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,732
Avocado toast with eggs.

182
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,629
And this is a spinach bacon salad.

183
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:24,867
So stylish.

184
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,306
Oh, are you okay with bread?

185
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,577
Of course.

186
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,899
That's great. Come eat. Sit.

187
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,200
Okay.

188
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:41,236
- Let's eat.
- Thank you for the meal.

189
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,619
How do you eat this?

190
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:58,954
I see, so that's how you eat it.

191
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:05,350
Cut it with a knife and fork, and...

192
00:15:09,623 --> 00:15:11,981
But he still uses his hand in the end.

193
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,138
It's good.

194
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:24,968
Great. I can make more, so eat up.

195
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,369
Okay.

196
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,849
I get to eat Yanase-san's home cooking. It's like a dream.

197
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,045
Thank you.

198
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:48,900
Coming to work together would be bad, right?

199
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:53,990
Senpai, I have some preparations to make, so I'll go ahead.

200
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,391
Sure.

201
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,500
No way.

202
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:07,368
As our Red Honey work reached its peak...

203
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,485
- Yanase-san?
- Yes?

204
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:10,952
- Can you look here.
- Sure.

205
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,772
How is this sculpting?

206
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:17,206
Yeah, it looks good.

207
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,372
But if you want to match the overall tone,

208
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,955
you should add a bit more greenery here.

209
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:26,666
He spends less time next to me.

210
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,714
Yanase, come here when you're done.

211
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,215
Okay.

212
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:38,372
But...

213
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:42,261
strangely, I don't feel lonely.

214
00:16:55,307 --> 00:17:00,201
I feel like our hearts have gotten closer.

215
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,253
Yanase-san?

216
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,899
Yeah, what is it?

217
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:29,370
Yes.

218
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,060
I got it. Goodbye.

219
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,310
Did everyone go home?

220
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,751
Yes, there's no overtime today.

221
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:41,377
Oh, really? I completely forgot.

222
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:44,074
You should leave early today too.

223
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:45,775
I'll finish up.

224
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:53,717
Yeah, this is looking good.

225
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,313
Thank you.

226
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:01,617
Iguchi's not here, so I can finally praise your work.

227
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:04,853
What do you mean?

228
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,837
He lost his confidence for a time, right?

229
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:12,317
Despite his looks, he's sensitive.

230
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:14,377
If I praise you too much in front of him,

231
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:17,701
it might hurt his feelings.

232
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:21,052
Senpai is so kind.

233
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:30,531
So that's why you gave me this golden star.

234
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,211
Hey, don't keep that rubbish.

235
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,469
It's not rubbish.

236
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:40,052
It makes me happier than any other star you've given me.

237
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,852
Geez, I'm tired.

238
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:54,018
You seem exhausted, so you should get home and rest.

239
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:58,921
But this isn't exhaustion that I can fix with rest.

240
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,422
How do you fix it then?

241
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:07,452
I'm not sure... Maybe with something sweet.

242
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:21,231
Two amanatsu and yuzu parfaits, please.

243
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:22,509
I apologize.

244
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,801
We only have one parfait left.

245
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:28,501
Oh, I see.

246
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,651
Thank you for waiting.

247
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:48,598
This is so delicious.

248
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:50,949
Please eat the rest if you like.

249
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:54,209
It's fine, have some.

250
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:00,329
Thank you.

251
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:11,195
It's good.

252
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,896
Right?

253
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,489
Have some, Yanase-san.

254
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,710
Eat that.

255
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,987
I'll take it then.

256
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,367
That hits the spot!

257
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,330
Here.

258
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:37,240
This is annoying.

259
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,329
Kaneda, come here.

260
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:42,418
Okay.

261
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,035
I was happy.

262
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:03,633
Time with Senpai, just the two of us.

263
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:24,989
I thought this happiness would continue forever.

264
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:40,156
As for our partnership with Max Pictures,

265
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:43,615
headquarters has given us official permission.

266
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:47,527
Really? What a relief.

267
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:49,045
Thank you.

268
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:53,154
I will be the one to sign the contract with you.

269
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:55,905
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

270
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:06,524
However, I have one condition for this contract.

271
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,603
What is it?

272
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:13,653
You will be an important partner for us in our future work,

273
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:15,929
so we have to get to know each other better.

274
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:20,670
For that reason, I think we should exchange employees.

275
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,464
Thus...

276
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,291
Brush this up, too.

277
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,792
Okay.

278
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:32,059
- Here, too.
- We'd like you to send

279
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,582
Yanase Jun to our company.

280
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:47,988
Senpai,

281
00:22:49,221 --> 00:22:51,416
for now and forever...

282
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:58,945
I want to stay by your side.

There's no point in looking up to me.
