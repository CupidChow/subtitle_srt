00:11:57,642 --> 00:11:59,880
Where's Yanase-san?

168
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,406
The two of them went to drink at a bar called Marigold.

169
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:06,111
It's been a while, so they probably went to catch up.

170
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:08,914
Didn't he come to meet the President?

171
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:12,973
- Oh, we met in the elevator.
- Well, that was brief.

172
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:17,488
I guess Yanase was his main objective. They make quite a pair.

173
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,071
Excuse me.

174
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:26,042
It's a bit early, but I'll go home now.

175
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,146
I keep messing up lately.

176
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:36,831
If I don't do something, Ichikawa-san will hate me.

177
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:45,536
Iguchi!

178
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:00,555
Were the photos I sent you okay?

179
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:03,047
Oh, they were fine.

180
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:07,822
Yanase-san was supposed to take photos of me,

181
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:10,898
but I was too embarrassed.

182
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:15,590
So Yanase-san offered to do it instead.

183
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,005
He was so cool.

184
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:28,754
- I was glad I was put under his care─
- Hey, Kaneda.

185
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,663
- Did you call me over to brag?
- No, that's not it.

186
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:37,974
Do you want me to tell you what Ichikawa-san said when I gave him the photos?

187
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:41,486
"Kaneda sure is impressive."

188
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:46,057
It must be nice for you.

189
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:48,280
You're with a kind Senpai,

190
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,750
and everyone recognizes your abilities.

191
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,530
I'm not as good with CG as you are.

192
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,616
Wait, Iguchi...

193
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,875
I don't think I care much anymore.

194
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,608
- Iguchi.
- Honestly,

195
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,986
I don't even like CG that much.

196
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:11,090
I just thought I'd be good at it.

197
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,924
I'm going to quit the company.

198
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,096
Keep at it, Kaneda.

199
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,636
Is this really okay?

200
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:32,918
Oh sure, got it!

201
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,541
Good luck at your meeting, Ichikawa-san.

202
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:37,354
I'll work hard, so I can be of use to everyone as soon as possible!

203
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:41,037
You and Iguchi are both important Kouhai to me.

204
00:14:41,037 --> 00:14:43,442
I want you two to keep loving CG.

205
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,484
- Come with me.
- What? Let go.

206
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:55,554
Let's go see Ichikawa-san.

207
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,623
What? I don't want to. Let me go.

208
00:14:57,624 --> 00:15:00,716
- At this rate─
- Stop it!

209
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:05,928
Stop looking down on me just because you're better than me!

210
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,812
If you think I'm better,

211
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:13,190
then why can't I make any proper models?

212
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,109
I'd spend more than a week making CGs,

213
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:19,622
yet they're uglier than the ones you make in one day!

214
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,244
Hey, let go.

215
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,229
Shut up, you coward!

216
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,399
Of course, they don't recognize your abilities.

217
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,186
It's still our first year.

218
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:34,495
If you mess up, just apologize!

219
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,926
Don't run away without even apologizing.

220
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,558
And...

221
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:43,000
I want you to keep loving CG.

222
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,460
I apologize.

223
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:03,811
I'll start from the ground up again to earn your trust.

224
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:08,919
May I please ask you to watch over me again?

225
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:23,996
Let's go.

226
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,522
Does that mean we've made up?

227
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:31,725
I'm not your friend, you know.

228
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,343
Then let's go drinking!

229
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:38,296
You're my Senpai, so please cover the bill.

230
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,668
Was I able to return

231
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:45,811
a bit of what Senpai gave me?

232
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,019
He's so cool.

233
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,935
All right, now I can see it every day.

234
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,476
I used to live with Jun in Vancouver.

235
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,082
We moved in together back then.

236
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,369
I wonder if they're still together.

237
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:40,059
Don't think about it.

238
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,542
I can always be by his side at work.

239
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:47,831
That's enough, isn't it?

240
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,084
Let me borrow the camera.

241
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,545
For what?

242
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:06,190
Since we're here, I'll shoot some flowers since they're pretty.

243
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,891
Does this have the flower photos?

244
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,791
I'll go through them for him.

245
00:18:57,075 --> 00:19:01,199
Since we're here, I'll shoot some flowers since they're pretty.

246
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,333
That's even worse!

247
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,417
Something beautiful.

248
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:26,772
Kaneda, smile.

249
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:35,340
If photos were invented to capture a moment with a loved one...

250
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,061
Senpai...

251
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:00,691
What am I to you?

252
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:13,209
I see, Michael's working hard too, huh?

253
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,309
Yeah.

254
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,416
By the way, that boy at your work today...

255
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,575
Kaneda-kun, was it?

256
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:23,347
Is he your boyfriend now?

257
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,242
What? They're already going into it?

258
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:31,396
I'm not ready for this.

259
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,807
Welcome.

260
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,835
Oh, um...

261
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,432
- Can I sit here?
- Go ahead.

262
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:40,547
- I'll start with a beer.
- A beer? All right.

263
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,245
What's this all of a sudden?

264
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,859
I have reasons to think so.

265
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,540
Do you want to hear them?

266
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,321
I want to hear them.

267
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:58,440
When I said I had moved in with you, the first person you looked at was him.

268
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:03,674
You absolutely didn't want him to know.

269
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,725
Is that true?

270
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:08,874
So, tell me.

271
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,311
Is he your lover?

272
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,530
He's...

273
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:27,952
just a Kouhai.

274
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,275
You don't have to admit it,

275
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,650
but I trust my intuition.

276
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,806
So, let me tell you this.

277
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:46,560
If you want to succeed as a CG artist, break up with him.

278
00:21:47,882 --> 00:21:50,607
We're not dating yet.

279
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,575
Wait, "yet"?

280
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,790
Jun.

281
00:21:55,563 --> 00:22:00,019
When I gave you all this project, I saw your online portfolio.

282
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,601
Honestly, I was disappointed.

283
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,115
You haven't added anything since Vancouver.

284
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:12,649
Not only that, but your work's quality has decreased significantly.

285
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,581
What's wrong with this guy?

286
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:17,067
He's spouting nonsense.

287
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:25,962
If you want to date someone in Japan and spend your days peacefully, that's fine.

288
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,954
But I think highly of you.

289
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:32,264
Soon enough, you'll be nothing.

290
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:36,547
You don't know anything about the current Senpai!

291
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,363
You've headed straight there already.

292
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,273
How dare you say all that nonsense?

293
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:49,205
Shut up, you don't know anything about Yanase-san!

294
