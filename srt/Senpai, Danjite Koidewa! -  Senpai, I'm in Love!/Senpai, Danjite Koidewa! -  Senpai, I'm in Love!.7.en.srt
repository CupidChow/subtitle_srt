Regarding this part, our company...

172
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,744
Of course he's gone, considering how late it is.

173
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,600
Do you want to leave together?

174
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:11,696
Kaneda, did you leave already?

175
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:21,549
We'll be leaving now.

176
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,050
See you.

177
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,840
Sorry, I just saw this. I'm already home.

178
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,960
We still haven't had a chance to leave work together yet.

I missed him today, too.

181
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,100
I'll be waiting.

182
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,780
Nothing lasts forever,

184
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,659
Yanase-san!

185
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,291
Kaneda.

186
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,109
W-What's wrong?

187
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,680
Are you waiting for someone?

188
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,730
Um, I was waiting for you.

189
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,029
Huh?

190
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,763
Don't get your hopes up, idiot!

191
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:35,309
Betrayal will only upset you.

192
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,878
What's wrong?

193
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,580
Did you have a question about work?

194
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,150
Well...

195
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:45,819
Yes.

196
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,279
See? I knew it.

197
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,609
About CG? Want to go back in?

198
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,610
No, it's fine.

199
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,145
Um...

200
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,540
Let's walk and talk.

201
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,630
Sure, let's go.

202
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,430
He's not talking. Is his question that serious?

203
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,370
It really seems to be serious. I want to help him.

204
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,455
Wait, I wasn't paying attention. Where are we?

205
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:50,019
What is it?

206
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,690
Um... We're here.

207
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,430
Where are we?

208
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,000
This is my house.

209
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,070
"M-My house"?

210
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,190
Wait.

211
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,471
- Come in.
- Sure.

212
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:17,582
Sorry, I have to go to the restroom.

213
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:19,182
Oh, okay.

214
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,026
- Please take a seat.
- Sure.

215
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:32,475
Wow, so this is where Kaneda lives.

216
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Oh.

217
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,788
A temple model.

218
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:42,651
He likes temples, after all.

219
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,884
Why are there milk and sugar?

220
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:53,174
Maybe those are offerings?

221
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,190
Please don't look!

222
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,691
Sorry!

223
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,879
Um, I'll make some tea now, so please take a seat.

224
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,587
Sure, got it.

225
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,720
He's on edge because of his worries.

226
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,748
I need to be more careful.

227
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,850
Where should I sit?

228
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,840
On the chair or on the bed?

229
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,869
Normally, you would never sit on the bed.

230
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,449
So you should sit on the chair.

231
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,128
But there's a shirt on the chair.

232
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,968
If I sit on it,

233
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:41,403
I'll crush the shirt with my back.

234
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:44,864
That would be rude.

235
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:53,960
There's a hanger!

236
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:58,814
I'm saved. I'll hang up his shirt with this.

237
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,993
Wait, hold on.

238
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:07,703
Is it okay to hang someone's shirt without asking?

239
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:12,086
It's kind of presumptuous and pushy, isn't it?

240
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,865
All right, he'll be done soon.

241
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:24,084
Then I'll waste some time until he's done with the tea.

242
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:31,784
Huh? Isn't this from last year?

243
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:41,314
No!

244
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:46,114
S-S-Sorry!

245
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:54,456
Huh? Did I do something? What did I do?

246
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,696
Don't look around like that!

247
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:58,684
Okay, I'll be careful.

248
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:07,288
Sorry for making you help.

249
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:08,988
No, it's fine.

250
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,177
Ouch.

251
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:15,345

00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,024
I'm fine.

00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:51,165
Okay, all better now.

254
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:53,680

255
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,181
Okay.

It's Furukawa.

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,231
Of course.

Kaneda-san, where are you right now?

I'm at home.

275

Are you with someone?

276
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,432
No, I'm alone.

277
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,552
Huh?

278
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,457
Did he say he's alone?

279
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:48,218
- That's great. Want to come to my house?
- What?

280
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:51,474
Come on, I said I have a pet iguana, right?

281
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:53,962
I wanted you to see him.

282
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:59,232
If you see the texture, I think it'll help when making the CG.

283
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,490
Can you take a photo of it?

284
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:04,546
What?

285
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:07,087
Isn't it better to see the real thing?

286
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:10,634
Well, of course it is, but...

287

Oh, so you're too lazy to get out of your house, right?

Right, that's why.

289
