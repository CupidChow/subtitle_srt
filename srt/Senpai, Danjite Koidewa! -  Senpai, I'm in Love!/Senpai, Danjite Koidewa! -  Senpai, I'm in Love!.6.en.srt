00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:02,163
Vancouver?

2
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:03,764
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:07,046
Benjamin-san wants you.

4
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:09,561
From when?

5
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:12,748
Right after we complete Red Honey.

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,632
That's sudden.

7
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,726
Of course, we won't force you.

8
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,835
I want to hear your opinion.

9
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:24,568
- I...
- I really want you to go.

10
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:28,499
You don't need me anymore, do you?

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,795
That's not it.

12
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,983
Benjamin-san's company is a driving force in the world's CG industry.

13
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:37,741
If you work there, you'll become even better.

14
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:41,408
It's a great opportunity for you.

15
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:49,682
You can take your time and think it over.

[Senpai, This Can't be Love!]

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,621
Yanase-san, do you have a minute?

27
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:46,941
[Episode 6]

28
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,242
What is it?

29
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:53,532
The client replied that they'd like to have this pillar converted into metal,

30
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:56,309
but aren't Japan's temples generally made of wood?

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,097
I think this is way better.

32
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:06,510
It's as Nakayama says,

33
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:08,223
but...

34
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:11,321
No, let's do as the client says.

35
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:12,908
Oh, okay.

36
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,309
All right.

37
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,313
I'm doing this as a professional.

38
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:27,613
If you just follow the instructions, the quality of the work will suffer.

39
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,507
I'm not asking your opinion.

40
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,004
Make it the way the client wants it.

41
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,220
That is your job.

42
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:38,019
Just make it the way you're told.

43
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,481
When I began thinking that way, my heart closed up.

44
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:49,481
And something disappeared from within.

45
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:50,764
Got it.

46
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:52,996
It's what the customer wants.

47
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:54,247
It can't be helped.

48
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,428
I'll see how far I get today.

49
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,538
Sorry and thanks.

50
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,144
Yanase-san!

51
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:12,288
Sorry, I was spacing out.

52
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:17,178
Are you really okay with those metal pillars?

53
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:21,287
Well, it's what the client wants.

54
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,966
We just have to make it as they ask.

55
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,168
I'm pathetic, right?

56
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,632
Sorry for being such an undependable Senpai.

57
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,358
That's not true.

58
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,715
You're a wonderful person.

59
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:42,840
Being coached by you like this

60
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:46,239
allows me to learn so many techniques up close.

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,382
That's...

62
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:49,566
- And Yanase-san...
- Stop it!

63
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:58,936
I'm not as great as you say I am.

64
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:02,149
Every time you say I am, I want to run away.

65
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,754
I'm a failure.

66
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:16,297
I'm a weakling, and all I do is run and hide.

67
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,761
Wake up.

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,160
I'm not worth looking up to.

69
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,686
I'm not going to Vancouver.

70
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,108
Hey.

71
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,850
This is a big chance for you.

72
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,574
CG is just work, isn't it?

73
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:10,818
I'm not going to change my lifestyle to aim for the top.

74
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,333
Jun, don't lie to your heart.

75
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:18,311
It's true you were a lost cause.

76
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:21,454
I thought nothing I said would go through to you,

77
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,122
but it's different now.

78
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:26,561
Come to me.

79
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:30,062
I can give you bigger work.

80
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,335
Well...

81
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:37,346
Sorry to interrupt.

82
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:40,439
Can I just show you one thing?

83
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:51,494
We received instructions to change the pillar material...

84
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,197
but making temples out of metal makes no sense.

85
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,108
Hinoki Wood is used for temples for a reason.

86
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:04,327
A century or two after being cut down,

87
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:07,012
the wood gets stronger with time.

88
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,067
Stop it, Kaneda.

89
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,708
Don't be like the old me.

90
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:16,865
And wood brings out a quality that metal can't.

91
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:21,746
- If you get rid of this, you'll lose an important element...
- No, it didn't start here.

92
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:26,490
Ever since we met, this guy...

93
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,390
So I think the original plan is much better.

94
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,107
Could you please reconsider your request?

95
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,794
Okay. Sure.

96
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,233
Really?

97
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,888
Thank you!

98
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:54,011
Kaneda-kun, I see you like CG.

99
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,503
Yes, I love it.

100
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,442
I see.

101
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:06,434
That's why I... about Kaneda...

102
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:10,229
I fell in love with CG thanks to Yanase-san.

103
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:13,254
You're wrong, Kaneda.

104
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,135
I'm the one learning from you.

105
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:22,050
Well then, I'll get going.

106
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:26,579
Jun, I haven't given up yet.

107
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:35,816
Huh? What was he talking about?

108
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,899
Nothing important.

109
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,327
Is that so.

110
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,778
Oh, I'll go tell Nakayama-san.

111
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,179
Kaneda!

112
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:53,154
About before...

113
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,927
Thanks.

114
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,293
Not at all.

115
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:23,911
Here's this month's financial report.

116
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:27,511
We'll have to lower our expenses.

117
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,440
Come in.

118
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,444
Excuse me.

119
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,413
What's is it, Yanase?

120
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,832
I've decided to take up Benjamin's offer.

121
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,167
I'll give it a try.

122
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,807
I see?

123
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:44,707
I see. Got it.

124
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:48,215
I wanted to tell you before I changed my mind.

125
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:51,329
That's all. Thank you.

126
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:58,530
- All right!
- What is he giving a try?

127
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:02,541
Yanase-san is going to Vancouver for a while.

128
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,281
Don't tell anyone yet.

129
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,917
Kaneda!

130
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:25,790
Senpai hadn't touched me for so long.

131
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,105
Good work today.

132
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:29,607
Have a drink.

133
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,504
Really?

134
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,439
Thank you.

135
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,809
What's the matter?

136
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:44,168
You're so strong for not showing how sad you are.

137
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,167
- Sad?
- You can relax.

138
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:51,746
There's no way you aren't sad about Yanase-san leaving, right?

139
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:53,895
What? He's leaving?

140
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,668
Don't play dumb.

141
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:59,350
He's going to work in Vancouver, right?

142
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:07,005
Wait, you didn't know?

143
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,178
In our remaining time,

144
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,085
we'll push hard to make the quality more realistic.

145
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,994
- Okay.
- Got it.

146
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,280
Everyone, let's do our best until the end.

147
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,357
- Yes!
- Yes!

148
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:37,086
Let's do this.

149
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:44,273
Yanase, do you have a moment?

150
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:46,174
Sure.

151
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:51,413
Kaneda, is everything okay?

152
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:53,014
Yes.

153
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,965
I think this texture is made somewhat half-heartedly.

154
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,565
Let me see.

155
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:10,185
What's wrong, Kaneda?

156
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,035
Sorry.

157
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:17,029
I'd appreciate it if you could refrain from touching me.

158
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:28,576
Sorry.

159
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:39,640
Tomoyo-san, what do I do?

160
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:42,476
Just calm down.

161
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:46,555
Tomoyo-san and I share a hobby.

162
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:11,310
Tomoyo-san, a dream couple has been formed.

163
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,827
No, Ichikawa and Iguchi aren't quite right to me.

164
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:19,378
Such a shame. I think it'd be the perfect pairing if we switched them.

165
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,562
Then I'll ask the President to switch them.

166
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:25,246
No, I've told you, haven't I?

167
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:27,433
Just watch from afar.

168
