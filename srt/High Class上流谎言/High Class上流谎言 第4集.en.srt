I'm done talking about this.

181
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,580
I want the principal to fire that coach.

182
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,420
I'll put together a new junior club team.

Hello.

185

-Good job today.
-Thank you.

But Coach.

187
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,790
Jun-hee didn't get to practice much today.

188
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,770
The thing is,
she has a tendency to go off on her own.

189
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,170
She needs to practice her passes

190
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,600
before she can play more
with the other kids.

191
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,070
-Is that so?
-Yes.

192
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,310

-See you next time, Jun-hee.
-Okay.

Mom.

195

Tell him this was the last lesson,

196
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,800
but pay him for three months as promised.

200

Do we have to fly here from Jeju
every week

201
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,110
just so you can practice passing?

202
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,250
Never forget this. You play to win.

203
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,720
And you must be the one to score.

204

You don't need to worry
about the other kids at all.

-Do as I say.

What do you mean?

211

He's just a novice coach.
Why is firing him such a big deal?

212

Who made it possible for the school
to have an ice hockey team?

You seem to have forgotten already.

So regarding the recent incident,

219
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,150
I admit that I overreacted a little.

220
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,820
We decided to just drop the whole thing.
And...

221

Our kids will stay in the club.

222
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,260
There were a few mishaps,

223

but everything got sorted out
without much trouble

224

Let's do this.

232
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,270
The purpose of the club

233
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,740
isn't just to help the kids
develop individually.

234

We're doing it so they can learn
to work and play with others

Absolutely.

We will run into bigger problems
down the road though.

238
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,850
I am concerned.

239
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,420
Well... Shall we end the meeting, then?

How can I understand this?

243
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,510
Forgive me, please.

244
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,250
I'll be honest.
I really can't bring myself

245
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,420
to pull Si-woo off the club.

246
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,160
Jun-hee has a bright future ahead of her,
but Si-woo is different.

247
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,490
Hockey is his only hope.

248

but if he leaves the team,

251
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,030
I'll have to take him to Seoul
every single time.

252
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,300
I can't do that.

253
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
Right.

254
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,810
I understand your situation.

255

spoiling the whole barrel,

I must get rid of it fast.

Yes, ma'am.
The chief producer is Kim Soo-won.

270
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,890
Call them and tell them
that Do-yeong's appearance in the show

271
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,560
would make me very uncomfortable

272
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,430
and that it'd be best for them
to do the show without her.

273
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,770
Yes, ma'am. I'll let them know.

274

Anyway, we successfully
avoided the crisis.

275

It all officially starts now.

276

You're right but will everything
be all right like this?

277
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,690
As much as he lacks,
he needs to try hard to catch up.

But he's causing trouble to others.

279
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,230
How about I teach him more
when the rink is free?

280
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,300
If he needs more practice
compared to the others,

281
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,740
all he needs is some extra lessons.

282
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,940
Really?

283
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,210
Yi-chan isn't bad at skating

284
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,240
and he has good balance.

285
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,010
He'll get better
the more he gets used to it.

Well, it's for Yi-chan, not you.

289
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,860
So you don't have to be so grateful.

290

Okay.

295
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,210
That reminds me,

296
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,740
are you still not interested in surfing?

297
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
What?

298
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,950
It's fine to be reckless once in a while.

299
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,690
I'll think about it.

300
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,830
I'm glad everything worked out well.

301
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,040
There was a lot of fuss in the beginning
but Yi-chan will do great.

302
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,740
I can't believe that mom apologized.

303
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,420
All right, I'll call you later. Okay.

304
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,700
Did you catch these all by yourself?

305
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,540
Of course, I did.

306
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,880
Why? Is it fascinating?

307
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,050
My mom is good at catching these too.

308
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,650
Really?

309
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,460
You look smart and pretty,
just like your mom.

310
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,300
Do you know my mom?

311
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,540
Your mom will worry
if you wander around here alone.

312
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,680
Jae-in! Let's go home!

313
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,310
Mom!

314
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Didn't I tell you not to talk to strangers
in places like this?

315
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,160
Thank you.

316
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,190
Let's go.

317
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,350
-Camp day?
-Yes.

318
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,880
It's a one-day sleepover at the school
with my friends and teachers.

319
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,720
We'll play and eat snacks together.

320
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,090
It's cool, right?

321
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,360
It sounds really fun.

322
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,290
But will you be all right without me?

323
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,060
It's your first time sleeping over
with friends.

324
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,500
What? I'm now old enough
to sleep over without you.

325
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,630
Really?

326
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,530
You can't say
that you want to come home at night.

327
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,900
I definitely won't.

328
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,410
What about you?
Will you be all right without me, Mom?

329
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,010
Of course not.

330
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,350
Eat up.

331
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,920
Camp Day is a tradition at our school

332
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,060
where the kids spend a night
in the school building.

333
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,590
It's to develop
the kids' independence and--

334
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,090
It's a free night for the moms.

335
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,630
We should enjoy it too.

336
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,670
It's not every day we're free
from both our husbands and kids.

337
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
A bazaar will also be held on that day.

338
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,040
Each class will be selling donations,

339
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,340
snacks, and drinks at the booths

340
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,610
set up on the school field.

341
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,080
Our restaurant's Chef Jung Mi-do

342
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,950
will be catering the event.

343
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,750
Oh, really? Oh, my. He's so cute!

344
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,820
Yeo-wool, I heard this event is popular
even outside of our school.

345
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,360
Really?

346
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,890
Since the school moms are quite classy

347
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,000
and they're very enthusiastic
when it comes to school events.

348
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,870
Look at them right now.

349
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,100
We need to divide roles for our class too.

350
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,010
I'd like to participate too.

351
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,450
Well...

352
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,620
You don't have any experience
in such events.

353
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,050
Will you be all right?

354
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,420
Experience doesn't necessarily
equal skills.

355
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,160
Then take charge of the goodie bags
that will be handed out after the event.

356
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,130
Don't worry too much about the items.

357
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,230
Just a simple one
that won't be overwhelming.

358
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,770
You get it, right?

359
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,240
I do.

360
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,560
What is it? Are you looking for something?

361
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,660
No.

362
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,090
By the way, what should I do?
I did volunteer but...

363
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,130
-Do you feel pressured?
-Of course.

364
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,270
Come on, Yeo-wool.
You were full of confidence earlier.

365
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,940
I was, right?

366
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,840
Don't think too much about it.

367
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,070
Snacks and toys for the kids
should be enough.

368
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,310
Okay.

369
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,860
Yeo-wool, how about we fill in

370
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,730
the goodie bags
with seasonal fruits from here?

371
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,960
These are seasonal fruits
grown in the best condition.

372
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,870
Summer tangerines are in season right now.
You can make marmalade out of them.

373
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,430
That's a good idea
but will I be able to do it alone?

374
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,500
It's quite a lot of work.

375
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,370
It won't be that hard
if we do it together.

376
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,940
Really? You're the best.

377
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
Thanks.

378
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,420
It'll be meaningful
since it's homemade clean food,

379
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,080
and if the marmalade isn't enough,

380
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,620
we can juice them and deep-fry them

381
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,690
to make traditional hangwa.

382
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,590
If you deep-fry flour
with a bit of honey or starch syrup

383
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,290
and summer tangerines,

384
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,890
it's sweet and savory.

385
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,130
Sounds delicious.

386
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,360
My mom used to make it for me
when I was little.

387
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,100
That's a great idea. Let's try it.

388
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,640
Sir, how much are the summer tangerines?

389
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,340
We're going to order a lot.

390
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,770
-I'll give you a discount.
-Thank you.

391
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,740
How about these?

392
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,080
These ones and ones that are ripe.

393
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,750
-All of these.
-Please give us a mix of these two.

394
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,580
-Here.
-Give us a mix of small and big ones.

395
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,070
It's not easy to choose
since the bazaar is supposed to be classy.

396
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,430
Which one should I take?

397
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,790
Do you like it?

398
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,820
Wow, it's so pretty.

399
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,130
It reminded me of you the moment I saw it.

400
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,330
But it must've been really expensive.

401
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,600
It wasn't. It's your first birthday
after we got married.

402
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,030
That bag is the least I could do.

403
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,300
And you shouldn't put a price
on a man's gift.

404
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,840
-Thank you, honey.
-Don't mention it. It's fake anyway.

405
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,310
What? My goodness.

406
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,250
Let's eat.

407
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,280
You can be mean.

408
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,550
It's almost ten years already.

409
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,730
[The phone number
you have requested to check]

410
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,700
[Oh Soon-sang]

411
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,300
[was an untraceable burner phone.]

412
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
[The text message history
could not be checked.]

413
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,610
A burner phone?

414
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,610
Why would he use a burner phone?

415
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,980
[What about the flowers?
Did you find out who they were from?]

416
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,550
[Oh]

417
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,190
[I'm looking into the local shops.]

418
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,830
[Please check with the hotel
if it's connected to Nam Ji-seon.]

419
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,990
[Oh]

420
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,500
[I'll get back to you
as soon as I find out.]

421
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,350
I don't have any clothes.
I mean, I'm a celebrity.

422
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,990
You're a 300-piece
limited designer edition.

423
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,090
I can't sell you.

424
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,730
I can't sell you either.
You're the dress for the year-end party.

425
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,370
I'm lost.

426
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,600
What do I do?

427
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,340
All right.

428
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,340
It's sad, but I'm afraid

429
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,710
we have to say goodbye now.

430
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,990
Goodness. Is this really all I have?

431
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,060
I should go shopping.

432
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,030
Well, as you all know,
tomorrow is Camp Day.

433
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,200
It's a day to learn
HSC's mindset and attitude

434
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,830
by spending one night at school
with your friends.

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,840
You're not kindergarteners anymore, right?

436
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,610
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

437
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,510
Okay. You can bring anything you want
besides what you need.

438
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,780
For example, dolls, pictures...

439
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,880
Yes, Jae-in?

440
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,620
Can I possibly go home
in the middle of camping?

441
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,790
No.

442
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,820
Unless you're sick or something happens.

443
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,590
She says I can't.

444
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,930
But I've never slept alone.

445
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,500
Me neither.

446
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,130
-Then should we stay together?
-Sure.

447
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,300
What are you talking about...

448
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,610
It's a croissant sandwich.

449
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,180
It's made with sliced smoked ham
from Germany,

450
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,920
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese from Italy,

451
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,690
and organic tomatoes grown in Korea.

452
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,320
Smoked ham might smell too strong
for the kids.

453
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,660
-Replace it.
-Yes, ma'am.

454
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,970
Make sure to dice the vegetables
that go into the rice balls

455
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,470
more finely,

456
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,300
-so the kids don't choke on them.
-Yes, ma'am.

457
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,410
Did you make sure all dishes are nut-free?

458
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,640
And are all eggs
organic and antibiotic-free?

459
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,710
I checked all the ingredients
and the entire cooking process thoroughly.

460
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,780
Make sure all preparations are
finished on time.

461
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,550
The preparations should begin
at least an hour before.

462
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,220
Everything must go as planned.

463
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,130
There will be a delivery from
Seoul Department Store this afternoon.

464
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,530
-Check everything thoroughly.
-Yes, ma'am.

465
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,760
What's being delivered?

466
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,130
Goody bags to be handed out
after the event.

467
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,440
Oh, my goodness.

468
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,280
You live in this gorgeous house?

469
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,080
You have no idea.

470
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,280
It's extremely drafty. And we've even
seen snakes in our bedrooms.

471
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,750
My gosh. Snakes?

472
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,790
I think you're so brave.

473
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,020
This is pretty far from the school.

474
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,590
That's the whole point.

475
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,790
I didn't want to hang out
with the other moms all the time.

476
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,930
You're an exception though.

477
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,200
Anyway, this is really nice.

478
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,990
That's too thick.

479
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,550
Slice them more thinly. Like this.

480
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,190
Oh, I got it.

481
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,460
I do have the basic skills at least.

482
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh, my. Is it bad?

483
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,930
No, I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

484
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,300
I'll admit it. I'm terrible at housework.

485
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,070
-My goodness.
-Thank you.

486
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,640
It's just a scratch. Don't worry.

487
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,110
I feel so bad.

488
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,080
It's okay.

489
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,720
I'll do it.

490
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,630
-Are you okay?
-Of course. Don't worry.

491
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,670
Now that I think of it,

492
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,140
I haven't had any everyday life.

493
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,380
Cooking, cleaning, doing the laundry...

494
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,410
Time spent on doing
those things, you know.

495
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,120
I've been so swamped in work

496
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,920
that I never even got to learn
how to use a knife.

497
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,560
You can do those things now.

498
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,930
My kid's become so big,

499
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,760
but I feel like there's nothing I can do.

500
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,700
Because I feel so impatient,
these things keep happening.

501
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,100
You're a good mom.

502
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,170
You're doing well.

503
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,510
Otherwise, why would Yi-chan
like you so much?

504
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,350
That actually really comforts me.

505
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,300
I told the housekeeper
how to prepare your meals.

506
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Don't skip meals
just because you're alone.

507
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,600
Okay.

508
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,870
Also, I know you're busy,
but try to get to know

509
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,810
the other dads.

510
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,340
They're all successful in their fields.

511
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,679
Don't you think
this is such a nice opportunity?

512
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,650
Doctors tend to keep to themselves.

513
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,820
But running a clinic is a business too.

514
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,020
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry too much.

515
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,000
Unbelievable.

516
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,460
Jun-mo, can I try it?

517
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,070
Please let me.

518
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,800
What's this?

519
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,600
It's a present from his dad in Seoul.

520
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,370
It's his birthday next week.

521
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,210
Jun-mo, please let me try it. Please?

522
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,120
Jun-mo, explain what happened.

523
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,449
A birthday present?

524
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,790
You don't know what it is?

525
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,360
I told you you can't have one of these.

526
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,920
It's too dangerous.

527
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,460
You should've asked Mom and Dad first.

528
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,360
Who's my dad?

529
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,220
Mr. An.

530
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,800
My mom is giving you a hard time, right?

531
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,670
There you go. Okay.

532
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,810
What else? Is this everything?

533
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,410
Yes.

534
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:51,040
Mom, what are you going to do
while I'm away?

535
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,680
I'm going to play with Jae-in's mom.

536
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,980
Are you going to have fun without me?

537
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,050
No way. I'll miss you so much

538
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
that I won't be able to sleep.

539
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,360
Come on. That's not okay.
You're a grown-up.

540
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,630
Come here, my boy.

541
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,470
You really are all grown up.
You can even sleep away from me.

542
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,640
Have a good night with your friends.
I'll see you tomorrow.

543
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,810
Okay. Don't cry even if you miss me.

544
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,310
Okay.

545
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
Let's go.

546
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,510
Oh, I forgot the first-aid kit.
Give me a second.

547
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:13,290
Oh, my goodness.

548
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,360
Are you okay?

549
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,360
Are you moving or something?

550
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,400
I'm fine now. Thank you.

551
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,170
Give me those. I can't trust you.

552
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,810
What are all these?

553
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,310
They're gifts to hand out.
There was a lot to prepare.

554
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,080
You're always struggling on your own.

555
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,190
I know.
I've never been a full-time mom before.

556
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,320
And I have no husband
or anyone to help me.

557
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,460
I feel like a madwoman every day.

558
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,930
But at least you seem to be
full of energy.

559
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,690
I do have a lot of energy.

560
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes, a bit too much.

561
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,270
You make other people worry.

562
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,240
Is that a compliment?

563
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,140
You decide.

564
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,070
Goodness.

565
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,720
My, this looks like a hotel buffet.

566
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,240
Yes, ma'am.

567
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,110
-You're early.
-I guess so.

568
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,340
-Is this it?
-Yes. Here.

569
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,680
-Is it homemade?
-I thought it'd be better for the kids.

570
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,220
Thank you for this.

571
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,190
You can leave these with me.

572
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,870
Do you have anything more to say?

573
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,470
No.

574
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,250
Hey!

575
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,220
Hey, sweetie.

576
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,920
Seriously, we can't.

577
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,430
But no one's here.

578
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,930
What if people come in?

579
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
People don't know
what's hidden in plain sight.

580
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,170
This is a rare opportunity.

581
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,700
That woman knows too.
We need to be extra careful for now.

582
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,770
You know her too.

583
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,710
She doesn't know it's me yet.

584
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,940
But, still!

585
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,110
So?

586
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,750
Do you not like it?

587
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,750
Seriously, I need to get going.

588
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,560
Do you mind closing your eyes?

589
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,530
Open your mouth.

590
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,660
Toys!

591
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,530
It's empty here.

592
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,630
You did say that.

593
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,010
Yi-chan, take a look at this.

594
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,510
-Look. It's pretty, right?
-It is.

595
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,080
An Yi-chan, what did you bring?

596
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
-Your mom's scarf?
-Yes.

597
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,820
It smells like Mom when I sniff it.

598
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,030
What else did you bring?

599
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,600
What is this?
They're just like little kids.

600
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,840
Right?

601
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,670
An Yi-chan, do you miss your mom already?

602
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,170
Mommy!

603
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,010
I miss you!

604
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,310
Boo!

605
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,480
Don't let them bother you.

606
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,850
Oh, right. Do you want some of these?

607
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,660
Here.

608
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,630
What is that? What are you eating?

609
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,740
Do you want some?

610
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,420
What is this weird looking thing?

611
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,790
Give me some too.

612
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,630
Where did you get this?

613
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,470
My mom made it for me.

614
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,570
Really?

615
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,400
Do you have more?

616
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,680
Okay, see you! Bye!

617
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,450
-Hey, Si-woo's mom!
-Oh, my.

618
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,080
It's like a high-end
second-hand shop here.

619
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,290
There's a reason
our school bazaar is famous.

620
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,090
Someone I know got herself

621
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,060
a Picotin bag last year at this bazaar.
Just for 200,000 won.

622
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh, my. Only 200,000 won?

623
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,200
Wasn't it fake?

624
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,630
Come on, how can someone bring a fake?

625
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,540
This event has some standards.

626
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,040
Everyone is scanning everything
like hawks here.

627
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,470
Right?

628
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,680
Yeo-wool, how's this? It's pretty.

629
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,520
It's actually mine.

630
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,190
Really?

631
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,390
It's a gift from my husband
a long time ago.

632
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,090
I thought it's time for me to move on.

633
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,800
That bag is one of my most precious ones.

634
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,370
It's quite old

635
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,140
but it's an A-class item

636
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,940
and it goes well with the retro trend.

637
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,870
How about it? Buy it.

638
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,440
But there's the same bag here.

639
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,480
Hold on.

640
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,720
Oh, my gosh. This is fake.

641
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,330
Really?

642
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,630
No way!

643
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,170
I can't tell at all.

644
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,900
I have a real one.

645
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,510
The surface texture

646
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,610
and stitching details...

647
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,780
I can immediately tell
from just touching it.

648
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,150
Even if it's an A-class item
or an exact replica,

649
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,850
a fake is still a fake.

650
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,620
Who on earth donated this?

651
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,920
Throw that away right this instant.

652
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,390
I reminded you numerous times
to check the items' condition thoroughly.

653
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,990
Who accepted this?

654
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,230
My gosh. I did.

655
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,510
But both Si-woo's mom
and Yi-chan's mom brought the same bag.

656
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,940
Me?

657
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,150
Don't be ridiculous! This one's mine.

658
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,320
Ji-seon, do you really think
I'm crazy enough to bring a fake here?

659
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,190
Does that mean it's yours, Yi-chan's mom?

660
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,420
-What?
-You really put me on the spot.

661
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,960
Have you thought of how I'd look,

662
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,860
as the hostess of this event,
if you submit that kind of item here?

663
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,100
Why would you think
that the fake one is mine?

664
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,740
There's no way my husband
would've gifted me a fake one.

665
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,670
I'll just buy both of them.

666
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,540
I don't really care.

667
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,340
What do you think you're doing?

668
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,850
Whether it's fake or not,

669
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,510
isn't it fine as long as the person
who's using it is happy?

670
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,950
They look the same to me.

671
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,490
I'll use them well.

672
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,090
Ji-seon, wait for me!

673
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,230
That'll be 100,000 won.

674
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,870
They're still second-hand after all.

675
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,270
They'll probably even like trash
if it's from a high-end brand.

676
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,310
You're right. It's all a bit baffling.

677
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,120
[Oh Soon-sang]

678
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,620
[The flowers were sent
from Locanda Jeju flower shop.]

679
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,320
[The sender can't be identified
due to the hotel's privacy policy.]

680
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,090
If it's Locanda Jeju...

681
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,260
I knew it.

682
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,830
What's wrong, Yeo-wool?

683
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,960
-I have to step out. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

684
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,510
What? Didn't you say
it was in the catering section?

685
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,940
Where is it?

686
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,580
Is that it?

687
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,710
Seems like it.

688
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,180
Is this really it?

689
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,550
This is it, right?

690
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,990
Yes.

691
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,030
Of course.

692
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,240
-It's a great help.
-Yes. We're grateful too.

693
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,500
Yes.

694
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,070
-Yes.
-Then...

695
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,340
-Hello.
-Hello.

696
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,340
Ms. Nam, we need to talk.

697
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,150
We'll take our leave.

698
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,830
Everything I brought was in the trash.

699
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,930
What happened?

700
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,730
Don't worry.

701
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,070
I changed the goodie bags
to the ones I prepared just in case.

702
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:57,300
-What?
-It was inevitable.

703
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,040
What if the kids
get sick from eating them?

704
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,640
Get sick?

705
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,550
You don't seem to know

706
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,620
how harmful excessive intake
of sugar and gluten is for kids.

707
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,050
It not only causes cavities
but also decreases bone density,

708
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,190
increases blood sugar levels,

709
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,760
affects emotional stability,
sleep, and concentration,

710
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,890
as well as causes childhood obesity.
The list is endless.

711
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,830
We thoroughly limit sugar intake
at our house too.

712
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,630
I didn't prepare something inedible.

713
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,340
I'm also a mom raising a kid.

714
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,440
It might be fine in your household

715
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,040
but I can't let my kids eat
some random food.

716
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,440
Random food?

717
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,940
Did you just say random food?

718
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,420
What are you two talking about?

719
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,680
Let me in on it too.

720
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,520
Let's continue our talk
after the event is over.

721
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,700
So, that's it. Let's do that.

722
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,870
It could be because it's dark in here,
but you look extra stunning today.

723
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,440
Would you like something to drink?

724
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,510
No. Let's talk now.

725
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,810
I get the picture now.

726
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,110
You hated me from the get-go.

727
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,850
Was it because of my husband?

728
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,550
-Come again?
-He's my husband.

729
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,490
Don't you think
your behavior is unacceptable?

730
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,530
What are you talking about?

731
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,330
How dare you...

732
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,200
It was you.

733
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,630
The flowers and texts.

734
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,800
The one who has been harassing us.

735
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,110
Mom.

736
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,110
Si-woo! Why are you roaming around here?

737
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,180
No! That's not it.

738
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,720
Jun-hee is...

739
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,150
Jun-hee? What about her?

740
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,460
Over there.

741
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,970
Jun-hee! What are you doing?

742
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,500
Spit it out right now. Spit it out!

743
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,470
Spit it out! Now!

744
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,740
-Now!
-My gosh.

745
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,680
-Spit it out!
-What happened?

746
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,810
She has atopic dermatitis and allergies.

747
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:22,450
Please call an ambulance.

748
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,480
-If she goes into anaphylactic shock--
-The hospital is an hour away.

749
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,250
Let's take her to the infirmary.

750
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,990
They can administer first aid.

751
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,090
Let's go.

752
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,660
Excuse us. Coming through. Excuse us!

753
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,190
-My gosh.
-I hope she's okay.

754
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,670
She's atopic. She had dessert earlier

755
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,840
and threw everything up just now.

756
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,880
-I have to take her to the hospital--
-She's okay.

757
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,880
She didn't have
any atopic or allergic reactions.

758
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,580
That can't be.

759
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,480
Please re-examine her carefully.

760
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,590
Kids can develop immunity to allergies
as they mature.

761
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,150
Then why did she vomit?

762
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,720
That was probably caused
by the sudden overeating.

763
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,090
I suggest you let her eat snacks
from time to time.

764
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:12,030
This can happen
when kids are banned from snacking.

765
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,500
Doctor, I think you got it wrong.

766
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:18,970
If you don't trust me,
you can take her to a big hospital.

767
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,240
She's fine, so she can leave
once she's feeling better.

768
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,790
I'm glad she's okay.

769
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,230
How dare you make my kid eat garbage?

770
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,590
Ma'am. Please calm down.

771
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,360
Do your job, will you?

772
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,970
I told you to throw away the garbage.
You should've thrown it out!

773
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,370
My apologies, ma'am.

774
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,640
Your husband duped people
and took his own life.

775
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,370
And your kid is a bully.

776
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,240
Know your place.
I'm done putting up with you.

777
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,480
And what did you say earlier?

778
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,280
He's your husband?

779
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,180
What do you take me for?

780
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,990
I'm done condoning this ridiculousness.

781
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,720
Leave while I'm still being nice.

782
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,790
You're right.

783
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,230
My husband killed himself.

784
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,360
People pointed their fingers at me,

785
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,170
but I moved here with my son
to go on living.

786
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,340
But who are you to tell me to leave?

787
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,870
Do you have the right to do that?

788
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,380
This is my son's school.
No matter what happens, I can't leave.

789
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,550
I will not leave.

790
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,910
Fine.

791
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,820
Let's see who wins.

792
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,750
I'll file a formal complaint
with the PTA and the board

793
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,390
and contest your son's enrollment,
so you'd better be prepared.

794
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,960
Wake Jun-hee up. We're going home.

795
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,720
Here, take this.

796
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,290
At least put this on your face.

797
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,490
If you don't get the swelling down now,
you'll get a bruise.

798
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,330
It's okay.

799
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,400
Are you going to see Yi-chan tomorrow
with a bruise on your face?

800
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,370
Injuries are my specialty,
so just listen to me.

801
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,240
Wait. It's okay. I'll do it.

802
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,960
This is really cold.

803
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,030
Here. This time,
I didn't randomly find it on the ground.

804
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,640
Thank you.

805
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,850
Don't act so tough
just because you have the energy to do so.

806
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,180
You can't be full of energy
every single day.

807
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,250
It'll wear you out.

808
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:25,360
Cry and let yourself break down
here and there.

809
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,490
I'll look the other way.

810
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,010
I'm really sorry.

811
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,150
I stepped in to help,
but I shouldn't have.

812
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,120
Don't say that. I wouldn't have been able
to deal with it on my own.

813
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,360
Are you all right?

814
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,870
I'm so pathetic and embarrassed.

815
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,070
What? Why?

816
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,100
I feel like I ruined everything.

817
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:16,510
To think there was something going on
between my husband and that woman,

818
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,440
I couldn't stand it anymore.

819
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,350
He's dead and gone.
Why did I even think that?

820
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,420
I suspected him.

821
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,320
I thought everything
that has happened here

822
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,220
could be related to him somehow.

823
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,990
I'm so stupid, aren't I?

824
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,530
Everyone is like that.

825
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,770
So don't kick yourself too much.

826
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,470
Forget the past.
Let's think only about the future.

827
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,810
Yes, I should.

828
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,620
I have to say, I'm so glad.

829
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,880
-Why?
-That I have you.

830
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,990
Thanks.

831
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,560
Anyway, I've been talking
too much about myself.

832
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,830
Tell me about yourself.

833
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,130
What did you do before you moved here?

834
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,940
Me? I was...

835
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,050
Don't you have someone like that?

836
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:32,880
Someone you wish would die.

837
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,920
People already say
that I killed my husband.

838
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,030
Did you really kill him?

839
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,480
What about you? Why?

840
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,280
There's someone I want to kill.

841
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,500
Yeo-wool, let's go for a dip.

842
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,100
What? Wait.

843
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
My gosh, Na-yoon. Hold on!

844
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,440
Gosh, hold on.

845
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,050
Wait! My clothes are soaked.

846
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,180
My gosh! Stop it.

847
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,420
-Yeo-wool!
-It's cold!

848
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,490
My gosh! Hold on.

849
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,030
Goodness.

850
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,300
Stop. Please stop.

851
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,740
That was fun.

852
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,180
-That was so fun.
-That really cooled me down.

853
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,510
Yeo-wool, can I sleep over tonight?

854
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,180
You want to?

855
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:12,650
Sure, why not?

856
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:41,780
It's been a while.

857
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,650
Thank you for finally meeting with me.

858
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,650
Have a seat.

859
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,740
I don't understand.

860
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,070
Why do you have to push me this far?

861
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:11,380
Why did you bring her here?

862
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,810
I understand how you feel.

863
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,550
But given the situation,
there was no better option.

864
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,350
Do you know what happened
to Jun-hee today?

865
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,790
She shouldn't have been accepted here
in the first place.

866
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,090
My patience has run out.

867
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,800
Ms. Nam.

868
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,770
You do know what kind of situation

869
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,770
you and the foundation are in right now,
don't you?

870
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,810
Whether you like it or not,
we're in the same boat now.

871
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,510
And we both need that woman.

872
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,680
-Ms. Doh.
-Until this matter is resolved,

873
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,420
please trust me and wait.

874
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,600
[Don't you have someone like that?]

875
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:51,910
[Someone you wish would die.]

876
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,250
What's wrong, Yeo-wool?

877
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,380
-I have to step out. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

878
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,640
[With love, your husband, Ji-yong]

879
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,510
[With love, your husband, Ji-yong.]

880
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,640
Murderer.

881
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,360
[High Class]

882
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,720
Dad?

883
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,360
We'll keep this a secret.

884
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,030
[Wouldn't it be so fun to surprise them?]

885
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,230
-It's a secret.
[-Never let your guard down.]

886
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,330
[I might get aggressive at any minute.]

887
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,740
[Is there a way to kick her out?]

888
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,970
I'll face it head-on.
I never fight a losing battle.

889
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,570
[She's just a lawyer with no connections.]

890
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,240
[What can she possibly do on her own?]

891
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:46,480
[You deliberately covered up
the accident.]

892
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:49,510
[What do you want me to do?]

893
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:52,980
[In an unfamiliar place,
beware of the one closest to you.]
