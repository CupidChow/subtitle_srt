-That'd be great.

327
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,090
Yes.

328
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,060
We've been a bit unfriendly so far.

329
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,360
Well, we can all
get to know each other from now on.

330
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,470
I hope we get along.

331
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,140
-Let's toast. Cheers!
-Cheers!

332
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,140
That reminds me,
it's the kids' music festival soon.

333
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,210
I heard practice started on Monday.

334
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,710
Noah is playing the cello.

335
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,650
-Yu-bin is playing the violin.
-Jae-in is playing the violin too.

336
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,220
What about Yi-chan?

337
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,790
The orchestra never crossed our minds.

338
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,160
But he doesn't know
how to play any instruments.

339
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,030
So he's in charge of the cymbals.

340
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,530
The cymbals?
My Si-woo is playing the drums.

341
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,570
I took him to famous music classes
ever since he was little

342
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,470
and taught him all sorts of instruments
from piano and flute to violin.

343
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,710
But he's just not good at classical music.

344
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,540
So I'm thinking of teaching him
the drums later on.

345
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,810
He's not that bad at hitting things.

346
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,050
Starting music lessons at a young age

347
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,920
is a compulsory subject
in teaching them humanism.

348
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,220
Their concentration and endurance will
improve if they stick to it. Right?

349
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,560
Right, concentration.

350
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,460
And also,

351
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,700
grade one is going to make the opening
speech at this year's festival.

352
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,270
That's going to be cute!

353
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,440
Hold on.
Is Jun-hee going to make the speech?

354
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,280
Not alone.

355
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,980
It's a duo...

356
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,620
with Jae-in.

357
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,120
Jae-in's mom
brought her daughter up really well.

358
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,730
She's got a long way
to catch up to Jun-hee.

359
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,530
What's this, Jae-in's mom?
Is this how you're going to push through?

360
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,630
It's not like that.

361
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,140
Excuse me for a minute.

362
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,250
What's going on?

363
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,960
[Women]

364
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,360
Thank you for keeping your word.

365
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,300
What's going on between you
and Yi-chan's mom?

366
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,100
You two seemed close.

367
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm not sure.

368
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,140
But I don't have friends to begin with.

369
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,240
How interesting.

370
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,810
It's none of my business,

371
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,950
but this is all I can do to help you.

372
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,710
The rest is up to you.

373
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,650
But you know what'll happen

374
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,190
if you drag Jun-hee down.

375
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,120
Don't worry. That will never happen.

376
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,990
-Shall we have another round of drinks?
-Sure!

377
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,200
We're all going
for the second round, right?

378
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,300
Where's Yi-chan's mom?

379
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,940
She wasn't feeling well,
so she left not too long ago.

380
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm glad she knows when to butt out.

381
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,080
Why are you leaving already?

382
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,380
I forgot Jae-in has a lesson today.

383
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,790
I'll get going first.

384
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,730
Anyway, gives us some details
about what's going on, Ji-seon.

385
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,760
What's with Jae-in's mom all of a sudden?
What are you planning?

386
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,100
There's a saying.

387
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,400
Use your enemy's hand to catch a snake.

388
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,940
So you're going to use
your enemy's hands to catch a snake?

389
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,610
We'll have to see
if she's an enemy or an ally.

390
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,480
You've been bringing out
rats, cats, and snakes since last time.

391
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,280
This isn't some kind of zoo!

392
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,020
Use words I can understand.

393
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm already stressed out by
all the English at the kids' school.

394
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,890
Seriously.

395
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,630
One more glass!

396
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,760
Really. I should've studied English.

397
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,970
Ms. Song!

398
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,470
My gosh, Chef Jung.

399
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,610
I'm surprised to run into you here.

400
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,780
-Right.
-What brings you here?

401
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,820
I'm here with the other moms.

402
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,320
You never called. I'm glad to see you.

403
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,220
Oh, I'm sorry. I was meaning to drop by,

404
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,660
but I've been too busy.

405
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,060
Speaking of which, how about right now?

406
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,330
Right now?

407
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,570
Thank you for this.

408
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,740
Like I said, I've been looking forward
to treating you.

409
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,060
It was a year ago today, right?
Your anniversary.

410
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,740
Montrachet.
It's a Chardonnay from Burgundy.

411
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,340
It was Mr. An's favorite.

412
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,640
In France, they call it
the wine of paradise.

413
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,350
It's perfect for this kind of
weather and season.

414
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,400
You remember everything.

415
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,730
I assumed you needed to talk
to somebody on a day like this.

416
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,840
I apologize if I made you uncomfortable.

417
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,570
Not at all.

418
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,980
It's just that I don't know what to do.

419
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,780
I can neither remember him nor forget him.

420
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,120
I can't believe it's already been a year.

421
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,430
-Were you that hungry?
-Yes.

422
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
That dress was suffocating me.

423
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,900
I can finally breathe now.

424
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,100
Congratulations on your anniversary.

425
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,240
Thank you.

426
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,340
How do you like the food?

427
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,240
It couldn't be more perfect.

428
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,510
What about you?
We haven't dined here in a while.

429
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,280
I'm trying to savor every bite.

430
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,950
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

431
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,590
Please let me know
if you need anything more.

432
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,790
We will.

433
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,860
We haven't done this in so long.
I want to do this properly.

434
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,090
Let's clink glasses.

435
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,870
Honey. This isn't the end.

436
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,040
[That was our last dinner together.]

437
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,950
Come to think of it,

438
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,880
he barely touched his dinner that day.

439
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,750
But I didn't notice it.

440
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,760
I'm sorry I'm being all gloomy
in front of food.

441
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,690
Don't worry.

442
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,130
By the way,

443
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,830
I'm not sure if I should tell you this
after all this time,

444
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,070
but it's about Mr. An.

445
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,510
I saw him with someone that day
before you came.

446
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,640
He was with someone?

447
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,640
Are you kidding me?

448
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,810
This doesn't make any sense!

449
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,580
Are you serious?

450
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,320
You can't go back on your word now.

451
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,260
I couldn't see the face well,
but I think it was a woman.

452
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,190
A woman?

453
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,590
The atmosphere was quite heavy.

454
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
You didn't seem to know about it,

455
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,800
so I kept quiet.

456
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,840
But I had a feeling that I should tell you
even if it's too late.

457
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,410
I see.

458
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,580
Thank you for telling me.

Thank you again.

461
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,890
I really enjoyed the food.

462
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,760
See you again.
Next time, how about dinner?

463
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,960

Sweetheart. When did you get here?

467
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,820
I came to see you,
but the two of you seemed so lovey-dovey.

468
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,990
Come on, it wasn't like that.

469
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,590
What's going on between you two?

470
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,290
Why were you with her alone at this hour?

471
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,930
I just treated her to a meal.

472
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,230
Just a meal?

473
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,730
She was my regular in Seoul.

474
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,270
Now that we met here again,
I couldn't pretend we were strangers.

475
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,870
Hold on.
Don't tell me you're suspecting me.

whether it was just a meal
or there was something more?

What?

480
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,550
Then explain what this is.

You dropped it.

Well, I want to surprise my girlfriend.

488
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,480

489

Oh, my. How do you have this?

525
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,110
Yi-chan dropped it at Camp Day.

526
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,280
It seemed important.

527

535
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,070
Well, it's no big deal.

536
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,710
I'm sure it is.

537
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,440
Let's say

538
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,320
I found out my best friend
was deceiving me.

539
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,350
It breaks my heart

540
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,450
but if I confront her,
I'd lose her as a friend.

541
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,190
What would you do?

542
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,260
I'm not sure.

543
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,370
But if I were you, I wouldn't ask her.

544
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,800
She must have her own reasons

545
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,110
and even if you confront her, there's no
guarantee she'll tell you the truth.

546
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,710
And at times,

547
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,310
you need friends more than the truth.

548
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,220
But if it's like that,
can I really call her a friend?

549
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,790
You'll find out soon enough,

550

whether she's a friend or not.

551

Lies are bound
to be revealed anytime soon.

552

And it's up to your heart

00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,420
But she never came out.

812
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,320
Ma'am, please calm down.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

813
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,260
We're checking the CCTV
in the entire school right now.

814
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,760
We'll be able to find her in no time.

815
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,030
I found her.

816
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,430
She's leaving with someone.

827
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,610
How could you take my kid away
without saying anything to me?

828
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,220
Let me talk to Jae-in right now.

829
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,720
Are you sure
you still don't have anything to tell me?

830
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,760
-Suit yourself.
-Hold on.

831
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,130
I'll tell you.

832
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,600
I'll tell you everything.
Please don't do this.

833
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,200
Okay. I'll be right there.
Give me just a second.

834
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:12,000
Ma'am, should we report to the police?

835
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,840
We've found her, so you don't have to.
Thank you.

836

Jae-in! Hwang Jae-in!

839
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,480
Where's my daughter? Where is she?

840
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,420
Don't worry. She's having a good time.

841
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,720
So how do you feel?

842
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,220
You stole my husband.

843
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,560
And I stole your kid for a second.
How do you feel now?

844
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,930
I was going to trust you no matter what.

845
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,760
I thought you were the only person
who was kind to me.

846
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,970
But what is this?
Was it your doing all along?

847
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,440
The incident at the reception,

848
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,510
the text, the flowers, all of them?

849
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,240
How could you...

850
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,880
Are you even human?

851
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,080
How could you do that?

852
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,350
It took you long enough,
Ms. Song Yeo-wool.

853
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,490
Do you really not know why I did that?

854
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,590
I know

855
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,830
you killed him.

856
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,400
Admit it.

857
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,910
Is that why?

858
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,180
He would

859
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,510
never have killed himself like that.

860
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,950
What exactly happened that day?

861
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,020
Tell me.

862
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,990
You and I both lost our husband.

863
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,230
So why am I the only one?

864
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,330
Get out of here right now,

865
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,430
or I'll sue you for adultery

866
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,400
and tell your daughter everything.

867
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:26,040
You'll have to compensate me
for my mental and economic damages

868
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,840
and be punished for blackmailing me.

869
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,940
You and your daughter will never
be able to set foot here again.

870
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,410
Are you telling me to leave?

871
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,510
Why?

872
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,320
What makes you so sure
that you were first?

873
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,750
Does it ever occur to you
that you may not have been?

874
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,960
-What?
-The painting in your study.

875
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,630
The painting?

876
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,260
[It was my first present to him.]

877
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
[It was long before he met you.]

878
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,930
That's nonsense.

879
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,860
I was first.

880
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,830
I'm not the one who stole him. You did.

881
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:04,600
-You're being ridiculous.
-I'm sure you can't believe it.

882
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,940
But Jae-in is his daughter.

883
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,140
She was born before your son.

884
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,580
She deserves more.

885
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:16,980
I'll make sure she gets everything
she deserves but has never gotten.

886
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,290
So if any of us has to leave,
it'll be you.

887

[High Class]

888
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,220
[Be careful.
I won't get stabbed in the back twice.]

889
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,960
Do you think you're a match for me?

890
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,160
Something's definitely going on,
don't you think?

891

[In my line of work, a background check
on clients is a must.]

[Letter of Resignation]

893
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:39,260
I found quite some dirt on you.

[Did An Ji-yong put you in this position?]

895
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,640
[Now that I met you again,]

896
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,670
