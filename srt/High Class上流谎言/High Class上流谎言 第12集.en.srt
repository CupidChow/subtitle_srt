Mr. Oh Soon-sang?

Did you kill the chairman?

By spiking her drink?

178

No, I didn't.

179
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,300
Then why did we find this in your house?

180
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,240
This is completely different from before.

181
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,440
You'll be charged with murder.

You've got an accomplice, don't you?

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,080
You don't have the motive
to do that to the chairman.

Tell me. Is it Song Yeo-wool?

186
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,960
I want my lawyer.

They did a background check on me.

And the pill bottle. Why do you have it?

194

Actually...

195
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,920
I found it at your place.

Why are you telling me only now?

202
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,790
I didn't know what was going on back then.

203
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,520
You were also at the police station.

204
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,430
I didn't think it was a good idea to talk
about it when you were having a hard time

205
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,130
with what Yi-chan went through and all.

206
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,470
So I took it with me

207
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,270
to look into it myself.

208
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,470
Didn't I tell you
to step out of this case?

209
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,910
I should tell you the same.

Stop getting involved in this.

211
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,650
What are you saying?
This all happened because of me.

It's my problem, and it's my fault.

213

I'm going to do the same.

who did that to the chairman,

229

that he left the pill bottle at my house.

An important business partner from abroad
purchased this house,

so I came here with her.

It's not as spacious as I thought.

300

It doesn't matter.

301
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm only going to use it
as a second house anyway.

302
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,340
So I need to take a look around.

303
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,570
Sure.

304
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,840
Hold on.

305

I mean, who is this woman?

What is she doing in my house?

307

Who is this?

311
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,760
Is she a housekeeper?

312
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,160

313
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,100
Well... Don't you recognize me?

I'm quite well known throughout Asia.

320

Please calm down, both of you.

321

It seems like there's been
some miscommunication.
