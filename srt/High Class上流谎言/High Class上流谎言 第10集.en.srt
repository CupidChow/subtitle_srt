because of what happened last night.


162
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,040
He can't speak.


163
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,550
The doctor says it's temporary,
but I don't know what will happen.


164
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,560
Don't worry too much.


165
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,990
He'll recover soon,


166
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,430
as if nothing happened.


167
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,300
You think so?


168
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,640
I think it was when I was about seven.


169
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,710
I suddenly couldn't speak


170
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,840
when my dog died unexpectedly.


171
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,810
I think it lasted about a month or so,


172
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,350
if my memory serves me correctly.


173
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,880
Really?


174
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,350
Yes. And look at me now.


175
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,490
As you can see, I'm totally fine.


176
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,190
I'm so healthy.


177
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,960
Yi-chan will be fine too.


178
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,500
I really hope so.


179
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,430
I'm not surprised though
because it must've been so hard for him.


180
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,940
After what happened to his dad,


181
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,100
he had to go through all that
at his new school.


182
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,980
And with his mom
going in and out of the police station...


183
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,350
With what happened last night


184
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,620
and now this too...
Did you get any sleep last night?


185
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,850
It's fine.


186
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
You know that I'm always full of energy.


187
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,590
How can you always be full of energy?
You're not a robot.


188
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,700
I'll stay here. Why don't you


189
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,170
get some rest?


190
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,870
No, it's okay.


191
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,540
My gosh. I shouldn't be out here chatting.


192
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,010
The tests will be done soon.


193
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,340
I should go check.


194
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,640
Wait.


195
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,210
It's okay, Song Yeo-wool.


196
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,980
Don't cry. Everything will be okay.


197
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,580
You can't cry.


198
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,760
[Patient Status Board]


199
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,100
Your name?


200
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,030
Resident registration number?


201
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,700
[Sim Ae-soon]


202
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,310
Ms. Sim Ae-soon, you can't go home
if you don't answer.


203
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,280
Goodness.


204
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,920
Yes, hello.


205
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,290
This is Detective Lee Min-jae
from Jeju Police Station.


206
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,820
You know, the townhouse employee
named Sim Ae-soon.


207
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,290
Yes, her.
What is her resident registration number?


208
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,930
She won't tell me.


209
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,470
Yes, thank you. Bye.


210
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,380
What?


211
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,340
What is this?


212
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,050
Push forward. Yes, forward.


213
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,990
Yes. A bit lower.


214
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,520
No, a little bit lower than that.


215
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,890
Just a little bit more.


216
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,730
The camera lens is on the front


217
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,960
and if you open the back,


218
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,460
-the memory card is in here.
-I see.


219
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,329
If you insert this
in a memory card reader,


220
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,339
you'll be able to play
the recorded videos.


221
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,540
-Here.
-Thank you.


222
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,440
Call us if there's any problem
with the product.


223
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,640
-Okay. Thank you.
-We'll get going then.


224
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,640
Yi-chan, look at this.


225
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,340
From now on,
if you have anything you want to say,


226
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,010
write it here and show it to me.


227
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,210
What do you think? Fun, right?


228
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,970
[You were scared too, right, Mom?
I'm fine, so don't...]


229
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,970
Are you done writing it?


230
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,540
[You were scared too, right, Mom?]


231
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,510
[I'm fine, so don't worry too much.]


232
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,690
[I love you.]


233
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,830
[I love you.]


234
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,670
I'm fine as long as you are.


235
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,240
You know I love you too, right?


236
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,680
You're so sweet.


237
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Yes, I've looked around but found nothing.


238
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,820
I think it was a false alarm.


239
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,960
Yes, thank you.


240
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,710
-Oh, my gosh. Really? It was the helper?
-That's what she said.


241
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,440
-The helper did it.
-Why do things like this keep happening?


242
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,210
Mom, Yi-chan was absent yesterday
because he was sick.


243
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,950
What? Sick where?


244
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,650
I want to visit Yi-chan
if he's absent again today.


245
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,350
I'm not too sure about that.


246
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,420
I'll ask Yi-chan how he is.


247
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,860
Yi-chan's mom might not let us see him.


248
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,890
Isn't it because you don't want to go?


249
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,130
You haven't been hanging out with
Yi-chan's mom ever since you two fought.


250
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,300
Can't you make up with her
and stay close again?


251
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,370
Adults have things
that can't be solved with an apology.


252
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,210
Why? What is that?


253
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,810
You'll know once you grow up more.


254
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,680
By the way Mom, what's adultery?


255
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,380
What? Who said that word?


256
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
The other kids.


257
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,860
You don't need to know what that is.


258
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,130
-Why?
-Because you don't.


259
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,630
Is that also an adult thing?


260
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,830
Yes, it is.


261
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,480
So your most memorable moment
on Jeju Island was the beach.


262
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,510
Did you have fun back then?


263
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,150
This must be you, Yi-chan.


264
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,960
Who's this? Your mom?


265
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,300
I don't drink canned coffee.


266
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,530
Why did you want to see me?


267
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,200
Ms. Cha Do-yeong.


268
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,540
I heard you were with Chef Jung Mi-do


269
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,040
on the night of the concert.


270
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,850
Were you with him the whole night?


271
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,180
Well...


272
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,150
I don't really remember.


273
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,220
It was hectic because of the blackout.


274
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,290
And I wasn't alone with him.
My husband was there too.


275
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,000
What's your relationship
with Chef Jung Mi-do?


276
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,840
Well... My husband invested a share
in Chef Jung's restaurant.


277
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,870
And I'm managing it with him
as the co-owner.


278
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,410
Is that everything?


279
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,640
What else could there be?


280
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,510
By the way...


281
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,550
Why are you asking me this?


282
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,050
That night,


283
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,790
Jung Mi-do turned down
the school's circuit breaker.


284
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,190
Did you find anything strange
about him that day?


285
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,320
Mi-do--


286
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,490
No, Chef Jung did? My gosh.


287
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,260
Do you know anything about


288
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,000
Chairman Doh Jin-sol
and Chef Jung Mi-do's relationship?


289
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,830
There's no way he would've done that.


290
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,140
I clearly saw them going into the hotel--


291
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,840
What I meant was,
he's not someone who would've done that.


292
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,820
I heard he was pursuing a new partnership


293
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,380
with Chairman Doh Jin-sol


294
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,950
regarding the restaurant's investment
and trademark registration.


295
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,720
Didn't you know?


296
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,460
What a total jerk.


297
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,490
Anyway, he has nothing to do with me.


298
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,930
I'm completely done with him.


299
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,730
That means you admit
you had a personal relationship with him


300
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,900
apart from a business one, right?


301
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,000
What?


302
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,470
Well... That's not what I meant.


303
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,820
I won't comment on that.


304
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,720
Mi-ran's law. Don't you know Mi-ran's law?


305
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,190
Mi-ran was investigated so unfairly


306
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,860
by people like you.


307
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,960
You thought I didn't know, right?


308
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,330
I have nothing to do on Jeju Island,
so I watch the news a lot.


309
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,170
Anyway, I won't utter a word
until my lawyer comes.


310
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
So don't try to feel me out.


311
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,620
I'm Ms. Cha Do-yeong's lawyer.
You can speak to me.


312
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,560
You never miss out on anything.


313
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,560
Ms. Song,


314
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,730
this detective tried to feel me out
by bombarding me with questions.


315
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,300

I'm sure it was nothing.

The security company came
and checked everything.

They said everything was fine.

[promise me that you won't get angry.]

the cell phone to you on Camp Day,


655
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,920
I had installed a tracking app
and a spy app on the phone.


656
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,360
I was hired to monitor you,


657
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,760
so I had no choice.


658

I'm sorry.

This is a clear violation
of the Location Information Protection Act

You know that this is a crime, right?


663
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,610
Wiretapping and surveillance
are serious felonies.

Yes, I know. Of course, I'm aware.

I heard it, but it's a wall.

A wall? What do you mean?


679

I heard it ring from inside the wall,
