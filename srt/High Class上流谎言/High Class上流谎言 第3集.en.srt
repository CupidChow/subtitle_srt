00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,990
Okay.

168
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,520
Hey, look!

169
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,560
It says "CEO".
The CEO of my agency is calling me.

170
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,630
Sure.

171
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,290
Gosh.

172
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,160
Hello. How did it go?

173
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,930
I was thinking of going to Seoul--

174
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,140
What? Who's joining?

175
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,610
Forget it. Tell the producer I'm out.

176
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,110
Why should I do it
if I'm not the main celebrity on the show?

177
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,510
[Come on, Do-yeong. Think about it.]

178
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,220
[Your last drama was a daily series
five years ago.]

179
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
[No one wants to cast you
because you're a mom now.]

180
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,420
[What will you do
if you turn this show down?]

181
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,860
[This industry isn't as easy
as you think.]

182
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
[Lower your standards.]

183
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,060
You're so mean.

184
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,270
Fine. I'll think about it.

185
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,770
I told you.
You can play again all day long.

186
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,840
You...

187
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,810
I'm confiscating your phone today.

188
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,750
Why? Give it back to me!

189
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,150
Give it back!

190
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,890
Mom, the teacher told me to sign up
for a club by next week.

191
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,990
You're right!
You have to sign up for a club!

192
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,160
I've been so out of it
that it totally slipped my mind.

193
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,100
Which club should I join?

194
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,470
Let's think. Maybe something
you could do as a hobby would be nice.

195
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
How about it?

196
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,340
Which club should you join?

197
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
What?

198
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,520
How interesting.
Is this a coincidence too?

199
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,030
The beach, the surfing shop, and today...

200
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,170
Three times can't be a coincidence.

201
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,900
What's your reason? What is it?

202
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,940
This is my son's school.

203
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,780
What do you mean?

204
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,710
Hi, Yi-chan. Good morning.

205
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,850
You know my son already?

206
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,880
Yi-chan, how do you know this man?

207
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,690
Hi, Teacher Danny.

208
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,790
Mom, he's my teacher, Danny.
He's our gym teacher.

209
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,030
Teacher?

210
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,200
Oh, my!

211
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,130
-You're the gym teacher, right?
-Yes, hello.

212
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,100
He's the new gym teacher
after Mr. Harris left.

213
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,270
You're right. Mr. Danny Oh.

214
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,510
I heard you're in charge
of Grade One's gym class

215
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,740
and the junior ice hockey club.

216
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,810
-Yes, I am.
-You're totally handsome.

217
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,780
The school must hire teachers
based on looks these days.

218
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,420
I heard you were on
the Canadian hockey team. Your build is...

219
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,050
Wow!

220
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,220
I should come to the school more often.

221
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,830
Oh, my. Are we showing
our ulterior motive too much?

222
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,500
-We'll see you again next time.
-Okay.

223
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,230
-Thank you.
-Bye.

224
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,310
Hello, ma'am.

225
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,980
I think there has been a misunderstanding.

226
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,520
Isn't it mean to conclude
it's not a coincidence

227
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,850
on the first day we met at school
just because we ran into each other

228
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,990
a couple of times before?

229
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,490
That's not it. I'm really sorry.

230
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,690
Yi-chan, I'll see you in class later.

231
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,930
-Okay.
-High five!

232
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,200
Hold on. He's a teacher?

233
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
-Yes.
-Really?

234
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,910
Yes.

235
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,840
My goodness.

236
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,690
He should've acted like a teacher
if he was one.

237
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,790
He looked unemployed
no matter how I looked at him.

Oh, my! Chef Jung!

244
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,680
It's been ages.

245

Oh, my gosh! I can't believe
we're bumping into each other here.

-How have you been?
-Great.

Here's a honeycomb tart.

249
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,099
When did you come to Jeju island?

250
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,800
Is this your new store?

251
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,530
It's not entirely my store.

252
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,940
I invested in it together
with the actress, Cha Do-yeong.

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,310
I've been busy going
back and forth from Seoul.

254
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,510
I see, with Cha Do-yeong.

255
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,010
Anyway, congratulations
on opening a new store.

Let's go over there.

259
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,200
How about a meal before you leave?
It's been a while, so it'll be on me.

260
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,500
I'd love to
but I have to go pick up my son today.

261
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,640
All right then.
Come over to the store anytime.

262
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,310
I'll always be prepared.

263
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,480

Why are you glaring at me so nastily?

267
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,350
I was wondering if this was yours.

268
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,550
I think you dropped it at the reception.

269
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,090
Well, it looks identical to mine.

270
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,990
But I've never lost mine.

271
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,430
I found this in front of the locker
my son was trapped in.

272
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,560
So what?

I doubt you came here
to find the owner of that.

Hurry up and get to the point.

276
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,080

What is this out of nowhere? Why?

279
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,790
Is there a reason
I should know your husband?

280
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,930
Never mind. I understand.

281
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,070
What's your relationship
with Chef Jung Mi-do?

282
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
You two looked quite close earlier.

283
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,440
He was the chef at a restaurant
where I was a regular.

284
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,940
We ran into each other by chance today.

285
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,910
Anyway, excuse me.

286
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,060
Oh, my. I can't believe I get to see
Chef Jung Mi-do here.

287
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,630
He's so hot recently.

288
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,970
You're right.

289
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,300
He's way more handsome
in real life than on TV.

290
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,270
Come to think of it, he was with that mom.

291
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,840
Do they know each other?

292
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,910
Isn't it obvious
he'd know a lot of people?

293
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,810
He's really popular.

294
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,680
He's still single, right?

295
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,350
Well... Probably.

296
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,120
Even if he's single,
with that face and talent,

297
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,660
he's got to have a girlfriend.

298
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,130
Chefs are like celebrities these days.

299
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,900
A handful of women must be lined up
trying to hit on Chef Jung.

300
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,500
People say men who can cook really well
are really sexy.

301
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,540
Both in the kitchen and in bed.

302
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,910
I don't like that. It's nasty.

303
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,790
You're right. She had this on that day.

304
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,730
I knew it.

305
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,430
But she told me she didn't lose hers.

306
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,140
She wouldn't have done that to Yi-chan.

307
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,070
She had no reason to.

308
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,980
Do you have any hunches?

309
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,480
Well...

310
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Never mind.

311
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,290
As you said,
she wouldn't have done that to a kid.

312
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,360
Coffee? I'm fine. I had some earlier.

313
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,630
It's not coffee.

314
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,080
Alcohol?

315
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,140
It's best when you have
a lot on your mind.

Cheers!

317

Nothing beats drinking in daylight.

318
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,600
You're really full of surprises.

319
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,870
Did you know?

320
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,170
I'm actually from Jeju Island.

321
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,500
Really?

322
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,870
I had no idea
because I heard you came from Hong Kong.

323
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,080
I moved there when I was 20.

324
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,980
There, I gave birth to Jae-in

325
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,010
and had a good life.

326
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,950
Then why did you come back

327
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,420
after all this time?

328
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,190
To live.

329
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,620
What?

330
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,930
What about you? Why did you move here?

331
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,570
To live, I guess.

332
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,600
After what happened to my husband,
I couldn't stay there anymore.

333
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,470
It wasn't just about Yi-chan.

334
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,640
This was the only place I could go.

335
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,850
What about your husband?

336
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,720
I haven't seen him in a while.

337
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,290
He was working abroad all the time

338
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,420
and came home just a couple of times
a year at most.

339
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,060
I thought it'd be best

340
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,330
for me and Jae-in to move here instead.

341
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,030
I see.

342
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,970
You must've been very lonely.

343
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,040
It's fine. I'm used to it.

344
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,940
To women who are lonely
and on their own. Cheers.

345
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,550
Cheers.

346
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,150
By the way, has Yi-chan decided
on which club to join?

347
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,760
The application period ends this week.

348
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,660
We should decide soon, but we're not sure.

349
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,230
There are way too many clubs.

350
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,260
I want him to join a club
where he can do something with other kids.

351
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,700
What about Jae-in?

352
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,400
If you haven't decided yet,
how about we let them join the same club?

353
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,800
Should we do that?

354
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,240
That'd be really great.

355
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,220
So what about Jun-hee?
Ice hockey, I assume?

356
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,050
Probably. Just like Jun-mo.

357
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,220
Right. I heard that you sponsored
the ice hockey team when it started.

358
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,420
Jun-mo is the senior team captain, right?

359
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,530
The kids are quite good.

360
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,460
And the school didn't have
any proper rink.

361
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,200
As you all probably know,

362
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,570
The American upper class
puts a great emphasis on elitist sports

363
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,170
from when the children are very young.

364
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,970
Rugby, ice hockey, horseback riding...

365
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,010
They all infuse the children with
a competitive spirit and motivation.

366
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,910
Ice hockey, in particular,
is a team sport.

367
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,910
If our kids want to enter
a boarding school later on,

368
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,280
[A private school with a dormitory]

369
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,380
it can work as an advantage.

370
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,890
To get into the Ivy League,

371
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,690
a good GPA and SAT score aren't enough.

372
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,090
[GPA: Grade point average,
SAT: A college entrance exam in the US]

373
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,130
It's important to participate in
team sports from early on.

374
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,130
Will Si-woo participate too?

375
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,330
Of course.

376
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,030
He started playing ice hockey
at seven with Jun-hee.

377
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,430
I'm not sure about that Ivy thing though.

378
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,770
You mean the Ivy League.

379
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,940
In any case, ice hockey looks cool,

380
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,150
so it's all worth it.

381
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,180
Extracurricular activities are
all about equipment, aren't they?

382
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,950
It's not too competitive either.

383
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,050
I could even send Si-woo abroad
if he wants.

384
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,520
But the moms will be very busy.

385
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,430
We have to get the equipment ready,
drive the kids to practice,

386
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,760
and even find private lessons.

387
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,370
And what about all the away games
every season?

388
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,900
Gosh, what a headache.

389
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,240
That's where the term "hockey mom"
comes from.

390
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,970
Anyway, it's important for the kids
to experience many things before eight.

391
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,810
It's our job to discover and foster

392
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,880
our kids' taste and talent.

393
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Absolutely. Doctors raise doctors,

394
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,750
and musicians raise musicians.

395
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,020
That's especially true
when it comes to art and sports.

396
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,960
Excuse me for a second.

397
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,510
It's a limited edition
from the latest cruise collection.

398
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
It's sold out in every store in the world.

399
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,620
You won't be able to get
one of these anywhere, ever.

400
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,660
She seems to try so hard

401
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,230
to keep up with you.

402
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,670
She's nice to me.

403
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,840
You could say
she's straightforward and frank,

404
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,300
but she can sometimes be
pretty embarrassing.

405
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,340
What can she do?
She comes from a different world.

406
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,380
That's what makes her
refreshing and amusing.

407
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,140
Let's be kind.

408
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,920
-You're right.
-Okay.

409
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,460
How did it go?

410
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,530
It was the first time
you met the students.

411
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,430
This is just the beginning.

412
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm not sure yet.

413
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,470
Many of the parents are quite vocal

414
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,640
and have a high profile.

415
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,510
Be sure not to cause any trouble.

416
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,580
I'm aware that this is

417
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,150
a very special school.

418
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,950
You don't have any teaching experience.

419
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,720
Please remember why you were hired

420
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,820
and what your role in this school is

421
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,630
-at all times.
-Yes.

422
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,260
I'm very well aware of that too.

423
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,970
The club activities start today.

424
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,410
You know the mothers have
high expectations, right?

425
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,340
Like I said, be sure to hold your ground

426
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,110
against the controlling hockey moms.

427
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,950
I understand.

428
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,150
If you're done, may I leave?

429
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,480
I have class.

430
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,390
Fencing, hockey, rugby, ice hockey...

431
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,360
This school has so many sports clubs.

432
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,790
There are a lot of people here.

433
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,500
It's the first day
of the application period.

434
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,030
Still, ice hockey isn't that popular,

435
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,230
-compared to the other sports.
-Really?

436
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,900
What if there are too few students
who want to sign up?

437
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,110
I don't know.

438
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,240
-Let's see.
-Okay.

439
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,350
Really?

440
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,450
We were worried for nothing.

441
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,190
Oh, hello.

442
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,290
-Hello.
-Oh, my.

443
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,760
Does your kid play ice hockey too?

444
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,630
When did he start?

445
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,830
He's a beginner.

446
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,570
A beginner?

447
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,640
There are many sports to choose from.

448
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,240
Why did you choose ice hockey?

449
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,770
I persuaded her.

450
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,980
Why...

451
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,350
Well, it's a free country.

452
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,750
Everybody has to start somewhere.

453
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,050
Good luck.

454
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,860
Wow.

455
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,600
Great turnout.

456
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,700
Hello, I'm the new coach
of the junior ice hockey club.

457
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,800
My name is Danny Oh. Nice to meet you all.

458
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,640
The class starts next week.

459
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,580
I'll have the students warm up in pairs

460
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,750
to find out their levels.

461
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,720
When you're done signing up,
feel free to have a look around the rink.

462
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,360
It's scary.

463
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:35,700
My goodness.

464
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,880
It's so cool.

465
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,180
Aren't they incredible?

466
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,120
He's really good.

467
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,630
I know.

468
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,280
I can see why he's so popular.

469
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,890
Mom, am I going to play ice hockey?

470
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,890
What do you think? Do you want to?

471
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,790
Yes, I want to.

472
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,560
He's a complete beginner.

473
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,060
But he's tried skating, right?

474
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,570
Yes, he took some lessons.

475
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,800
But I got too busy to drive him
to the rink, so he had to quit.

476
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,240
Then there's nothing to worry about.

477
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,140
Most kids their age are
pretty much on the same level,

478
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,680
except for some really talented ones.

479
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,920
Mom.

480
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,890
Can we invite Jae-in over today?

481
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,420
Jae-in?

482
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,620
Mom, can I play at Yi-chan's?

483
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,990
They should've asked us first.

484
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,530
Jae-in.

485
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,430
Maybe not today, but...

486
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,930
Jae-in, you can do that.

487
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,700
It's still a little messy,

488
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,440
but let's all go straight
to our place then.

489
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,680

No, I never thought that.

649
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,320
But I must ask you

650
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,560
not to cross the line.

651
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,360
Right, that reminds me.

652
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,200
Here. Let me return this.

653
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,970
I bought these new ones in the market
for 15,000 won.

654
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,140
It's the thought that counts,
so that's all I'll accept.

655
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,990
As a coach,
you're not here to lead just one kid.

656
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,490
It is your duty to make
the best decisions for the team

657
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,430
and understand who you are working for.

658
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,460
And you must take responsibility
for your own decisions.

659
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,040
-What are they talking about?
-What will happen now?

660
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,840
Are we going to dissolve the club?

661
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,280
I'm not sure.
Si-woo's mother is one thing,

662
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,650
but if Jun-hee's mother
is adamant about it too...

663
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,880
Gosh. Not a day goes by without trouble
thanks to someone.

664
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,690
Should I go in?

665
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,120
Not yet.

666
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,830
-Gosh!
-My goodness.

667
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,430
Si-woo's mom called me
to let us know that she's okay,

668
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,500
so don't worry.

669
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,940
I was hoping
we could go out together afterward,

670
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,710
but I don't think
anyone's in the mood to go out.

671
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,550
-All right.
-It's okay.

672
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,490
It's strange.

673
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,390
Why is it that everything gets
so messed up when you're involved?

674
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,400
Right, I feel the same way.

675
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,100
You may not get it,

676
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,670
but in winter sports like hockey,
a total beginner with no training

677
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,100
is like a ticking time bomb.

678
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,870
"Ticking time bomb"?

679
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,440
Try putting yourself in my shoes.

680
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,510
If you were me, would you want your child

681
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,540
to play with a total beginner
like your son?

682
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,110
If you're inexperienced and confused,

683
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,720
your kid will have a hard time.

684
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,120
For everyone's sake,
I hope we won't see him again on the team

685
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,750
after this.

686
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,780
Mom. Can I not play hockey anymore?

687
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,250
Of course, you can.
I won't let anyone do that to you.

688
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,350
Don't worry.

689
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,420
But still, Jun-hee and Si-woo hate me.

690
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,320
No, they don't.

691
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,190
They're super rich.

692
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,930
They're good at hockey
and can speak English well.

693
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,660
And Jun-hee's older brother
goes to this school too.

694
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,870
Yi-chan,
those things have nothing to do with this.

695
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,340
But Se-joon hated me at my old school,

696
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,540
and that's why I left the school.

697
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,910
Mom, I want to stay at this school

698
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,910
and keep playing hockey.

699
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,220
So I should just put up with it, right?

700
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,020
I won't fight anymore.

701
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,800
No. I promise you
that it will never happen again.

702
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,670
I know you were also upset earlier
because of me.

703
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,300
No, I wasn't. I was just...

704
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,510
-Are you putting it on me?
-Yes.

705
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,750
There. I'll protect you from now on.

706
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,050
So that no one
can hurt your feelings again

707
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,120
or bother you.

708
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,790
Thanks to my son, I feel so safe now.

709
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,230
-So we both have to stay strong.
-Yes, sounds good.

710
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,230
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

711
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,640
Are you two having a pep talk?

712
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,440
-My gosh, Mr. Oh.
-Mr. Oh!

713
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,740
You had to deal with that because of us.
I'm really sorry.

714
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,150
My gosh.

715
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,580
No, it's okay.
I came too unprepared for the first class.

716
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,350
I'm sorry.

717
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,390
And about the other day...

718
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,290
I made a ridiculous assumption.

719
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:55,760
I'm sorry.

720
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,300
You know, that day...

721
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,130
It's all in the past.

722
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,340
I understand why
you thought I was a stalker.

723
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,010
No, that's not it. I was really...

724
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,940
Anyway, the rumors really were true.

725
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,210
The mothers here are so overbearing.

726
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,620
You won't let Yi-chan quit
because of that, right?

727
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,050
Of course, I won't.

728
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,520
I have to think about
what we're going to do.

729
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,630
You're okay, right?

730
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,130
Of course.
I don't care if I have to quit this job.

731
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,830
I won't let them kick him out.

732
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,500
They're being ridiculous.

733
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,270
Anyway,
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

734
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,870
And that said, An Yi-chan.

735
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:42,310
How about a cheer?

736
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,880
Put your hand on top of mine.
That's it. Okay.

737
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,910
Ms. Song, you have to join us too.

738
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,350
-Right, sure.
-Great.

739
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,450
-All right, one, two, three. We can do it!
-We can do it!

740
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,390
Thank you.

741
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,390
I will not let this slide.
I absolutely can't.

742
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,060
How dare she.

743
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,300
How could she shove me down onto the ice?

744
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,170
I'm so embarrassed.

745
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,670
Given what happened today,

746
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,900
the school can't ignore it anymore.

747
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,310
We can just get rid of the team
and hire a new coach.

748
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,180
Really?

749
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,680
Just form a whole new team?

750
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,420
It's a kids' sports team. We can just
get rid of it and make a new one.

751
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,990
I have to take Jun-hee and Jun-mo
to Seoul tomorrow for their lesson,

752
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,820
so I'll look for someone there.

753
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,660
Anyway, you fell hard earlier.
Are you okay?

754
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,600
Of course. I'm an actress.

755
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,730
Although I've heard people say
I'm a terrible actress.

756
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,670
Aren't you starting
a new variety show soon?

757
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,570
You should be careful.

758
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,240
Gosh, I'm still so annoyed.

759
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,640
I need something to cheer myself up.

760
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,520
Where is everyone?

761
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,750

Ho-san, I'm in a really bad mood today.

764
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,920
You need to attend to us better.

765
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,760
You came unannounced, so we had to
deal with the other customers first.

766
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,060
My apologies.

770

a closer eye on your kid.

807
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,110
No wonder your kid is such a mess.

808
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,740
This is driving me crazy.

809
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,960
Gosh.

810
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,820
What do you think you're doing?

811
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,560
This is lined with silk.

812
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,260
And it's soaked.

813
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:41,300
Tell me the whole truth of what happened,

814
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,670
or I'll tell everyone what I saw here.

815
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,260
Oh, no.

816
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,120
Where did he go?

817
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,130
I didn't know the kid went in there.

818
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,630
It wasn't intentional.

819
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,830
It was just bad luck.

820
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,400
Why did it have to happen that way?

821
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,010
Is that why you sent me
flowers with no name

822
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,340
and texted me at my husband's number
to threaten me?

823
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,450
What text? And what flowers?

824
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,250
What on earth are you talking about?

825
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,090
Gosh.

826
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,060
[My son]

827
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,560
Hi, Si-woo.

828
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,830
What? What are you talking about?

829
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,230
The police?

830
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,140
Oh, okay.

831
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,170
I'll be right there.

832
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,440
-Oh, dear.
-Where are you going?

833
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:34,850
We're not done yet.

834
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,950
I have nothing more to say to you.

835
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,620
Whatever happened, happened.
Tell people whatever you want.

836
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,390
Gosh.

837
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,410
Si-woo, what are you doing out here
at this hour?

838
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,550
Where's your mom?

839
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,090
She went to the police station.

840
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,360
Something bad happened to my dad.

841
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,690
I see. I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Why don't you go back inside?

842
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,660
I want to wait here.

843
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,970
Ms. Song, did my dad do something bad?

844
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,510
I'm sure he didn't.

845
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,910
But your mom will be worried
if you stand out here.

846
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,010
Go to bed.
Your mom will be back in no time.

847
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,180
I promise.

848
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,090
Okay?

849
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,490
My goodness.

850
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,260
Please don't come here.

851
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,700
Sign here, please.

852
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,330
Sorry, this isn't a good time.

853
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,570
You're Mr. Kwak Sang-gun's guardian.
I need your signature here.

854
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,050
Gosh.

855
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,420
What is it now?
How did you know I was here?

856
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,260
Here's an attorney appointment letter.

857
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,060
Make a decision quickly.

858
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,800
Do you want to hire me
as your attorney or not?

859
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,400
[Attorney Appointment Letter]

860
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,330
[Attorney Song Yeo-wool]

861
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,700
Are you out of your mind? Are you unwell?

862
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,940
After humiliating me in front of the kids
and shoving me in the water,

863
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,380
you want to be my attorney
all of a sudden?

864
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,450
[Oh Soon-sang]

865
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,420
It's the school CCTV footage
from that day.

866
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,700
I don't care whether you hire me or not.

867
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,770
You've been having an affair,
and your husband's been buying sex.

868
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:12,170
You know how fast news travels
on social media these days, right?

869
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,910
Your career in show business will be over.

870
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,240
And what will the other moms think?

871
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:19,780
Are you ready to handle all of that?

872
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,980
If you hire me as your attorney,
our confidentiality agreement

873
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,450
will force me to delete this immediately
and keep it a secret.

874
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,050
So make up your mind.

875
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,360
You're mean. How can you blackmail me
over a matter like this?

876
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,900
It's not blackmail. It's a negotiation.

877
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,730
How can I trust you?

878
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,600
It's up to you
whether you trust me or not.

879
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:48,210
But the thing is,
Si-woo is waiting for you at home.

880
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,740
She's worried about you.

881
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,110
I promised him
I'd make sure you come home soon.

882
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,150
If you want me to keep that promise,

883
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,760
answer my question honestly.

884
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,060
-What's the question?
-An Ji-yong.

885
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,760
What was your relationship
with my late husband?

886
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,940
Well, what do you think?

887
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,010
What? You want to know?

888
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,410
Gosh, is that what all this was about?

889
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,880
Why do you keep asking me
about your husband?

890
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,350
You were the last person
who was with him on that yacht.

891
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,790
Like people say,

892
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,560
are you the one who killed your husband?

893
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,100
Murderer Song Yeo-wool.

894
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,950
You're one scary woman.

895

[High Class]

896
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:55,800

both your family and career?]

[Did you really not know your husband?]

899
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,670
[What a foolish woman.]

01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:03,980
[Now I understand.]

901
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,180
[The reason you couldn't stand me
was because of my husband.]

902
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,850
[-I've put up with you all this time.]
-Jun-hee! What are you doing?

903
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,820
-Wait!
[-How dare you make my kid eat garbage?]

904
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,850
[To think there was something going on
between my husband and that woman,]

905
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,290
[I couldn't stand it anymore.]

906
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:18,460
She shouldn't have been accepted here
in the first place.

907
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,160
[No matter what happens, I can't leave.]

908

[Let's see who wins.]
