00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,780
-I'll use your credit card.
-Why do you need to go to Seoul?

167
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,290
You know, there's this event
at Si-woo's school.

168
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,760
But there are no decent salons
or department stores here.

169
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,730
Gosh, my hair looks awful
because of the seaside air.

170
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,330
Why don't you just hire a private jet?

171
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,070
What should I do, then?

172
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,570
Why do you think I'm stuck here?

173
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,170
Our one and only son is going to perform
with an orchestra,

174
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,510
but you won't even be there.

175
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,510
The other kids will even have
all their aunts and uncles there,

176
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,880
let alone their dads.

177
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,220
-You said he's just playing the big drum.
-That is a musical instrument too!

178
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,290
-Unbelievable.
-I'm leaving.

179
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,390
And he calls himself a dad?

180
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,330
Gosh, look at this hair! I'm so annoyed.

181
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,630
If Jun-hee and Jae-in
are performing together,

182
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,130
they should probably wear the same thing.

183
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,870
Shouldn't Jae-in's mom come to Seoul too?

184
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,240
I don't know.

185
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,940
That reminds me. Jae-in is so weird, Mom.

186
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,540
She said Yi-chan is her little brother.

187
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,150
"Little brother"? What do you mean?

188
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,520
That's what she said.
She said she's his big sister

189
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,290
and told us not to bother him.
She caused a big scene.

190
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,620
So I asked her, "You two have
different moms. Who's your dad?"

191
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,130
She couldn't answer.

192
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,360
She's such a weirdo.

193
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
My brother has two dads.

194
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,770
Maybe they have two moms.

195
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,810
Right, Mom?

196
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,210
What?

197
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,630
I'll sue you for damaging the painting.

198
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,600
And just so you know,
I have no intention of settling,

199
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,370
so enjoy your time at the police station.

200
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,870
I never asked you to settle. Go ahead.
I don't care about that painting.

201
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,940
And I burned the one
that was hung in the study.

202
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,440
What? How dare you...

203
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,080
I own the house.

204
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,560
Just be glad that I'll stop here
because the kids are listening.

205
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,160
Do you think you're a match for me?

206
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,270
Be careful.
I won't get stabbed in the back twice.

207
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,870
Okay?

208
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,940
Let's go.

209
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,320
That looked as icy
as a Siberian snowstorm.

210
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,550
Something's definitely going on,
don't you think?

211
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,390
If those two really are connected
that way...

212
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,520
Oh, my gosh.

213
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,530
That'd be so crazy, don't you think?

214
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,560
Don't make such a fuss.
It's just what the kids are saying.

215
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,600
Exactly. That's what makes it
even more suspicious.

216
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,300
Think about it. It actually explains

217
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,640
why Jae-in's mom came over to your side.

218
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,870
And this tension too.

219
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,940
Stop it. I've heard enough gossip.

220
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,750
I can't believe it. A mistress?

221
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,980
What?

222
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,280
Well, I'm sure they had their reasons.

223
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,890
Let's keep quiet.

224
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,660
If rumors spread,
the school's reputation will be destroyed,

225
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,660
and so will ours.

226
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,890
Right, okay.

227
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,470
But with all this going on,

228
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,870
will you let her kid share the stage
with Jun-hee at the festival?

229
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,210
I'm his big sister.

230
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,050
Leave my little brother alone.

231
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,220
-Mom.
-Yes? What is it?

232
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,360
Nothing. Never mind.

233
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,030
Hwang Jae-in.
Be careful not to mess up this part today.

234
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,030
Ready, go.

235
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,920
Hwang Jae-in!

236
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,920
You keep messing up this part!

237
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,390
How are we going to play together
if you keep messing up?

238
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,960
Aren't you going to practice properly?

239
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,460
Okay, I'll do better.

240
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,500
This is so annoying.

241
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,700
Kwak Si-woo! It's so loud.
Stop it, will you?

242
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,240
What do you care? I'll do what I want.

243
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,580
Seriously,
I can't play with kids below my level.

244
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,780
She's really something.

245
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,050
Hey, is it true that you and An Yi-chan

246
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
are siblings?

247
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,390
Then how come
your last names are different?

248
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,930
Did your dad get divorced and remarried?

249
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,370
That's what my brother's dad did.

250
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,040
No. My mom and dad are not divorced.

251
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,310
Neither are my parents.

252
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,540
Really? Then what happened?

253
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,250
My mom and dad talk about divorce
all the time.

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,850
Does it mean I'll have two dads too?

255
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,250
I don't know.

256
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Why are adults so complicated?

257
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,660
Getting married once is enough, isn't it?

258
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,890
Totally.

259
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,690
I don't understand adults.

260
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,630
Gosh.

261
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,230
You're going to wreck your knees
by bending over like that at our age.

262
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,030
Use your tools.

263
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Here. Drink this.

264
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,240
What is it?

265
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,770
Just say thank you and drink it.

266
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,610
It's supposed to be good for your knees.

267
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,670
Wel--

268
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,610
Welcome.

269
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,040
Hello.

270
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,220
You asked
if I had been here before, right?

271
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,580
Yes, I did.

272
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,090
Is the person you saw back then...

273
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,090
this woman, perhaps?

274
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, it is.
They even came to the restaurant.

275
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,930
- Was it this woman?
- Sir.

276
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,030
What is it?

277
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,770
Building F's electricity went out
and asked for someone to come quickly.

278
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,970
I forgot to tell you.

279
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,770
Why would you only mention it now?

280
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,640
-I'm sorry. We should get going.
-Please excuse us.

281
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,910
-Where was it again? Let's hurry.
-Building F.

282
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,550
Seriously.

283
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,990
I feel much better now.

284
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,590
This atmosphere.

285
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,030
See? You can feel
the Cheongdam vibe even from the air.

286
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,070
You sound as if you were in a remote area
in Africa for the past few years.

287
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,900
Oh, my gosh.

288
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,640
Don't tell anyone I did your hair
if you're going to leave it like this.

289
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,380
-Get ready to do a haircut.
-Okay.

290
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,110
It's so upsetting.

291
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,150
I have to get all of this trimmed.

292
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,020
Do-yeong?

293
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,630
Do-yeong! It's been a while!

294
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,730
Yes, it's been a while.

295
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,360
What have you been up to lately?
I haven't heard from you in a while.

296
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,870
I'm quite busy, traveling back and forth
from Jeju Island.

297
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,970
Jeju Island? Why Jeju Island?

298
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,040
Oh, because of your restaurant?

299
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,540
Is that why you look so haggard--

300
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,010
I mean, you look healthier.

301
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,090
That reminds me, what was that
variety show by producer Kim Sun-ho again?

302
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,060
"Mom's On the Way!"
I heard you got turned down for that.

303
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,060
I just heard your name wasn't on it.

304
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,630
So I thought you totally quit work.

305
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,300
Anyway, you shouldn't trust those jerks
at the broadcasting station. You know?

306
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,510
What happened to that show?
Why was it called off?

307
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,810
Anyway, I get it, so get me on a show.

308
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,820
I don't care if it's home shopping
or a couples' variety. I'll do anything.

309
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,490
Han So-hee, that sly fox.
She's rubbing salt in my wounds.

310
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,560
Gosh, how annoying.

311
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,420
I'm hanging up.

312
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,870
Ji-seon, let me get a facial
and laser treatment tomorrow.

313
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,100
I heard the "Nam Ji-seon laser"
is totally famous these days.

314
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,080
Should I get some more botox
while I'm at it?

315
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,980
It's only been a month.

316
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,650
Your skin will become sensitive
if you get it too often.

317
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,180
I'm so frustrated.

318
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,150
Being stuck on an island
is annoying enough as it is.

319
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,290
But look at the state of my hair and skin!

320
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,130
Oh, my! Hi, babies!

321
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,700
I'll make myself feel better
with you guys.

322
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,170
These are pieces I selected
from the new pre-fall collection.

323
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,840

That reminds me, I got rid of
the birthday present you sent to Jun-mo.

congratulate my son's--

Was it really for him?

342

play the part of a father

only after we got divorced
because of your affair.

344

It must've been
someone else's idea, not yours.

I was going to use this card.

Wow. You're looking good.

Your hair came out great.

387
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,320
How can there be no department store
on the island?

Right?

when in fact, it's a life of exile.

391
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,630
Is Jae-in practicing well
for the festival?

392
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,700
I think she's getting nervous.

393
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,540
She's never been in a festival this big.

394
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,440
There's no need to be.
It's just a kids' concert.

Anyway,

396
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,050
Noah said something interesting.

397
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,180
What is it?

398
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,820
I heard An Yi-chan, the lawyer's kid,

399
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,120
is Jae-in's younger brother.

400
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,500
Is that true?

401
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,130
Oh, my gosh.

402
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,570
The kids were just joking around.

403
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,940
I don't know how it all started,

404
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,080
but there's no fire without smoke, right?

405
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,450
So what do you think, Na-yoon?

406
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,460
Did the kids really say that?

407
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,760
My goodness.

408
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,170
Since Jae-in is an only child,

409
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,200
she makes up things like that
all the time.

410
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,970
"So-and-so is my little brother.
I'm so-and-so's big sister."

411
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,670
She loves that.

412
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,340
That's funny.

413
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,280
But the thing is,

414
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,250
what the kids say sounds too convincing

415
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,650
to have been made up.

416
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,160
If that really were true,

417
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,390
how could Yi-chan's mom be
so cool about it?

418
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,460
Or how could I be so shameless?

419
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,430
That's exactly what I mean.

420
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,830
See? I told you.

421
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,570
I did hear that this is a very small place

422
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,740
and that the moms would spread
all kinds of rumors.

423
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,340
But this doesn't feel nice.

424
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,010
Jae-in's dad is working abroad.
That's why he can't live with us.

425

The things people say...

426
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
It's just unbelievable.

427
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,190
Is it because there's nothing better
to do around here?

428
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,300
I feel bad for all the moms.

429
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,900
Don't you agree?

430
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,170
I have to go now. Excuse me.

431
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,610
That was awkward.

432
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,380
I can't believe she just left
after saying what she wanted to say.

433
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,550
It looks like the joke's on you.

434
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,250
As if.

435
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,890
This is all because you picked her kid

436
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,130
as your kid's partner in the festival.

437
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,500
-How so?
-Before choosing her,

438
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,760
shouldn't you have thought about us first?

439
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,900
This is disappointing.

440
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,570
I feel hurt.

441
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,170
You could've picked Noah.

442
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,670
Exactly. I agree.

443
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,780
You could've picked Yu-bin too.

444
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,750
I didn't know you had so many complaints.

445
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,750
But it's not my decision.

446
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,820
It's the school's.

447
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,050
Think carefully.

448
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,790
I know you dislike Yi-chan's mom,

449
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,090
but that woman is even worse.

450
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,860
I get it. Let's just drop it and drink.

451
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
Where are you going?

452
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,270
I have somewhere to be.

453
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,440

454
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,640

455
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,460
Are you leaving already?
Where are you going?

456
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm meeting someone.

457
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,070
You're meeting someone?

458
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,640
Who? Why?

459
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,240
Stay a little longer.

460
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,370
I'm already late.

461
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,010
I'll see you tomorrow.

462
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,510
It must be someone important.

463
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,220
You're missing dinner and leaving
your business partner behind.

464
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,050
Are you slacking off
because the restaurant isn't yours?

465
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,620
Where's your sense of responsibility?

466
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,090
I've never thought
the restaurant wasn't mine.

467
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,300
Come on, I was just joking.

468
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,500
But it's true that you received
an investment from me.

469
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,670
Anyway, I'm off.

470

See you at the concert.

471
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,480
Who are you meeting?
Why can't you tell me?

472
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,950
What is it? Flowers and dinner plans
that I don't know about...

473
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,890
Are you cheating on me?

474
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,290
What makes you think

475
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,860
you can pry into who I meet and what I do?

476
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,700
What? "Pry"?

477
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,140
Then what am I to you?

478
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,570
That has nothing to do with this.

479

about things like this,

I'm really late. Bye.

483

Why are you even seeing me?

484

What was going on with him?

648
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,030
How are Nam Ji-seon, the investment,

649
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,230
my husband, this school, the foundation,

650
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,000
and you all involved?

651
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,570
I would like to know that too.

652
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,170
Let's talk again after tomorrow's event.

653
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,910
I think we'll have a lot to talk about.

654
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,750
[Letter of Resignation]

655
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,950
This is the additional information
you requested.

656
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,620
With this, I'm going to end our business.

657
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,130
Whether I go to prison
and waste my life away,

658
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,400
this is as far as we go.

659
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,430
I will leave the school
as soon as tonight's concert is over.

660
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,240
[Letter of Resignation]

661
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,180
You're unbelievably reckless.

662
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,050
What's your reason for going this far?

663
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,490
Ten years ago, I ruptured my ligament

664
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,260
and while I moved
from the ice rink to this low life,

665
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,360
I realized one thing.

666
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:33,030
Never do anything that I can't handle.

667
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,070
If I go any further than this,
I won't be able to handle it.

668
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,880
And in our industry,

669
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,480
a background check
on the client is necessary.

670
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,280
I've left everything in that flash drive.

671
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,550
You had a lot going on.

672
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,920
If you want to send me to prison,

673
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,320
you'll have to risk your own life as well.

674
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,960
I hope you live a long and healthy life.

675
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,540
What's wrong, Jae-in?

676
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,080
Is it because of the concert?

677
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,810
No.

678
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,950
Don't worry too much. You're really good.

679
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,650
No, I'm not.

680
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,060
Jae-in will be on stage
as planned with Jun-hee.

681
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,100
What? Then...

682
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,800
What do you think you're doing?

683
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,900
I told you there's no reason
for Jae-in to be excluded.

684
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,900
Everything has already been decided.

685
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,670
Stop being so stubborn.

686
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,780
Don't ruin the whole festival
because of your greed.

687
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,710
You're the one who's being greedy, not me.

688
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,750
Do you even know
what kind of festival this is?

689
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,880
Teacher!

690
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,250
-Someone is in trouble!
-What's going on?

691
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,590
It's Jae-in!

692
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,890
-What about Jae-in?
-Come with me!

693
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,630
Yes, Mom. It's me.

694
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,740
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my gosh.

695
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,970
What is she going to do?

696
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,110
Jae-in, your violin.

697
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,210
Oh, my gosh.

698
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,310
Your violin is in pieces.

699
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,710
Is it really smashed?

700
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,620
What's wrong?

701
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,020
-What's wrong, Jae-in?
-Are you okay?

702
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,220
Are you all right?

703
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
-What--
-Jae-in!

704
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,060
Teacher! Jae-in must be sick!

705
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,830
-Teacher!
-Teacher!

706
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,940
I think she was under a lot of stress
because of the festival.

707
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,700
You don't have to worry.

708
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,910
You should get some rest as well.

709
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,470
Thank you.

710

[The chairman forgot
she had an important appointment today.]

711
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,460
[She asked me to let you know
that she can't make it.]

712
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,460
How could you call right before we begin?

713
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,730
What is the important appointment?

714
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,000
You'd better tell me the truth, Ms. Choi.

715
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,670
Chairman Jung's wine party?

716
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,080
Tell the chairman

717
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,780
that her granddaughter did an amazing job
at the concert.

718
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,980
And tell her to have a great time
at the party.

719
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,650
Did you want to exclude Jae-in that badly?

720
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,460
You're really something.

721
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,290
You broke a child's instrument.

722
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,800
Why would I do that to you?

723
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,770
You still don't seem to get it.

724
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,300
Can't you see who hates you that much?

725
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,340
The two of you are very similar.
It's entertaining to watch you two.

726
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,450
[Ladies and gentlemen,
please get back to your seats.]

is about to begin.]

728

00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
My gosh, you look so dashing.

730
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,660
I'll be watching, so do your best.

731
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,760
Of course.

732
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,000
-You know, Mom...
-Yes?

733
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,140
Jae-in can't play today.

734
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,340
Really? Why, all of a sudden?

735
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,810
Her violin broke.

736
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,010
Then she suddenly got a stomachache,
so she went to the infirmary.

737
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,580
My gosh. How did that happen?

738
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,350
So anyway,
Jun-hee will be performing alone.

739
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,720
Jae-in practiced so hard.

00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,620
I said I'd come. Here.

752
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,530
Don't be like that.
I came to congratulate you.

You said you couldn't make it.

Come on.
How could I miss my only son's concert?

758

-I need to get some investments.
-I see.

-By the way...
-Right.

Say hello. This is Chef Jung.

761

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,320
Thank you for everything.

What are you talking about?

766

It's a win-win
for both Do-yeong and myself.

767

Anyway, enjoy the festival. I'll be off.

But the concert...

788

It's okay.

I'm fine as long as
you don't get sick or hurt.

Why did you play this trick on me?

810
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,730
Yes.

811
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,470
I'm Oh Soon-sang.

812
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,070
A client asked me to keep an eye on you.

813
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,740
That's why I came here.

814
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:01,770
A client?

815
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:09,580
I wasn't your only client?

816
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,580
Why me though?

817
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,650
How much of what you said is true?

818
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,360
Danny Oh, a gym teacher...
What about Canada and ice hockey?

819
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,330
Was it all a lie?

820
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,630
Answer this first.

821
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:32,040
Who put you up to this?

822
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,670
For what purpose?

823
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,770
I can't tell you that

824
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,150
at this moment.

825
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,350
Fine.

826
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,350
I'm going to the police.

827
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,120
I'll sue you and the entire school

828
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,790
for obstruction of business
as well as fraud.

829
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,890
Let's see how long
you can keep your mouth shut.

830
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:01,000
Hold on. Calm down and hear me out.

831
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,540
What? What do you want to tell me?

832
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,070
Are you afraid,
now that I bring up the police?

833
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:24,360
What happened?

834
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,790
My gosh.

835
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,380
Chairman Doh.

836
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,890
Chairman Doh, are you here?

837
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,620
Chairman Doh, are you okay?

838
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,660
What do I do? I need to call an ambulance.

839
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,830
An ambulance...

840
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,120
Oh, no. My goodness.

841
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,900
Who is it?

842
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,950
[High Class]

843
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,320
[She was found unconscious in her office.]

844
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,580
[She was already dead when she got here.]

845
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,390
[The police will be here really soon.]

846
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,720
[The flash drive. I must find it.]

847
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,860
[You must want to cover it up quietly,]

848
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,090
[but that's not going to happen.]

849
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,030
[Chairman Doh Jin-sol,
Meet me in my office now.]

850
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,890
[We'll find out sooner or later.]

851
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,230
[There's always another side
to every case.]

852
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,330
[So? Are you saying I killed her?]

853
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,800
[Jeju Police]

854
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,900
[She wasn't unconscious
when you arrived at her office.]

855
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,100
You must be out of your mind.
That's absurd.

856
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,310
[Yi-chan can stay with me.]

857
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:04,710
[Just you wait.
I'll make you pay for this.]
