the foundation and the PTA
can have them expelled

by school regulations.

if over 50 percent of the members say yes.

the other moms to sign a petition.

What brings you to call me?

329
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm not sure
if I have anything to say in person.

330
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
Fine. I'll meet you there.

331
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,330
Why did you want to see me?

332
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,500
I have something to tell you.

333
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,830
And I thought a place
without many eyes would be best.

334
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,770
I heard you're going to call for
a PTA meeting.

335
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,910
Rumors sure travel fast.

336
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,450
You're right.

337
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,980
The PTA will propose an emergency agenda.

338
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,920
By emergency agenda, what do you mean?

339
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,720
I'm sure you already know what it is.

340
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,020
Are you really going to kick out Yi-chan?

341
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,590
The incident at the bazaar.

342
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,900
All direct responsibilities lie
with Yi-chan's mom,

343
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,670
but I think you're partly at fault too.

344
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,240
Did you really pass on
what we discussed to her?

345
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,810
Yi-chan's mom told me
she heard nothing from you.

346
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,150
How are the bazaar preparations going?

347
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,280
I heard you're working
together with Yi-chan.

348
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,550
Not too bad.

349
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,090
She's full of ambition,
but she's never done something like this.

350
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,290
It'd be troublesome if something happens.

351
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,530
I'll help her out a lot
so you don't have to worry.

352
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,600
I'm relieved I have you.

353
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,200
Also, if you decide on the item,

354
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,270
let's talk about it together first.

355
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,570
The same goes with Jun-hee,
but there are kids

356
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,210
who are especially sensitive to food.

357
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,540
Don't worry.
I'll pass it on to Yi-chan's mom.

358
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,720
Honestly, I told her.

359
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,490
But things turned out for the worse

360
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,360
because she said it's nothing
to worry about and passed it off lightly.

361
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,190
What do you mean
she passed it off lightly?

362
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,800
She told me that kids' food
is all pretty much the same

363
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,960
and it's nothing to make a fuss about,

364
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,630
so I couldn't say anything more.

365
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,440
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

366
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,540
I don't think it's a problem
I can overlook with an apology.

367
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,250
To be honest, I felt bad for Yi-chan's mom

368
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,780
because she was treated like an outcast.

369
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,080
But she's so stubborn

370
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,990
and always confronts people.

371
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,420
I couldn't suddenly keep a distance
because our kids are friends.

372
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,200
All right.

373
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,100
Anyway, it's unfair to blame this incident

374
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,440
solely on one inexperienced person.

375
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,770
-Then...

377
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,580
I'll take responsibility
for what I've done.

378
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,350
It's my fault for
not keeping a distance from her.

379
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,950
That sounds as if

380
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,590
you're going to change your mind now.

381
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,160
You even called me over to talk.

382
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,160

The driver was your son, Jun-mo.

The victim will take four weeks
to recover.

because the report was canceled.

809
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,590
What did you expect?

810
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,760
Did you think I was fooling around
with your husband or something?

811
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,970
I'm disappointed.
Is that all you can think of?

812
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,570
At first, I assumed you two had teamed up.

813
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,610
You were married after all.

814
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,610
So I couldn't let you

815
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,080
show up and make a mess
at my kids' school.

816
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,910
Is that...

817
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,050
Is that why you've been harassing
me and my kid?

818
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,520
The text, the flowers, and everything?

819
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,920
You must be mistaken.

820
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,260
Why would I get up to something
so childish?

821
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:03,490
The flowers were sent
from the flower shop at your hotel.

822
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,800
In that case, it must have been
the general affairs department.

823
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,870
I can show you proof.

824
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,500
Is that really all?

825
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,240
You must want to pin
your husband's death on me.

826
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,110
But I wouldn't sacrifice a person's life
for that kind of money.

827
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,680
Does that answer your question?

828
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,850
It's not over yet. Not for your son.

829
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,290
Like I said, tell me what you want.

830
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,500
What do you say?
How about you meet me halfway?

831
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,100
Even if this concerns Jun-mo,

832
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,070
my patience has a limit.

833
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,510
I trust you'll be reasonable.

834
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,480

Hey.

Hey, I'm impressed.

846
