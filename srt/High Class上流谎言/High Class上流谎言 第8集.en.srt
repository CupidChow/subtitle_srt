00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,330
None.

167
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,300
Last night, Ms. Song

168
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,740
found Ms. Doh unconscious on the floor.

169
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,040
She was rushed to the hospital

170
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,740
but was already dead
when they arrived at the hospital.

171
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,010
So the police will come
and carry out an investigation.

172
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,180
It's just a formality,

173
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,520
so you have nothing to worry about.

174
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,930
How did that happen to Ms. Doh?

175
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,830
It was acute cardiac arrest.

176
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,630
She had some health issues,

177
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,100
and I suppose
she suddenly had a heart attack.

178
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,570
The board will appoint
a new chairman soon.

179
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,070
And for the time being, Mr. Cormer and I

180
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,080
will be filling in.

181
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,050
So I'm looking forward
to working with you, Mr. Cormer.

182
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,490
It'd be my honor.

183
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,660
This unexpected news might cause unrest

184
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,230
among the parents and the students.

185
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,060
I ask all our teachers to please make sure

186
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,900
your class schedule is not interrupted.

187
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,970
All right. That's all for now.

188
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,310
Why did she have to die in her office,
of all places?

189
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,110
Things will be stressful for a while.

190
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,780
But it has nothing to do with us.

191
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,010
You know?

192
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,820
Yes, right.

193
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,020
You probably don't know this yet
because you're still new here,

194
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,620
but this place can be pretty nasty.

195
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,690
-Why do you say that?
-These people speak English on this island

196
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,960
at the tip of this tiny country
and think they're royals.

197
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,100
It's pure comedy.

198
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,460
It's so funny, isn't it?

199
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,170
After all,
they're just frogs in a small pond.

200
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,770
Some of the teachers here
openly look down on Koreans

201
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,010
and don't even care about the kids.

202
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,110
No one knows if they're real teachers

203
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,320
or what they did before ending up here.
It's messed up.

204
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,920
I have to say,
I don't think I'm much different.

205
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,590
Then why did you come here
all the way from Canada?

206
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,460
Well, I heard about the job opening.

207
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,830
I thought it'd be a good opportunity
to make some money and travel.

208
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,870
That's why I came here.

209
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,000
I didn't plan to stay long though.

210
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,770
Teachers here quit all the time.

211
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,870
How long were you going to stay?

212
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,710
-Today is my last day.
-What?

213
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,050
Are you kidding me?

214
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,020
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,550
I guess you work out.

216
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,360
When shall we go out for dinner?

217
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,190
Right, dinner. Sometime soon.

218
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,030
Come on.

219
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,730
The police will be here really soon.

220
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,840
And I want you to deal with them

221
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,340
as our legal representative.

222
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,140
So you mean I am the legal representative?

223
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,310
Right.

224
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,580
It's our first time
dealing with a police investigation.

225
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,080
And they might want to talk to everyone

226
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,450
even if it's just a formality.

227
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,920
And the principal
is also very embarrassed as well.

228
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,390
Yes, he should be.

229
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,400
Oh, and please be discreet.

230
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,270
You know how sensitive the parents are.

231
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,640
For sure.

-Yes, sir.

Get the glass.

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,070
Pack the glass.

Sure.

Hey, gloves.

239
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,320
We need some gloves.

240
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,960
What is this?

241
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,090
-A bracelet?
-A bracelet.

242
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,210
Excuse me, can you bag this?

243
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,220
-Hold on a moment.
-Okay.

Hello.

00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,900
What is it?

248
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,040
What brings you here?

249
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,610
I'm Song Yeo-wool, the school lawyer.

250

School lawyer?

251
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,250
That's very impressive of you, Ms. Song.

252
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,520
Ms. Song Yeo-wool...

253
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,190
You're the one who found the body, right?

254
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,820
Yes, you're right.

Then...

256
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,230
do you mind going to the police station
with me for a witness interview?

257

We'll ask for the others
to do the same in order.

Let's go to my office.

Why did you go
to the chairman's office at that time?

260
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,130
Especially in the middle of the festival.

261
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,640
She texted me to come to her office.

but we haven't found her phone yet.

266
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,750
Why did she want to see you?

267
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,690
I don't know.

268
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,030
Have you known each other for a long time?
Are you two close?

269
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,790
I met her for the first time here.

270
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,500
I was a parent
before I became the lawyer of this school.

271
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,300
According to the foreigner
who came along in the ambulance,

272
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,440
she had a heart condition.

273

No, I didn't.

After your husband's death,

00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,690
you must be enjoying your second prime,
living here in Jeju.

Sending your son
to this expensive international school,

278
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,220
living at a luxurious townhouse,

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,960
and even working as the school lawyer.

What do you want to say?

281
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,130
Something bugs me.

282
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,770
Why are you here?

283
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,270
Why were you the first one

284
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,570
to find the dead chairman?

285
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,810
I simply went to her office
because of the text

286
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,680
and the chairman was already unconscious
when I arrived.

287
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,480
The hospital also said the cause of death
was acute cardiac arrest.

288
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,050
Above all, I have no motive
to kill the chairman.

I guess we'll find out over time.

There's always an invisible side
to such cases.

No, there wasn't.

if I cooperate with the investigation?

295

Are you trying to make a deal
over the investigation?

296

It'll be a win-win for both of us.

I can't tell you right now

but I also have things to find out.

300

-All right, I will.
-Yes, games are a must.

My mom goes every day.

329
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,080
No, every week.

330
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,740
The flash drive.

331
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,110
I need to find it.

332
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,210
I knew you'd be here.

333
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,270
The police will be here soon

334
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,440
though I'm not sure
if they'll ask for you.

335
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,710
If it's not through me,
don't make any comments.

336
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,410
Especially since

337
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,220
you should keep your distance
from the police right now.

338
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,420
It was Chairman Doh Jin-sol.

339
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,830
The one who asked to investigate you.

340
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,660
She wanted me to find out

341
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,100
if you knew anything
related to your husband.

342
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,440
So what did you find out?

343
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,970
That you knew nothing.

344
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,640
And your relationship with Hwang Na-yoon.

345
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,480
The chairman kept
your relationship hidden.

346
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,490
I didn't know
but either way, it's still my fault.

347
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,920
Why are you telling me this?

348
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,060
My client died

349
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,230
and our contract ended,

350
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,900
so there's no reason for me to stay here.

351
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,500
So you can come clean now?

352
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,240
Are you pinning all the blame on the dead?

353
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,540
No matter what I say,
it will all seem like an excuse,

354
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,740
but I knew I had to tell you.

355
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,750
I didn't know this would happen, though.

356
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,020
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,990
Don't be.

358
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,920
You did what you were hired to do,

359
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,320
and putting me aside,
you just did your job.

360
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,830
Hurry up and leave.

361
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,800
I hope we don't see each other again.

362
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,310
I'm here to give this back to you.

363
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,440
It was useful. Thank you.

364
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,580
Well, it's just something
I picked up off the ground.

365
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
Hi, Yi-chan. Good morning.

366
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,610
Hi, Mr. Danny.

367
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,580
Mom, he's my teacher, Danny.
He's our gym teacher.

368
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,590
And that said, An Yi-chan.
How about a cheer?

369
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,530
Put your hand on top of mine. Okay.

370
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,630
-Ms. Song, you have to join us too.
-Right, sure.

371
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,900
All right, one, two, three.

372
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,100
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

373
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,540
At least put this on your face.

374
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,570
If you don't get the swelling down now,
you'll get a bruise.

375
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
It's okay.

376
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,640
Injuries are my specialty,
so just listen to me.

377
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,980
Wait. It's okay. I'll do it.

378
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,280
You shouldn't have trusted a person
so easily.

379
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,180
[You call yourself a lawyer?]

380
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,420
You're right.

381
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,060
Song Yeo-wool, you're so pathetic.

382
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,030
Oh, my.

383
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,000
I can't believe someone died at the school
and the police showed up.

384
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,940
What in the world is going on?

385
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,080
I know, right? It's making me feel uneasy.

386
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,450
That's the usual procedure
when a death is reported.

387
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,820
But she treated us to a big meal

388
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,790
after she got a single score
for the first time

389
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,220
when we went out
to the field together last week.

390
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,620
So how can this happen overnight?

391
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,630
That reminds me, have you heard?

392
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,700
The one who found the dead chairman
was that woman.

393
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,030
The lawyer mom.

394
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,670
-Oh, my gosh! Really?
-Yes.

395
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,340
But how?

396
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,870
Right?

397
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,670
Speaking of which,

398
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,840
-could it be--
-That's enough.

399
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,240
Didn't you hear that
the chairman had a heart condition?

400
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,520
It's inappropriate to gossip
about a deceased person.

401
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,150
Before the funeral,

402
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,990
the school will most likely
make a statement.

403
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,290
And I'm sure there will be
a PTA meeting as well.

404
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,930
Why are you so quiet today?

405
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,770
What? It's just...

406
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,840
-Oh, my.
-Are you okay?

407
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,310
Are you sure everything is all right?

408
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,770
You look so pale.

409
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,810
Well, I didn't sleep well last night,

410
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,480
so I'm not feeling great today.

411
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,480
Sorry. Excuse me.

412
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,750
Be careful.

413
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,370
What are you doing here?

414
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,140
You should've been more careful.

415
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,270
Let me see.

416
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,940
I'm fine. Don't worry.

417
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,740
It's just a graze.

418
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,750
-Are you sure?
-Please. Don't do this.

419
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,280
I'm not in the mood.

420
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,720
What's wrong?

421
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,820
I'm meeting someone.

422
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,120
What is it? Flowers and dinner plans
that I don't know about...

423
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,090
Are you cheating on me?

424
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,870
I haven't seen you in so long.

425
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,840
I'm looking forward to today.

426
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,430
There you go.

427
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,460
The school chairman

428
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,430
passed away during a school event.

429
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,100
Oh, my. Were you close?

430
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,010
Not really.

431
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,510
She had a heart attack.

432
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,950
The funeral will be held at the church.

433
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,950
Did you know her?

434
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,820
I don't think so.

435
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,020
By the way, do you have time later today?

436
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,790
Some really nice champagne
and fresh ham are being delivered.

437
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,360
Well, no, I can't.

438
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,470
Find another person.

439
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,270
You're always busy meeting other people.

440
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm not meeting anyone today.

441
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,240
You don't have to try so hard.

442
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,210
I'm not interested in who you meet.

443
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,150
Are you sure?

444
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,220
The other moms are outside. I have to go.

445
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,620
Stay with me a little longer.

446
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,320
Don't do this.

447
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,360
Come on. Are you coming later?

448
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,660
I'll think about it.

449
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,630
By the way, my husband was complaining
that the sales were too low

450
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,400
compared to the costs in the last quarter.

451
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,400
I'm not good with numbers.

452
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,910
So I'll leave it to you.

453
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,040
You said this restaurant is yours.

454
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,390
Please go ahead.

455
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,460
What did you want to tell me
about the chairman?

456
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,200
There are rumors going around

457
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
about the late chairman.

458
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,970
-Like what?
-"Was it really a heart attack?"

459
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,870
"Was it really a sudden death?"

460
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,340
What's even more intriguing for people
is the fact that

461
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,250
you were the first to find her.

462
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,250
You do realize it's absurd, don't you?

463
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,620
I'm not interested in
what you did that day.

464
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,490
The problem is the rumors
rather than the truth.

465
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,090
As the school's legal advisor,
isn't it irresponsible of you

466
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,530
to let these horrible rumors spread?

467
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,700
The rumors involve you, at that.

468
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,500
This has happened twice already.

469
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,470
What do you want me to do?

470
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,640
I don't want any more disputes
over this matter

471
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,510
once the funeral is over.

472
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,550
It's especially important
that no one outside the school finds out.

473
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,520
Of course.

474
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,820
I'll see to that
as the school's legal advisor.

475
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,630
I'm glad that you understand.

476
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,730
Also, to defend the school effectively,

477
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,470
if there's anything else I need to know,
please tell me right now.

478
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,570
If any problems come up later on,

479
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,270
things will be more complicated.

480
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,410
I don't think there is.

[Chairman Doh Jin-sol, Yi-chan's mom]

491
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,670
This is Hwang Na-yoon.

492
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,080
I have something to tell you.

493
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,020
[We understand
that our parents are frustrated]

494
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,179
[and concerned by the sudden news.]

495
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,250
[We are trying our best to continue]

496
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,860
[the smooth running of our school
in the absence of the chairman.]

497
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,330
We're well aware that the recent event

498
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,430
has left all parents anxious.

499
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,230
The incident may seem
sudden and unexpected,

500
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,530
but actually, the chairman

501
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,670
had been receiving treatment
for her heart condition

502
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,370
for a long time.

503
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,840
The cause of her death is believed to be
acute cardiac arrest.

504
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,210
So I ask all of you

505
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,550
to remain calm,

506
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,650
trust the school,
and follow the school's instructions.

507
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,760
We'll make sure

508
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,760
the school runs normally
until the new chairman is elected.

509
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,930
Well now... Ms. Song, please.

510
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm Lawyer Song Yeo-wool,
the school's legal advisor.

511
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,040
It seems like there are

512
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,410
many baseless, ugly rumors going around
regarding the recent incident.

513
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,310
I ask all parents

514
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,050
to remain calm
and follow the school's directions.

515
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,690
We lost someone
who was devoted to the school.

516
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,860
Please cooperate

517
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,930
so that the school isn't damaged
by the ugly rumors.

518
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,300
Be advised that the school is ready
to take legal action if necessary.

519
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,740
Unbelievable.

520
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,430
Some police officers came by.

521
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,930
I told them I was alone
in the chairman's office that day.

522
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,270
If you're ever questioned by the police,
tell them you don't know anything.

523
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,370
Why should I?

524
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,450
People are already gossiping
about the relationship between you and me.

525
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,750
There's no need to make matters worse
with this.

526
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,520
So stay out of it.

527
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,560
Is this what the legal advisor does?

528
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,790
Scheming and covering things up?

529
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,030
It's not like that.

530
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,760
Don't lie to me.

531
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,930
Why did the chairman call you that day?

532
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,400
Are you sure the chairman collapsed
before you got there?

533
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,140
What are you trying to say?

534
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,440
Both my husband

535
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,480
and the chairman are dead now.

536
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,210
And you were the last person
they were with before they died.

537
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,880
Are you sure it's not your doing?

538
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,090
-You took them away from me--
-Think whatever you want.

539
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,690
I don't have time for your imagination.

540
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,570
I'm here to say goodbye.

541
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,440
It's her funeral today.

542
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,270
Why don't you come inside?

543
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,180
That man up there

544
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,250
doesn't really like me.

545
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,050
Because I've done a lot of bad things.

546
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,420
Are you leaving now?

547
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,990
-Yes.
-Where are you going?

548
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,030
I'm not sure.
Guys like me go where the work is.

549
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,430
But for now,
I'm going to go back to where I was.

550
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,860
And where is that?

551
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,100
Number 24, 3rd Street, Mullae-dong.

552
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,300
Private detective agency,
Master of Hunting.

553
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,080
Be careful and take care.

554
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,520
As you said, I'm a fake.

555
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,860
But not everything I did was fake.

556
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,870
To you and Yi-chan.

557
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,340
I know you don't want to see me again,

558
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,510
but if you need to find someone
or need any help,

559
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,510
give me a call.

560
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,850
Goodbye.

561
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:38,130
We will now be saying farewell
to Doh Jin-sol Theresa.

562
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,460
[Doh Jin-sol Theresa]

563
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,070
However, we take comfort in the hope

564
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,270
that we will one day
meet again in the Lord and share joy.

565
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,980
Therefore, our last goodbye represents

566
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,880
each other's love,

567
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,310
relief of pain, and encouragement of hope.

568
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,350
Let us now pray together for the deceased.

569
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,550
Almighty Father,

570
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,260
we entrust Doh Jin-sol Theresa to you now.

571
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,930
So forgive her for all her sins
as a weak human being.

572
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,500
Let her rest in endless joy
with the saints in your kingdom.

573
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,010
[It was only a short time, but thank you.]

574
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,320
[For making me feel]

575
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,420
[like I'm a good guy
for the first time in my life.]

576
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,590
Chairman Doh Jin-sol was always kind to me

577
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,860
like an older sister and a friend.

578
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,000
Her absence

579
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,630
feels emptier

580
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,340
and bigger than ever.

581
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,210
The chairman loved

582
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,440
the school and students
more than anyone else.

583
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,980
I believe not only the students

584
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,010
but also the parents of this school
and the teachers

585
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,780
felt her love.

586
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,190
Her relaxed and warm personality

587
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,760
touched all of our hearts.

588
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,760
[Lord, grant her eternal rest.]

589
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,230
The chairman was like a star,

590
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,730
shining brightly in the night sky
at HSC International School.

591
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,970
A grateful star...

592
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,870
[Lord, grant her eternal rest.]

593
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,610
that led us...

594
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,340
to the right path.

595
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,220
That star has now faded.

596
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,350
I hope Chairman Doh Jin-sol,
who suddenly passed away,

597
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,750
will rest in peace.

598
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,090
We are all lost in grief

599
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,260
by the loss of the deceased.

600
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,990
However, there are many uncertainties

601
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,460
in this tragedy
to send her off peacefully.

602
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,970
I believe all of these suspicions

603
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,100
should be cleared
through police investigations.

604
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,850
In order for our children

605
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,880
to attend this school safely,

606
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,220
I will do my best
and fulfill my duties as a lawyer

607
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,390
and as the mother of a child.

608
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,330
I think that is
what the deceased would have wanted.

609
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,220
She has left us

610
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,490
and has been laid to eternal rest
in the arms of our Father.

611
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,660
You have to help me.

612
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,900
Here I go.

613
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,470
Guys, what are you doing?

614
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,210
-Mom!
-Are you having fun?

615
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,770
Aren't you hungry?

616
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,140
Can't we go home and play?

617
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,540
-Would you like that?
-Yes.

618
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,310
Yi-chan,
I'll make you some delicious food.

619
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,350
Do you want to play
with Jae-in at our house?

620
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,050
Yes.

621
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,920
-Let's go.
-Let's hurry up.

622
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,760
Having lost her,

623
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,030
we are all in deep sorrow...

624
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,670
What are you doing in such a solemn place?

625
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,870
but we are grateful to our Father...

626
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,600
I already told you

627
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,540
to tell me
if there's anything else I need to know.

628
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,480
I gave you enough time.

629
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,580
What?

630
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,750
The conversation you had
with the chairman in her office that day.

631
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,480
I heard it all.

632
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,350
With the HSC International School...

633
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,990
You wanted to have everything your way
after kicking Jae-in's mom and me out

634
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,820
but the chairman
wouldn't let you do as you please.

635
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,230
Is that why you did it?

636
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,800
What are you talking about?

637
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,000
I know you and my husband had more than
an investment relationship.

638
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,340
You're even involved with the foundation.

639
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,610
I'm sure you want to cover it up quietly,

640
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,650
but it won't.

641
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,050
I'll reveal everything from now on.

642
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,020
Reveal everything? How will you do that?

643
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,520
How much do you know about your husband?

644
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,530
You've still got a long way to go.

645
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:19,370
[Jeju Police]

646
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,280
What brings you here?

647
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,950
We're from the police.

648
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,590
We're having a funeral.
Please wait until it's over.

649
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,660
It's an urgent matter,
so get out of the way this instant.

650
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,200
If you don't,
you will be obstructing justice.

00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,830

[Yes, it's mine.]

674
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,340
I dropped it
in the chairman's office that day.

675
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,150
This is Doh Jin-sol's nail.

676
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:21,020
Someone else's DNA was found
under the nail.

677
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,920
And it matches the DNA on the bracelet,

678
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,060
which means it is your DNA.

679
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,800
She yanked at my arm.

680
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,400
-That's why--
-But last time,

681
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,000
you said she was already unconscious
when you got there.

682
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,270
Right, she was.

683
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,900
But she suddenly grabbed me
and fainted again.

684
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,240
Why are you only telling me this now?

685
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,550
There were traces of a drug
on the cup found at the scene.

686
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,920
Digoxin.

687
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,020
It's a cardiac stimulant used
to treat heart disease and heart failure.

688
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,360
She'd had heart failure in the past.

689
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,990
That is why it was prescribed to her.

690
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,000
A drug?

691
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,570
It seemed too suspicious to conclude
that she died from a heart attack,

692
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,030
so we performed an autopsy.

693
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,240
And the amount of digoxin
found in the body

694
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,640
was five times the regular dose,

695
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,040
which means the cause of death
was not cardiac arrest.

696
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,380
Someone overdosed her,
which means she was murdered.

697

she was taking that medicine.

Then how about this?

706
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,910
You received the text message from her

at 6:10 p.m.

708
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,650
Then you called an ambulance
from her office

at 7:45 p.m.

711
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,050
and how long it must've taken you
to get to her office from the auditorium,

712
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,790
there is over an hour
that is unaccounted for.
