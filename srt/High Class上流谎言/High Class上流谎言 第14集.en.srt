817
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,610
and freeze the accounts.

818
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,540
[Ms. Song, if you cancel the transfers,]

819
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:14,080
[the money will be transferred
back to the original account.]

820
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,780
[Is that okay?]

821
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,480
Correct.

822
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,350
I am making this request as the auditor
and the legal representative.

823
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,190
Right, I will take full responsibility
for everything.

824
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:33,930
Because it was never yours.

825
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,730
I only put it back where it should be.

826
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:40,640
Honey, I need that money.

827
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,240
Honey.

828
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,750
It's still not too late. Turn yourself in.

829
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,980
Turn yourself in and return that money.

830
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,090
Then you can make a fresh start.

831
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,060
-So--
-A fresh start?

832
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,000
Yes, I want to make a fresh start.

833
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,970
That's why I came to see you.

834
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:10,670
But you're getting in my way.

835
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,370
Honey! This is a crime.

836
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,770
There are victims.

837
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,440
Do you want to spend the rest of your life
on the run?

838
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,880
Stop being so righteous.

839
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,220
Did you really not know
anything about my life?

840
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,920
All the money I brought to you...

841
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,720
Our clothes, our car, our house,
and Yi-chan!

842
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,120
Where do you think
all that money came from?

843
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,790
Do you know what they did to me?

844
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,400
They stuck to me like a bunch of leeches.

845
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,500
They begged me to make them
as rich as I was.

846
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,640
When they knew nothing
about how to make money!

847
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,810
As long as I make them money,
they're happy.

848
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,840
I risked everything.

849
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,080
Even my life.

850
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:57,780
But as soon as I lost their money,
they called me a fraud.

851
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:00,520
Am I really a criminal? Am I?

852
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,390
That's just ridiculous.

853
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,390
They brought it upon themselves.

854
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,060
Okay, I get it, honey.

855
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,660
There's no reason

856
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,200
I should give them back any of my money.

857
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,870
Do you understand?

858
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,940
Yes, I understand. I get it.

859
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,980
Please don't do this.

860
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,280
How will you

861
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:30,320
explain this to Yi-chan later?

862
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,280
How are you going to face him?

863
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,620
Please, I beg you.

864
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,290
Please don't do this for Yi-chan's sake--

865
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,560
Don't try to appeal to my paternal love.

866
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,360
I love my son more than anyone.

867
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,340
Now, make up your mind.
Come on. You're smart.

868
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,870
Return the money
to the account in Hong Kong.

869
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,810
Then the two of us and Yi-chan

870
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,810
can start over.

871
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,250
Honey, how...

872
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:06,850
Do you actually think that's possible?
Do you?

873
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,560
No?

874
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:13,930
Then what now?

875
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,640
You and I are the only ones here now.

876
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,210
Even if you go missing here,
no one will ever know.

877
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,420
Besides, I'm already dead.

878
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,330
I don't want to be cruel to you anymore.

879
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:50,860
You know that I'm not a patient man.
