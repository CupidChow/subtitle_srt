went to Chairman Doh's office

took her drugged drink and collapsed.

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,230
Dig in. I asked the owner
to prepare it especially for you.


313
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,800
Is it because
you didn't have this last time?


314
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,310
You don't look like you would've been
to the police often.


315
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,380
I forgot you're a lawyer.


316
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
I went there often because of work.


317
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,510
Anyway, you wouldn't have gone
for personal--


318
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,150
No, you did.


319
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,420
This is my third time now.


320
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,360
That reminds me.


321
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,590
Here. I kept it safe,
like you wanted me to.


322
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,930
And from now on, only contact me


323
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,170
through Oh Soon-sang's phone.


324
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,440
Okay.


325
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,940
Let's eat first.


326
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,580
Slow down. You'll get an upset stomach.


327
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,220
I have to hurry up and go get Yi-chan.


328
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,230
Even before anyone can talk,


329
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,570
you're already impatient.


330
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,490
-Yi-chan.
-Mom!


331
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,250
My gosh.


332
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,390
How have you been, son?


333
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,560
Mom, what took you so long?


334
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,130
Do you know how much I missed you?


335
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,300
Right. I'm sorry.


336
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,770
Let's see.


337
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,040
You look like you've grown a lot
since the last time I saw you.


338
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,370
I had a great time at Jae-in's house.


339
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,080
Jae-in's mom cooked us
lots of delicious food.


340
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,580
You're really brave.


341
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,450
-Jae-in.
-Mom!


342
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,720
Yi-chan had fun with us at our house.


343
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,900
Making a false statement
and even taking my kid without permission.


344
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,270
Get ready to be sued
for false accusations.


345
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,930
I guess you don't need me
to settle with you.


346
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,900
I've already been to jail once.
Twice isn't hard.


347
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,070
Let me remind you. Don't you dare
show yourself in front of us again.


348
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,580
Do you understand what I mean?


349
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,140
-Yi-chan.
-Yes?


350
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,070
Did you have a good time
with Jae-in and her mom?


351
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,080
Yes. But it wasn't fun at all without you.


352
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,640
Really?


353
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,920
I'll sing you a song
so listen to it as you watch the stars.


354
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Okay.


355
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:18,290
♫ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♫


356
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:25,230
♫ How I wonder what you are ♫


357
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,770
Mom, the sky is really filled with stars.


358
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,770
Right?


359
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,180
Mom, do you see that shining star?
What's that called?


360
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,410
That's the North Star.


361
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,550
The North Star?


362
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,620
If you get lost,


363
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,750
you'll be able to find your way
with that star.


364
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,790
Really?


365
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,790
Yes. The North Star doesn't move around.


366
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,660
It's always in the same place
in the northern sky.


367
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,900
So if you follow that star,


368
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,800
you'll be walking north.


369
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,870
Really?
I'm going to tell Jae-in about this.


370
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,040
It would've been nice if we came
with Jae-in and her mom like last time.


371
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,640
Right?


372
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,980
Yi-chan, want me to sing it again?


373
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,820
♫ -Twinkle, twinkle, little star
-Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♫


374
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,530
♫ -Twinkle, twinkle, little star
-Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♫


375
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,770
I'm not really good at this.


376
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,610
Tell me why you lied.


377
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,310
If you didn't want to do it,
you could've just said so.


378
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,580
Aren't you going to tell me why?


379
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,220
You lied to me too.


380
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,750
Dad didn't come.


381
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,990
-Dad told us to come here first.
-You're lying.


382
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,160
Yi-chan told me he can't come.


383
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,700
And that I can't see him again.


384
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,470
-Jae-in.
-Do you know how much I miss Dad?


385
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,200
I hate you.


386
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,750
Jae-in, I thought Dad


387
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,490
was definitely going to come


388
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,960
to see the both of us one day.


389
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,760
Dad would never break a promise.


390
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,470
So I wanted to show Dad


391
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,170
what Jae-in was great at.


392
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm sorry.


393
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,450
I didn't mean to lie to you.


394
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,320
I also miss Dad


395
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,750
as much as you miss him.


396
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,660
Mom.


397
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,860
I'm sorry too.


398
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,470
Please forgive me.


399
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,220
What is it? Did you get anything?


400
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,620
Sir.


401
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Thank you.


402
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,490
Sir.


403
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,060
This is the CCTV on the second floor
of the central hallway


404
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,500
half an hour before the blackout
from 6:40 p.m. to 7:10 p.m.


405
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,070
Take a look.


406
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
What is this?


407
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,980
So this is why
she couldn't give us an alibi.


408
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,550
Hold on.


409
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,650
If it takes at least 30 minutes


410
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,690
for the drug to take effect...


411
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,520
What time did we get the 911 call
from the chairman's office?


412
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,060
It was 7:45 p.m.


413
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,330
That means she wasn't there at that time.


414
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,070
-What should we do?
-I'll take care of this.


415
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,970
You call Nam Ji-seon in first, stat.


416
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,140
Yes, sir.


417
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,210
Starting next Monday,


418
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,720
we'll be taking a vacation
to Hawaii for two weeks.


419
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,690
Keep that in mind.


420
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,820
Really? We're going to Hawaii?


421
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,560
What about school then?


422
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,160
Missing a few days is fine.


423
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,030
-I'll let the school know.
-Okay.


424
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,330
What do you mean by a vacation?
It's so out of the blue.


425
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,800
There's the incident at the school...


426
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,600
and the police investigation.
It's all a bit messy.


427
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,300
Take a rest with the kids


428
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,340
until everything settles down.


429
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,910
You should refresh yourself as well.


430
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,980
But I already have surgeries


431
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,710
and golf games scheduled during that time.


432
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,220
You can't miss out on a family vacation.


433
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,720
We have to go together.


434
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,620
I'll tell the hospital to reschedule
the surgeries with another doctor.


435
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,260
The hospital will be fine without you


436
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,160
and you can postpone
the golf games, right?


437
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,130
What is it? Is there something else?


438
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,760
No.


439
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,330
I got it. I'll take a look at my schedule.


440
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm off.


441
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,840
Bye, Dad.


442
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,530
After making that mess at the funeral,


443
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,260
you even got arrested yourself.


444
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,300
Wouldn't it be right for you to step down
as the school's legal advisor?


445
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,600
At the funeral, you told me


446
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,040
that I've still got a long way to go.


447
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,210
Did I?


448
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,780
But I may not have
such a long way to go after all.


449
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,750
I told the police everything I know.


450
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,880
Well...


451
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,750
I doubt I'll be questioned by the police
like a certain someone.


452
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,630
The police would like to interview you
as a witness.


453
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm late for my breakfast meeting.
Let's go.


454
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,580
What a lonely death


455
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,390
for someone who held such a high position.


456
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,290
She didn't know many people
in Korea, but still.


457
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,860
What brings you here?


458
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,490
Why didn't you tell me the truth?


459
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,860
That you were with Mr. Danny Oh that day
at the time of the incident.


460
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,500
If you'd told me,
you wouldn't have been suspected.


461
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,070
What were you trying to hide
by going to all this trouble?


462
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,480
It's just that I left out
anything unrelated to the case.


463
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,580
"Unrelated"?


464
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,610
Lat time, your missing husband
was assumed to have committed suicide,


465

Look into him? Why?


623
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,810
Isn't he close to the chairman?


624
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,450
I don't know the reason yet.


625
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,250
But something must've been fishy.


626
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,750
I got good at reading people
from doing this job,


627
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,860
and there's something
really off about him.


628
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,960
He came forth


629
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,490
as your husband's representative
the moment the chairman died.


630
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,090
Anyway, he's not someone you should trust.


631
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,160
My head is already on the verge
of explosion without your help, so stop.


632
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,370
From what I see,
you're more unreliable than him,


633
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,840
appearing in front of me
and telling me all this.


634
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,370
Am I the one you're doubting right now?


635
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,710
My goodness, I'm losing it.


636
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,890
What do you mean,
I should report my husband's death?


637
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,590
His death was declared
by the police investigation,


638
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,220
but it hasn't been legally processed yet.


639
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,090
It's the request of the deceased.


640
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,330
He asks to be freed


641
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,770
and completely forgotten with death.


642
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,070
You want me to end it after so long


643
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,340
simply for that reason?


644
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,180
That's not the only reason.


645
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,110
To be honest,


646
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,980
you might have not known,


647
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,020
but the foundation and the company have


648
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,580
a debt of 500 million dollars.


649
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,550
Five hundred million dollars?


650
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,290
If you don't report his death,


651
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,890
the soon-to-be-elect chairman


652
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,430
will file a lawsuit for damages
under the name of the foundation.


653
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,830
Chairman Doh Jin-sol prevented
that from happening so far.


654
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,470
What kind of relationship
did the chairman and my husband have?


655
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,450
From what I know,


656
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,850
they've had a special relationship
for ten years,


657
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,290
after the chairman divorced
her British husband in Hong Kong.


658
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,760
Mr. An established
a non-profit organization


659
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,360
to establish the foundation


660
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,800
and appointed Doh Jin-sol as the chairman.


661
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,070
Everything was planned out by Mr. An.


662
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,170
What about the CEO of Locanda Hotel,
Nam Ji-seon?


663
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,670
She's the key investor
and the biggest victim of the debt.


664
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,210
Due to the nature of a mutual fund,


665
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,580
the investor's identity is not exposed,
so she hasn't been revealed.


666
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,050
But for now, she must be holding
the greatest grudge


667
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,320
against Mr. An and the chairman.


668
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,920
How can this happen?


669
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,530
He never once mentioned anything...


670
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,960
How could he let it come to this?


671
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,200
Mr. An must've tried everything
he could to stop it,


672
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,700
but it probably was inevitable.


673
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,100
That may be why he couldn't tell you.


674
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,870
But reporting his death...


675
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,380
Do we have to go this far?
At this point in time?


676
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,450
Well, it's up to you to decide


677

but only you can do it.

00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,220
That's it.


776
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,790
The ones that need to be lit
taste much better.


777
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,890
I'm home!


778
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,460
My gosh, honey!


779
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,870
What's gotten into you?
You're never home this early.


780
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,540
What is going on here?


781
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,870
I had nothing going on today,


782
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,640
so I figured I should come home early
to see you and my son.


783
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,710
I see.


784
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,210
And Chef Jung happens
to be free today as well.


785
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,820
You mentioned a few times
that we should invite him over.


786
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,090
What?


787
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,460
Right, I did say that.


788
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,560
Hello, Chef Jung.


789
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,530
I can't believe you just showed up
without even calling first.


790
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,530
I apologize for coming unannounced.


791
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,370
-Thank you for inviting me.
-Gosh, it's my pleasure.


792
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,440
-Daddy? Dad!
-Goodness.


793
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:44,640
-My son!
-Are you insane?


794
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,780
-How have you been?
-Get out.


795
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,410
You've gotten chubby.


796
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,950
What about my game console, Dad?


797
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,680
Right, I brought it.
I'll give it to you later.


798
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,950
You're the best, Dad.


799
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,150
-Say hello.
-Hello.


800
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,660
Darn it.


801
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,730
Right. A detective called me earlier,
so I spoke to him.


802
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,700
A detective?


803
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,440
Why did a detective call you?


804
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,070
Because of Chairman Doh.


805
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,440
I think they're just interviewing everyone
as a formality.


806
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,110
Gosh...


807
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:28,090
Chef Jung, are you seeing anyone?


808
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,820
Sorry? Well...


809
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,590
No, not at the moment.


810
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,230
Come on! I don't believe you.


811
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:40,300
There's no way
women would leave you alone.


812
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,170
-Right?
-What? Well...


813
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:44,700
I don't know.


814
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,570
I get it. This is a small town


815
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,310
where people watch everything
about everyone.


816
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:52,610
Rumors can't be tamed, you know.


817
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,250
You can be slammed to the ground
once malicious rumors spread.


818
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,220
Don't you agree?


819
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,320
Right, I guess.


820
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,060
Let's see.


821
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,060
How about I set you up with someone?


822
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,130
What's your type?


823
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,670
No, it's okay.


824
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,410
Come on. Don't be shy.


825
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,080
A chef who appreciates fine flavors
needs a fine girl.


826
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,950
Here. Have another drink.


827
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,720
Oh, no. We're out.


828
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,620
My gosh. I'll go get another bottle.


829
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,890
Give me a minute.


830
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,990
Sure.


831
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,400
Have you lost your mind?
How could you come here?


832
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,070
I didn't want to come here either.


833
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,510
Go back before he gets suspicious.


834
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
Wait.


835
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,380
We need to finish our conversation.


836
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,650
What conversation?


837
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,320
About stabbing me in the back
by trying to steal the trademark


838
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,350
and get another woman to invest in you?


839
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,620
-No, you got the wrong idea.
-Don't lie to my face!


840
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,720
Do you want to die?


841
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,360
Get out of my house at once,
before I hit you with this.


842
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,630
Do-yeong.


843
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,940
What's taking you so long?


844
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,080
Well, I wasn't sure which wine
would be the best.


845
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,280
It took me a while to pick one.


846
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,450
This is the same one.
Are you okay with this?


847
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,220
Yes, it's fine.


848
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,520
Where's Chef Jung? Did you see him?


849
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,190
What? Right!


850
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,760
He said the wine gave him a headache.


851
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,090
He stepped out just now.


852
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,860
-Let's go.
-Okay.


853
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:14,620
[Southern Jeju is expecting heavy rain
of up to 50mm per hour.]


854
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,860
[Heavy rain accompanied by strong winds,
thunder, and lightning]


855
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,460
[is expected through the night
into early tomorrow morning.]


856
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,990
Mom?


857
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,490
Mom!


858
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:06,760
Yi-chan.


859
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,000
Yi-chan!


860
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,570
Mommy is here!


861
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
Yi-chan!


862
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,650
Yi-chan, what happened?


863
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,850
What's wrong? What is it?


864
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:27,390
Did the lightning scare you?


865
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:30,220
It's okay. Let's get back inside.


866
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:55,250
What? What just happened?


867
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,120
What was that?


868
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,590
What's going on?


869
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,050
Wait a second.


870
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,790
[High Class]


871
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,130
I'm not going to register
my husband's death.


872
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,030
[I won't use his death
to give myself closure.]


873
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,630
[Why do you get to decide that?]


874
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,600
I'm his legal wife.


875
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:50,400
-Answer me, Yi-chan.
[-Last night must've shocked him.]


876
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:52,100
[He stopped speaking.]


877
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:55,310
[Was it you?
Did you do that to that house?]


878
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,140
[Did you hate me so much?]


879
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,280
[So much that you threw a rock
in the middle of the night?]


880
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,150
[Move out of that house immediately.]


881
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,080
[I saw someone]


882
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,850
[watching your house.]
