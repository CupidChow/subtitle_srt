your husband, CEO An, was deeply involved

168
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,500
in the establishing, donating,
and investing of our foundation.

169
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,930
How deeply, to be exact?

170
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,070
Well...

171
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,640
To the point where Yi-chan was
the first on the acceptance list.

172
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,310
How about that?

173
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,050
Do you mean Yi-chan...

174
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,480
Of course,
it's not just because of CEO An.

175
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,220
Yi-chan is no doubt a great student

176
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,590
that our school is looking for.

177
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,590
I'll make sure your expectations
in choosing our school

178
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,530
are met to the fullest degree.

179
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,730
Trust me.

180
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,300
I swear on my title
as the chairman of the board.

181
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,970
Thank you.

182
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,980
Hello?

183
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,590
Yes, that's me.

184
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,220
Yes, I'll be right there.

185
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,290
There was an English level test

186
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,960
for the students
in the admissions evaluation.

187
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,270
For Class B of Grade One,

188
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,440
the average accelerated reading score
was 1.8

189
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,300
[Evaluation criteria according to
the level of difficulty of English books]

190
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,040
while Yi-chan was 1.0.

191
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,070
That means...

192
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,810
He's below the class average.

193
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,510
Of course,
he's adjusting well to the classes

194
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,850
but supplementary lessons seem necessary.

195
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,890
Right, I get what you're saying.

196
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,760
I'll think about what to do.

197
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,830
How about asking the other mothers

198
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,500
for advice in the group chat?

199
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,130
A group chat? Is there a class group chat?

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,570
I'm sure the mothers shared

201
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,440
their numbers after last night's event.
Didn't you get any message?

202
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,310
Not yet.

203
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,770
Then...

204
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,540
You'll be able to get help
from your buddy mom.

205
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,780
It's a system where students
who moved up from kindergarten

206
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,550
are matched with new students so that
they can help adjust well to the school.

207
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,190
As for Yi-chan... Let's see.

208
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,960
-It's Hwang Jae-in.
-I see.

209
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,890
-She'll soon get in touch.
-Thank you.

210
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080

Gosh. Are you all right?

213

Yes.

Use this.

215
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,980
-No, I'm fine.
-But you're soaked.

216
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,710
It'll dry quickly with the breeze.

217
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,080
You're definitely going to catch a cold.

218
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,050
Use it or not, it's up to you.

219
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,360
But don't treat me like a weirdo.

220
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,990
I'm here to give this back to you.

221
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,660
It was useful. Thank you.

222
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,690
Well, it's just something
I picked up off the ground.

223
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,110
Wait. Do you know how to surf?

224
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,140
No. It just looks dangerous.

225
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,150
And a bit reckless.

226
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,420
My gosh, you're judging it
by how it looks.

227
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
You wouldn't know unless you try it.

228

229

for dangerous and reckless things?

230

Well, I don't have an itch for those.

She's excellent. Such a brilliant kid.

327
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,350
Please teach her a lot.

328
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,830
Also, to the other kids...
You know, right?

329
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,560
Yes, of course.

330
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,400
Between ourselves.

331
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,230
I'm home.

332
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,500
You're home late. Say hello.

333
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,970
This is Jun-hee's English tutor,
Ms. Rachel Cho.

334
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,580
Nice to meet you.

335
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
Oh, I see.

336
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,050
Please teach Jun-hee well.

337
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,190
I'll be going then, Ms. Nam.

338
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,050
Okay.

339
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,100
-Did you have a drink?
-Well, yes.

340
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,800
I grabbed a drink with my colleagues
at a food stall in front of the clinic

341
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,370
after work.

342
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,310
Why a food stall?

343
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,340
For old times' sake.

344
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,150
Do you remember when we first met?

345
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,580
The food stall tteokbokki that we had.

346
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,590
You said you'd never tried soondae before.

347
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,890
I suddenly remembered it,
so I bought some for you.

348
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,730
You were gorgeous back then.

349
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,540
You're drunk.

350
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,240
Go upstairs and rest.

351
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,910
You're flying to Seoul
first thing in the morning.

352
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,340
All right.

353
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,690
Ma'am, please ventilate
the kitchen and the living room.

354
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,570
Let's hurry.

355
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,910
Oh, good morning.

356
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,980
-Are you going golfing?
-Yes.

357
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,210
I'm playing a round this afternoon.

358
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,110
Join me sometime.

359
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,680
My hotel has a pretty nice golf course.

360
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,720
I don't play golf.

361
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,050
-It doesn't really interest me.
-Really?

362
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,060
But there's nothing else to do
around here.

363
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,100
-See you around.
-See you.

364
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,840
Mom, don't you have any friends here yet?

365
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,340
Well, I'll probably make some soon,
like you did.

366
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,210
You should try harder.

367
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,280
It's not fun playing alone.

368
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,180
Okay. I'll try harder.

369
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,890
[Here are the keys to your house.]

370
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,390
Here's the key card
to the shared facilities.

371
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,860
You can find more information
in these brochures.

372
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,090
Please give them a read.

373
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,630
Your terrace and the shared facilities

374
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,200
will be cleaned by our staff.

375
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,300
I see.

376
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,070
You've been here before, right?

377
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,440
No. My husband came here alone
to sign the contract.

378
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,340
Can I get the keys to Building F?

379
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,880
The people went out.

380
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,650
Sure, one second.

381
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,880
Why would you drag your kid
all the way to this island?

382
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,550
-Pardon?
-The development is a good thing.

383
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,420
These days, horses are sent to Seoul,
and people are sent to Jeju Island.

384
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,690
-Am I right?
-Yes.

385
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,230
I'll be going now.

386
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,830
-Thank you for your help.
-Sure. See you.

387
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,670
Why would you say that?

388
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
She's moving into the house

389
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,270
-I told you about the other day.
-So what?

390
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,210
Isn't she the one who came here
with the man who died?

391
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,480
I can't really tell.

392
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,820
The owner didn't add
any emergency contacts.

393
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,720
Then is there no way
to find out the number?

394
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,720
Either someone has to call this number

395
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,730
or the phone has to be unlocked.

396
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,260
Can't you reach the owner of the phone?

397
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,460
No.

398
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,110
Let's go play in the sea.

399
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,620
-Will there be fish there?
-Of course.

400
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,890
We'll catch fish and shellfish
and everything, okay?

401
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,290
Excuse me. My kid and I
are thinking of playing on the beach.

402
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,390
Oh my.

403
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,830
We meet again.

404
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,670
Do you own this place?

405
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,300
You want to play on the beach?

406
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,410
-Do you have some muscles?
-What?

407
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,180
If you do, canoes aren't bad.

408
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,650
But snorkeling is the easiest with a kid.

409
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,650
This is for kids...

410
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,320
But it'll fit.

411
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,890
Here.

412
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,900
You said you weren't into surfing,
but does that look doable?

413
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,530
Right.

414
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,300
So, are you done picking stuff out?

415
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm good but you have a new customer.

416
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,510
-You're not the owner?
-I'm a customer too.

417
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,010
He's an employee and the owner...

418
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,420
There should be a cat.
I guess it went out.

419
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,989
-Call me when my orders arrive.
-All right. Bye.

420
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,230
What's with him?

421
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,900
Thank you!

422
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,699
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

423
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,469
Oh, my.

424
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,310
Move.

425
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,840
-Come on.
-Oh, my gosh.

426
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,340
Gosh.

427
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,590
[-Too bad. We have plans too.
-Sorry, but we can't.]

428
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,060
What do I do? Everyone's busy.

429
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,630
Hey, Yi-chan!

430
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,370
Yi-chan!

431
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,170
How was school?

432
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:18,010
Yi-chan, I'm sorry but all your friends
seem to be busy today.

433
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,750
So how about we go to the beach instead?

434
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,680
Look, I...

435
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,680
I don't want to. I just want to go home.

436
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,660
Why? Did something happen?

437
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
What is it?

438
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,600
Hey, Jun-hee. We can have mango bingsu
if we go to your hotel today, right?

439
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,830
Hey, her hotel's food is the best.

440
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,970
I want 2, no 3 dishes.

441
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,610
Sure. Eat up, you pigs.

442
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,880
Instead, we have to play
Catch the Dragon's Tail in the pool.

443
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,780
I'm not going to play any other games.
Okay?

444
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,650
-Okay.
-Let's play something else.

445
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,120
-I don't want to.
-Guys. Where are you going?

446
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,720
Jun-hee invited us to her hotel.

447
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,590
Guys, what are you doing? Hurry up!

448
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,460
-Mom!
-Mom!

449
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,900
-Mom!
-Goodness!

450
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,530
-Mom!
-Mom!

451
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,170
Why did you say anything?

452
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,680
My gosh. They're so mean.

453
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,310
Yi-chan, we can have
more fun than them on our own.

454
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,920
Let's go snorkeling and ride the canoe...

455
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,350
No! I want to play with my friends,
not you.

456
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,690
All right.

457
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,760
[Jae-in's Mom]

458
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,960
[It's your buddy mom, Jae-in's mom.]

459
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,900
[We'd like to play with Yi-chan today.]

460
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,470
Yi-chan! Great news.

461
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,240
Jae-in can play with you.

462
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,140
-Jae-in?
-Yes. Great, right?

463
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,640
Are you close with her?

464
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,410
An Yi-chan!

465
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,610
-Hi.
-Hello.

466
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,980
Oh, my. Hello!

467
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,960
Thank you so much for the other day.

468
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,390
I couldn't get your name
and it kept bothering me.

469
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,660
Don't mention it.
Things were so hectic that day.

470
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,070
Is Yi-chan feeling better?

471
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,300
Yes, thankfully.

472
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,600
I was worried
because he was really shocked.

473
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,110
-Hi, Yi-chan.
-Hello.

474
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,080
Mom, she's Jae-in.

475
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,380
Jae-in?

476
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,610
By Jae-in...

477
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,850
Oh, my! Are you my buddy mom?

478
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,990
My goodness.

479
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,590
This is great.
I'm really glad to meet you.

480
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,160
-Please take good care of me.
-Likewise.

481
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,030
Anyway, she's going to be busy
if her son wants to catch up.

482
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,340
I'm sure she'll do well on her own.

483
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,570
The mom is a lawyer so she must be smart.

484
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,940
She's surely not your average person.

485
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
She was on the Internet's
top trending list

486
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,110
and her face was all over the news.

487
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,080
Oh, my gosh. She's heading this way.

488
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,650
Hello.

489
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,020
Welcome, Yi-chan's mom.

490
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,090
It seems there's a gathering today.
But I guess we weren't invited?

491
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,430
Jun-hee is really shy.

492
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,570
It seems she's not close with Yi-chan yet.

493
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,340
You understand, right? They're kids.

494
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,880
Of course. There's no way

495
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,080
you would've done that intentionally.

496
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,750
But we have plans too.

497
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,290
Then why don't you go on your way?

498
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,660
Thank you for inviting me,
but what a shame.

499
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,800
Jae-in made promises with Yi-chan first.

500
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,500
I see.

501
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,240
Have a wonderful time
and please invite us next time.

502
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,620
-Let's go, Yi-chan!
-Jae-in!

503
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,220
Wasn't I right?
She's not your average person.

504
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,120
She kept a straight face.

505
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,950
Right, Ji-seon?

506
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,620
Just ignore her.
It's not as if she'll hang out with us.

507
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,690
But why did Jae-in's mom choose her?

508
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,900
Who's Jae-in's mom?
I've never heard of her before.

509
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,900
She's a returnee who came back
from Hong Kong six months ago.

510
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,670
It sounded like
she lived there for a while.

511
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,370
I don't know what she does,

512
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,010
but she has a gallery down south.

513
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,610
Her husband's job is a mystery too

514
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,380
but such a young woman
is busy all by herself.

515
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,850
Now I remember that mom!

516
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,190
I heard people talk about a pretty woman

517
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,190
living alone with her kid
when I went to work out.

518
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,790
They said she's divorced or something.

519
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,690
But seriously, why'd she choose her?
We even invited her.

520
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,300
Stop with the idle talk

521
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,030
and focus on our business.

522
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,280
-Nice shot, Ji-seon!
-Nice shot!

523
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,180
You played every day
and now you're practically a pro!

524
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,710
You should work hard to keep up with us.

525
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,450
If not, you can't join us.

526
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,520
I've never been good at sports.

527
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,320
I came to take photos today.

528
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,990
I'm not just talking about sports.

529
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,790
Isn't that a mesh bag to carry mandarins?

530
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,600
Sorry.

531
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,830
You'll be banned from my country club
if you come looking like this again.

532
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,400
Gosh. You all have no clue
what fashion is.

533
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,670
Take photos for me. Okay?

534
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,680
Too much is as bad as too little.
You always overdo everything.

535
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,550
I'm first.

536
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,150
Wait for me, Yi-chan.

537
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,290
-Hurry up.
-I'm trying.

538

-The kids are so cute.
-This is so much fun.

540

Let's go!

541
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,070
Hey, Yi-chan. There's a lake next to us.

542
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,370
-It really exists.
-I told you.

543
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,570
-Right?
-Right.

544
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,910
-Are you following us?
-Yes.

545
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,210
-This is really fun.
-It is?

546
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,250
Hurry up.

547
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,920
Here I go!

548
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,450
I'm exhausted.

549
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,420
Really? Guys, come back
after you ride a bit more.

550

Be careful!

551
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,900
I'm tired.

552
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,370
It's been a while since Yi-chan
had so much fun.

553

Thank you for bringing us
to such a nice place.

There's no need to be so stiff, Yeo-wool.

I know, but still.

Playing outside is better
than being inside a hotel.

You're right.

558
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,950
To be honest,

559
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,090
I don't mesh well
with those moms and that kind of setting.

560
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,930
They talk too much,

561
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,260
and I couldn't get used to

562
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,430
hanging out together every day like that.

563

And I certainly got on their bad side.

565
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,940
They were so mean earlier
about the kids playing together.

566
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,710
But thanks to that, we were able to come
to such a marvelous place.

is waiting for you.

-Oh, my. I got this.
-No.

577

You should get some rest.

No, I feel bad. Let me do it.

-No, just let me do it.

Hold on. Give me that.

Right. What did you decide to do
about Yi-chan's English lessons?

588

Oh, that. I don't know.

Then how do you feel about
doing joint classes with Jae-in?

590
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,060
She used to live in Hong Kong,
so her English is pretty good.

591
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
If they study together,
it'll be helpful for Yi-chan.

592
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,930
Are you sure? I'd love that,

593

but Jae-in won't gain anything from it.

594

It'll be good for her too.

Yi-chan broke it?

I saw it on my way back from lunchtime.

721

Yi-chan was standing
next to Si-woo's broken drone.

722

Jun-hee, stay out of it.

723

You don't have to pay us back,
but I do want a proper apology.

728
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,310
Yi-chan, is it true?
It's okay, so please be honest.

729
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,920
I won't scold you.

730
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,050
All you have to do is
apologize for your mistake.

731
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,720
Mom, I didn't break it.

732
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,450
Stop lying!

733
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,560
Everything you say is a lie!

734
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,390
No, I really didn't do it.

735
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,200
Yi-chan says he didn't do it.

736
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,530
Maybe there was a misunderstanding.

737
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,030
A misunderstanding?

738
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,040
Then I at least need to hear
an explanation.

739
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,070
He was standing
right next to the broken drone.

740
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,210
He must know what happened.

741
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,480
Well, ladies.

742
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,580
I didn't call you all here
so you could argue.

743
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,480
The children are watching.

744
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,420
Please calm down.

745
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,650
Yi-chan, look at me.

746
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,590
See? He can't say anything.

747
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,920
Calm down.

748
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,260
Gosh.

749
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,730
I guess the rumors were right.

750
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,160
I hear he has

751
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,300
a record of school violence
from his previous school.

752
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,770
Ms. Cha, please...

753
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,640
You're out of line.

754
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,080
-That has nothing to do with this.
-Whatever.

755
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,350
Mr. Han, what are you going to do
about this?

756
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,580
The kids only just started school.

757
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,880
I don't want a kid like him
in my child's class.

758
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,150
I feel the same way.

759
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,890
The situation seems problematic.

760
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,940
Ms. Hwang, hello. What brings you here?

761
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,210
We're in the middle of discussing
something important here.

762
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,880
I have something to tell you
regarding that matter.

763
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,040
That drone...

764
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,380
Yi-chan didn't do it.

765
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,260
Oh, no. This is bad.

766
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,330
What do I do?

767
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,550
Wait.

768
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,080
Hey, Yi-chan.

769
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,430
Well, how did that happen?

770
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,960
I'm sorry.

771
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,170
Jae-in must have envied Si-woo
for his drone.

772
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,870
I'll be sure to compensate enough
for the damage.

773
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,580
The compensation isn't the point.

774
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,910
Your child shouldn't have brought

775
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,680
such an expensive drone to school
in the first place.

776
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,650
This kind of accident was predictable.

777
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,490
Are you blaming my child?

778
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,020
That's just ridiculous!

779
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:42,660
Ms. Cha, I ask you to follow
the rules of the school.

780
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:46,160
Also, please set clear boundaries at home.

781
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,270
What are you talking about?

782
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,000
My child is a victim!

783
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,570
But it's true that Si-woo broke
the school rules.

784
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,980
We'll close the matter
by giving both Si-woo and Jae-in

785
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,080
a proper warning.

786
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,950
Well, I believe we're done.

787
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,520
Unbelievable.

788
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,490
Does this make sense to you?

789
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,130
That's enough. Don't make things worse.

790
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:17,760
-Why should I...
-Do-yeong.

791
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,170
Fine, I have to put up with it
because I'm a celebrity, right?

792
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,340
Let's go.

793
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,530
What took you so long?

794
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,460
Ladies need more time.
Men should understand.

795
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,230
You're just like your dad.

796
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,030
Hold on, please.

797
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,000
What is it? Aren't we done yet?

798
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,310
Please apologize.

799
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:03,010
It was rude of you to suspect Yi-chan

800
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,380
and bring up what happened in the past.

801
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,010
You owe us a proper apology.

802
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,060
Yi-chan, I'm so sorry.

803
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,190
I apologize for what happened today.

804
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,460
Are you happy now?

805
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,130
It's not like I did that on purpose.

806
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,370
Let's go.

807
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,940
Yi-chan.

808
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,150
Did you keep quiet to protect Jae-in
back there?

809
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,310
-Yes.
-You must've been upset.

810
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,250
I didn't understand how you felt.
I'm sorry.

811
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,360
That's my boy.

812
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,360
Thank you for telling the truth.

813
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,800
It must not have been easy.

814
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,370
Don't mention it.
It was the right thing to do.

815
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:06,270
Anyway, I'm relieved
that everything was settled in the end.

816
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,780
Yi-chan, I'm sorry.

817
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,440
It's okay.

818
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,220
There you go.

819
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,290
Oh, no.

820
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,670
I believed
everything would be all right now.

821
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:38,740
I moved here for Yi-chan's sake.

822
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,840
But maybe I was being too laid back.

823
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,410
You only just got here.

824
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,220
The beginning is always the hardest.

825
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,650
From now on,
don't keep everything to yourself

826
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,490
or bottle everything up.

827
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,860
When things get hard,
say so and ask for help.

828
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,160
Learn to rely on others.

829
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,860
You don't only have Yi-chan anymore.
You have me too.

830
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,040
You're right. I have you too.

831
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,370
Rely on me so I can rely on you too.

832
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,110
Two is better than one, right?

833
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,180
They seem to be having a blast.

834
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,890
Jae-in is Yi-chan's first friend here.

835
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,390
He's her first friend too.

836
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,830
Should we be friends too?

837
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,900
Should we do that?

838
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,270
Stop being so polite with me.

839
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,940
-Are we friends now?
-Sure.

840
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,570
I guess.

special attention to the child.

never happens again, Mr. Han.

843

One more thing. How is it going

845
