I'm an actress,

155

to any public schools.

156

You know because of the fame
and useless rumors.

157

and not only that,

159
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,430

161
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,170
I don't plan on forcing my kid to study.

162

Then he can go study abroad or something.

166
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,460
All he needs to do is inherit
his dad's company in the end.

167

are no big deal these days.

168

Very good.

horseback riding, and violin.

Lee Jun-mo's mom.

177

And I'm also the parents' representative
for PTA.

181

Your child is really exceptionally
bright and clever.

182
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,700
Truly outstanding.

183

My Jun-hee just works harder than others.

184
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Why are you applying for this school?

185
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,640
Well...

186
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,410
Since my first child is attending
this school,

187
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,620
I naturally considered applying
for this school for my second child too.

188
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,250
I thought it would be better for
both the children

189
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,390
and myself if the siblings attend
the same school.

190
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,630
Isn't it best to go with what's natural?

191
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,500
Well, her brother is doing well
in this school.

192
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
So I've naturally thought about
her going to the same one

193
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,200
and the crucial reason is that it's good
for my children and me

194
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,640
if they go to the same school.

195
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,970
It's a win-win for all.

196
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,840
No, no. It's good to go with the flow.
That's what I meant.

197
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,010
Oh, it's okay. I understand.

198
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,890
When my husband went to
Stanford University for MBA...

199
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,290
No, I'll just say it in Korean.

200

[Education prior to
entering elementary school]

202
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,800
My major is one thing,

203
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,030
but my Noah is more into music,
especially classical music,

204
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,340
as he has a special talent for it.

205
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,610
I'm thinking of building a portfolio
for him in that regard.

206
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,710
The general election is just around
the corner,

207
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,150
but my husband is very interested in
our child's studies.

208
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,750
They say that a black hen
doesn't need to lay white eggs,

209
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,190
but there's no parent who wants to raise
a child as anything less than the best.

210
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,620
Parents feel the same way.

211
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,460
Also, since everyone attending this school
has high standards,

212
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,770
it would be great for my child
to hang out with similar friends.

213
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,070

Yes, I am.

215
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,510
But I'm in between jobs
due to a personal reason at the moment.

I don't want to say this either, ma'am.

218

I'm really sorry.

222

is especially passionate

229

I'm sure you know Se-joon's father
works at the Central Prosecutors' Office.

230

You're in the legal profession too, right?

231
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,090
It's clear to follow the law, isn't it?

232
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,260
Don't do this. They're still young.

233

Please be generous--

234
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,030
Parents should take responsibility
if the child did something wrong.

235
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,500
Se-joon has a huge cast on his tender arm.

236
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,910
Consider the mental and physical stress
he has been through because of your child!

237

Ma'am.

What should I do to make you feel better?

239
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,680
Have your child

240
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,320
formally apologize to Se-joon.

-Apologize?
-Why, you don't want to?

242

you apologize and make up.

No, I did nothing wrong.

Okay, I got it.

248

He doesn't want to apologize.

249
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,840
I don't like that only my child
has to apologize.

You're saying that it's not his fault?

He's hurt. What are you talking about?

252
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,680
Se-joon started it first.

253
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,150
I heard he fell while trying to push
Yi-chan with a desk.

254
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,890
Of course, not as much as Se-joon,
but Yi-chan also hurt his face.

255
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,530
If you want to get a proper apology,
please make Se-joon apologize too.

256
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,200

so much because of Yi-chan.

children came to school.

Since Yi-chan caused a lot of disruptions
in class,

265
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,020
did you pretend as if nothing happened
when Se-joon and the other kids

266
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,590
were bullying him?

267
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,520
Oh, gosh. What are you talking about?

268
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,830
There must have been a misunderstanding.

269
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,060
Ma'am, that's because
the kids are too young--

270
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,800
Even though they're young,
they know what they need to know.

271
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,800
Yi-chan is not a child who hits
and bullies another child for no reason.

272

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,690
Oh, what's your profession?

320
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm a lawyer.

321
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,990
Oh, I see.

322
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,790
Anyway.

323
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,030
At that school, children have fun in class
and still go to good universities.

324
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,100
Isn't that why you came here
for counseling?

325
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,540
Oh, actually,

326
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,910
we can't afford it or have a big reason
behind the transfer.

327
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,340
Then...

328
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,050
By the way,
is the admission process very difficult?

329
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,120
Well, the number and identities
of admitted students

330
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,980
are strictly confidential.

331
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,990
Firstly, it's not easy to meet
the conditions

332
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,260
let alone passing the test itself.

333
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,260
It's hard to get ready now.

334
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,200
Most kids graduate from
an English kindergarten

335
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,960
and prepare for at least six months
for the test.

336
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,930
Some parents hire
graduates of Ivy League schools

337
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
as tutor coordinators too.

338
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,140
They prepare for the exam
with tutor coordinators?

339
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,640
But your son is aiming
for the junior school,

340
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,410
so there's no separate test.

341
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,040
The first round is application reviews,

342
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,110
the second,
class participation assessment,

343
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,680
and the last third is

344
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,120
a one-on-one in-depth interview
for the kids and the parents.

345
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,580
This last step is the most important.

346
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,850
Gosh, that's a lot.

347
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,460
Do you have any connections with
the school or its foundation?

348
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,200
No.

349
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,230
Do you know any current students
at the school?

350
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,670
No, I don't. Is that very important?

351
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Well, then...

352
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,170
I'm not sure.

353
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,040
To be honest,

354
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,550
[it's not a school where kids get accepted
just because they're smart]

355
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,110
[Success stories of admission]

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,650

[Portfolio preparation course
for Grades 1 to 8]

358
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,170
At that time, we received an invitation.

359
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,510
My child wasn't happy
with his school life.

360
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,550
I hoped to see him
go to school with a big smile.

361
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,620
I don't want him to spend
too much time in academics.

362
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,650
I want him to make friends

363
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,520
and spend more time with me.

364
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,990
I don't think it's too much to ask.

365
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,830
So you've received an invitation.

366
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,500
Do you have any friends
or relatives at this school?

367
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,160
No, I don't have any.

368
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,230
-Any siblings enrolled?
-No.

369
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,300
But I see here that your husband is...

370
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,940
My husband...

371
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,010
He passed away last year.

372
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,950
Then is there any way
to find out who sent it?

373
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,020
No. Usually, we're the ones
who send them, but

374
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,890
nothing was sent out
from our office recently.

375
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,030
Really?

376
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,730
Then who did it?

377
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,160
Maybe someone else from the school
might have sent it?

378
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,900
I see.

379
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,470
Sorry, Ms. Song. I wish I could help.

380
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,000
It's okay. Thank you.

381
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,940
The interview will take a while.

382
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,750
Why don't we go somewhere
and get some tea?

383
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,810
Sounds good.

384
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,120
I own a restaurant nearby.

385
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,190
May I take you all there?

386
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,290
Sure.

387
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,520
Really? That's cool. Let's go.

388
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,310
Wow, it looks fancy.

389
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,210
How did you find this place?

390
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,310
It's like I'm in Carmel-by-the-Sea.

391
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,480
I went there with my husband.

392
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,690
The place looks wonderful.
It has a really nice vibe.

393
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
It opened last month.

394
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,920
I found a chef I didn't want to miss.

395
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,860
Please come often.

396
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,660
My, really?

397
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,430
Do-yeong, you're incredible.

398
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,700
You look after your kid, work,

399
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,070
and even run a business.

400
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,370
It's not like that.

401
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,540
But let's see how things will go.

402
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,440
I'm not sure if Si-woo will cooperate.

403
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,710
He never makes things easy for his mom.

404
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,480
Anyway, it's nice to see you all.

405
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,480
Good job preparing for this day.

406
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
-Good job, everyone.
-Cheers.

407
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,860
By the way, who's the mom
of kid number 35? She seemed...

408
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,770
pretty unique, don't you think?

409
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,600
She'd definitely not fit in with us.

410
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,170
They haven't lived abroad either.

411
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,400
Who cares?

412
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,470
Let's face it, it takes more than
good grades to get into this school.

413
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,150
Okay, then.
Shall we share your thoughts on

414
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,880
why you want to come to this school?

415
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,180
Number 34.

416
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,350
Jun-hee Lee.

417
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,990
Go ahead.

418
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,190
My brother is studying
in this school at the moment.

419
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,730
And my mom is also
the parent representative for this school.

420
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,340
So of course,
I think I should get an education

421
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,170
that suits my level at this school.

422
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,610
Thank you.

423
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,470
Who wants to go next?

424
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,380
-Teacher!
-Yes, number 33.

425
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,910
Si-woo Kwak. Go ahead.

426
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,150
To take over my daddy's game company
and make it the best in the world,

427
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,760
isn't it essential
to have a global education?

428
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,630
Also, my mom told me,

429
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,700
"Si-woo Kwak,
your life totally depends on this!"

430
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,470
"Okay?"

431
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,100
Thank you.

432
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,040
In the interview, they'll look at whether
the kid's attitude and qualifications

433
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,610
will suit the school.

434
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,640
And there's no way to prepare for that.

435
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,550
Are you mute?

436
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,220
Why aren't you saying anything?

437
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,280
[That's true.]

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,290
So sick. I'm so tired of it.

441

To get into a medical or law school
these days,

442
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,600
your kid has to be all set by Grade 3.

443
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,900
Oh, my. Twelve years!

444
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,600
What's the point of
spending all that money

445
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,200
and torturing your kid for so long?

446
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,110
After graduating from
the top medical school,

447
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,840
they end up working for me at my hospital

448
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,080
and getting paid by me.

449
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,380
That's what I mean.

450
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,520
By the way, what do you do
about after-school here?

451
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,360
The school is great,
but I'm getting so nervous.

452
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,860
What about you? We can't just sit back.

453
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,500
English is the first language, right?

454
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,430
The kids need to be prepared.

455
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,670
The first three months will be crucial.

456
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,300
The semester starts in September.

457
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,370
We should start looking for
tutors for the kids.

458
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,940
That sounds awesome. Count me in.

459
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,850
All our kids could be
tutored together, right?

460
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,520
Let's wait and see.

461
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,220
It will all depend on the kids' levels.

462
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,890
Gosh. Come on.

469
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,010
Did you hear anything?

470

If Jun-hee gets in and Si-woo doesn't,

471

it's going to be so humiliating.

Don't worry. Si-woo will be fine.

You have my admiration.

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,770
You don't have to butter me up.

482
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,910
Let's go. The kids will be done soon.

483
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,950
You too?

484
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,290
Nice meeting you.

485
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,630
You too.

486
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,230
Hopefully, we'll meet again.

Sure.

488
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,770
Mom, that kid obviously
has never been to the US.

489
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,840
He doesn't even know
what Universal Studios is.

490
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,650
I told him I got tired of it.

491
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,680
Oh, you mean that fool.

492
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,180
His English pronunciation is terrible.

493
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,750
-So stupid.
-Si-woo.

494
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,660
I told you not to use that word.

495
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,490
But really! It's true.

496
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,590
I did much better than him.

497
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,300
Be ambitious.

498
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,960
Okay.

499
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,530
I'm so proud of you.

500
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,740
-How was it today?
-It was okay.

501
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,580
Okay? What do you mean?

502
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,610
It was just okay.

503
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,690
Yi-chan, even if you don't get in,

504
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,390
let's not be too disappointed.

505
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,790
What do you mean?
I'm definitely getting in.

506
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,460
You want to go to this school so badly?

507
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,630
Yes. You don't?

508
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,270
I'd love that too.

509
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,930
Mom, these are for you.

510
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,460
They're beautiful. Thank you.

511
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,740
Yi-chan, do you want to move here?

512
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,940
Are you sure?

513
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,670
What about your work?

514
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,440
I don't have to work anymore.

515
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,410
I can be with you all day.

516
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Really? Can you promise?

517
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,190
I wish Daddy could be here with us.

518
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,660
Me too. It would've been so nice.

519
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,489
Yi-chan!

-Daddy is here!
-Daddy!

521

Should we go in?

-No! Put me down!

Let's open it later to be real.

Hello, Ms. Cha Do-yeong.

-Is CEO Nam Ji-seon in her office?
-Yes.

An autograph? Give me a pen and paper.

535
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
You need my keycard for the elevator

536
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,300
to go to the CEO's office.

537

Do you need to go this far?

538
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,110
I didn't open it for a realistic reaction.

I'm nervous. What do I do?

540
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,710
Anyway, record it.

541
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,950
Go ahead.

542
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,990

Oh, my gosh!
What kind of situation is this?

550
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,990
What do I do? What am I going to do now?

551
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,590
Turn it off.

552
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,760
Who?
That can't be possible with the capacity.

553
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,060
Who on earth made that decision?

554
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,430
The chairman of the board of directors?

555
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,570
All right. I'll call them directly.

556
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,770
You said he'd get in without any problem

557
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,140
and that you checked the list.

558
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,680
I told everyone Si-woo took
the admissions test at this school.

559
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,350
But since he failed,

560
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,020
I completely lost face.

561
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,620
Calm down.

Unexpected situations
can happen at any time.

563
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,890
Though this was unforeseen
so I'm quite shocked.

564
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,730
Why? What is it?

565
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,600
It seems someone forced their way in.

566

What do you mean? Other than Si-woo who...

567
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,870
Hold on.

568
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,870
Does that mean that person
has a stronger connection than you?

It's good to see you again.

809
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,060
Yes, congratulations.

810
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,130
I didn't think we'll meet again.

811
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,100
Me neither. I look forward
to seeing you more often.

812
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,570
Now, our children are in the same class
and we are neighbors too.

813
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,770
She's right.

814
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:04,510
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

815
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,310
Anyway,
now that things turned out this way,

816
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,750
let's be honest about this.

817
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,650
Who do you know on the board?

818
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,390
I heard you have a great connection.

819
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,560
What are you talking about?

820
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,590
What's wrong with you? It's a good day.

821
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,900
Why? It's not like I said something wrong.

822
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,340
I'll come back after this call.
Wait right here.

823
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,310
Si-woo's mother is sensitive

824
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,480
about issues regarding her child.

825
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,750
I guess she thinks her child
lost out to yours.

826
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,280
Please understand.

827
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,620
What do you mean? Who lost to whom?

828
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,860
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
Yi-chan--

829
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,860
We all have our own stories.

830
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,760
See you.

831
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,610
You don't even speak English.
How did you get in?

832
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,910
Gosh, I'm so bored.

833
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,280
Guys, do you want to play hide-and-seek?

834
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,580
-Sounds good!
-Let's do it!

835
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,620
Hey, let's play hide-and-seek now.

836
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,020
-I'll be "it".
-Okay.

837
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,820
-Go and hide.
-Let's go!

838
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,490
-♫ Go and hide so I can't find you ♫
-Hey, wait for me!

839
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,200
One, two,

840
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,130
-Don't you want to play?
-three, four...

841
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,900
-Me?
-Let's play.

842
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:37,540
Six, seven, eight,

843
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,270
nine, ten.

844
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,540
Here I come!

845
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,840
-Bye.
-See you soon.

846
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,410
Excuse me.
Do you know where the chairman is?

847
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,250
Oh, she was just here.

848
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,390
-You want me to get her for you?
-Yes. Thank you.

849
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:56,690
Okay. Hold on.

850
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,230
-Ji-seon.
-Oh, hey.

851
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,430
Congratulations.

852
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,870
I knew you could do it.

853
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,500
You got both your kids into this school.

854
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,140
Come on. It's just a school.

855
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,610
Anyway, thank you
for coming all the way here.

856
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,750
I wanted to congratulate Jun-hee

857
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,050
and get some information for Se-joon too.

858
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,250
Please share a lot of information
with me from now on.

859
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,590
Wait a second. Is that who I think it is?

860
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,530
What is she doing here?

861
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,170
What's wrong? Who do you mean?

862
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,840
Ji-seon, I mean that woman over there.

863
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,310
What about her? Do you know her?

864
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,660
I didn't expect to see you again,
much less here.

865
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,530
-Hello.
-You're quite resourceful.

866
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,630
What's your secret?

867
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,270
How did your kid get in here?

868
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,000
Do the other moms know
what happened at his old school?

869
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:22,210
That's none of your business.
You're being nosy.

870
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,210
Our kids don't go to
the same school anymore.

871
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,580
How can you be so shameless?

872
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,280
After what your kid did to my son,

873
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,350
you come here and pretend
nothing happened?

874
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,290
Do you want me to tell everyone here
what happened?

875
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,500
You should stop. I know your secret too.

876
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,830
-What?
-Chief Prosecutor Park Moon-taek.

877
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,900
Your amazing prosecutor husband.

878
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,700
He's being investigated
after harassing a female colleague.

879
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,870
Should I tell everyone too?

880
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:59,210
What do you say? Who should go first?

881
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,680
We left that school voluntarily.

882
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:08,690
Don't think you can meddle
in my business and ruin the day.

883
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,860
I'm not letting it slide this time.

884
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,800
Aren't you even ashamed
after killing your husband?

885
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,200
-What?
-She did what?

886
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,700
-She killed her husband?
-What's going on?

887
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,340
-Is it true?
-What did she say?

888
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,140
-That woman killed her husband?
-What happened?

889
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:35,010
-Is it that woman?
-Who is she?

890
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,120
[Murderer.]

891
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,820
-Look at her.
-I can't believe this.

892
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,690
-I'm scared.
-My gosh.

893
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,790
[You remember it, right?]

894
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,190
[Last year, a man disappeared
from a yacht and died.]

895
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:55,130
[Her husband was a famous fund manager.]

896
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,100
[But he died after committing
a ten-billion-won fraud.]

897
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,430
[She was the only one
who came back on the yacht.]

898
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,100
[Her husband's body was
nowhere to be found.]

899
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,740
[She was the prime suspect,]

900
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:09,970
[and she...]

901
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,750
Go hide somewhere else.

902
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,830
-What took you so long?
-Hurry.

903
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,230
Two, four, six...

904
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,240
-Everyone's here, right?
-Yes.

905
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,540
No, Yi-chan isn't here.

906
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,010
Hey, let's go!

907
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,680
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

908
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,950
Hey, move! Get out of my way!

909
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,920
-Let's go!
-Let's go this way!

910
01:00:57,980 --> 01:00:59,120
Wait for me!

911
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,120
Mom!

912
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:10,460
Mom! Help!

913
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,000
Mom!

914
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,740
I'm here!

915
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,070
Mom!

916
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,110
Yi-chan.

917
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,850
Yi-chan?

918
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,370
Yi-chan.

919
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,410
Yi-chan.

920
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,510
An Yi-chan?

921
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,480
Yi-chan?

922
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,290
Yi-chan.

923
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:16,990
An Yi-chan!

924
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,130
An Yi-chan! Where are you?

925
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,570
Yi-chan!

926
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:32,510
Excuse me. Have you seen Yi-chan?

927
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,950
Why are you looking for a boy
in the ladies' room?

928
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,790
Yi-chan.

929
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,990
Yi-chan!

930
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:49,630
Yi-chan!

931
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:55,900
Yi-chan?

932
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,970
Yi-chan.

933
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,710
Yi-chan!

934
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:05,410
Yi-chan!

935
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,350
An Yi-chan! Yi-chan!

936
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,980
Yi-chan...

937
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,750
Yi-chan.

938
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,890
An Yi-chan!

939
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,120
Where are you?

940
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,830
Mom!

941
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,700
Yi-chan!

942
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,710
-Yi-chan! Where are you?
-Mom!

943
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,110
An Yi-chan!

944
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,410
-Mom!
-Yi-chan!

945
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,910
Yi-chan!

946
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,320
Mom, I'm here!

947
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,150
Yi-chan!

948
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,350
Yi-chan, Mommy is here. Hang in there.

949
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,620
I'll get you out right now.

950
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,520
Mom!

951
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,160
Get me out!

952
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,030
Yi-chan, hang in there.

953
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,500
Cover your ears.

954
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,570
I'll get you out in no time.

955
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,140
Hang in there.

956
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,380
I'm almost done.

957
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,450
-Mom!
-My goodness.

958
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,390
Yi-chan.

959
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:25,920
No! Stay with me.

960
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:29,130
Stay with me, sweetheart.

961
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:30,960
Breathe with me.

962
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,930
Do it.

963
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,300
There you go. Good job.

964
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,570
Keep breathing.

965
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:45,610
Mom.

966
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,510
What happened?

967
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,380
Why were you in there?

968
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,520
How did you get in?

969
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,020
I tried to get out,

970
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,290
but the door was locked.

971
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,260
Mom, where were you?

972
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,560
I was so scared.

973
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,470
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

974
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,300
Mommy is sorry.

975
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,370
I was so worried
something had happened to you.

976
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,950
Sweetheart, you don't have to be
scared anymore.

977
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,720
I'll protect you at all times.

978
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:30,290
Okay. Promise me.

979
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,660
I promise.

980
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,330
Were you scared?

981
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,600
It's okay now. Everything's okay.

982
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,130
Let's go now.

983
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,190
[High Class]

984
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,830
[Did you see anyone
before going into the locker yesterday?]

985
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,960
No, I didn't.

986
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,130
[To the others...]

987
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,400
[Between ourselves.]

988
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,700
[Yi-chan did that?]

989
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,600
-Pay me back!
-I didn't do that.

990
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,530
[He has a record of school violence
from before too.]

991
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,170
[Don't worry about it.]

992
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,970
[We have nothing to do with them.]

993
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,370
-We meet again.
[-What's with him?]

994
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,940
[Should we be friends?]

995
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,340
[I believed
everything would be all right now.]

996
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,510
[I moved here for Yi-chan's sake.]

997
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,150
[Maybe I was being too laid back.]
