00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,170
But there might be some if we look around.

168
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,470
Was someone living here before I moved in?

169
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,340
No, there wasn't anyone
besides the owner of the house

170
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,410
and the woman he came with together.

171
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,680
Come to think of it, that woman

172
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,650
came alone about six months ago.

173
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,830
Was it you?

174
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,330
What on earth are you talking about?

175
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,870
Why would I do that?

176
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,840
I heard you came by our house before.

177
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,340
When I first moved back to Jeju Island,

178
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,850
I thought he could be waiting for me
in that house.

179
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,920
[Because he said he'd be outside
waiting for me once everything ended.]

180
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,220
[I thought
he couldn't have died like that,]

181
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,030
[and he'd be waiting for me there.]

182
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,800
Come on in, Na-yoon.

183
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,210
I'm sorry I'm late.

184
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,170
So what? Were you stalking me?

185
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,340
Because I might've hidden him somewhere?

186
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,040
I told you it wasn't me.

187
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,780
I never knew something like that existed
in that house until now.

188
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,250
Come on. It's not unreasonable
considering what you did to us

189
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,620
when we just moved here.

190
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,720
And don't take this the wrong way.

191
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,190
He left the house under Yi-chan's name,

192
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,490
so it has nothing to do with you.

193
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,260
Then leave me alone.

194
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,760
You got the wrong person.

195
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,200
Fine.

196
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,170
I'm determined to find out

197
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,670
what's happening in that house

198
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,470
and who was there.

199
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,520
[I didn't break the window.]

200
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,590
Someone else was there

201
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,630
watching your house.

202
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
[Oh Soon-sang]

203
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,270
It's me.

204
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,940
I need to see Ms. Sim Ae-soon immediately.

205
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,670
Can you find her for me?

206
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,540
Hey, guys. Yi-chan is back here with us.

207
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,080
But keep in mind
that he's not fully recovered yet.

208
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,190
So let's all support him
and help him get better, okay?

209
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,220
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

210
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,490
Sit down, please.

211
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,130
I'll be right back.

212
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,100
Yi-chan, was it nice
to be away from school?

213
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,500
But what was the matter with you?

214
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,840
Why aren't you answering me?

215
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,310
Didn't you know?

216
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,140
-He has aphasia.
-Aphasia?

217
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,780
What's that?

218
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,650
Simply put,
there's something wrong with his mind,

219
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,820
and he can't speak.

220
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,920
What?

221
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,550
No way.

222
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,190
That makes no sense!

223
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,430
Guys, isn't it just ridiculous?

224
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,300
Gosh, exactly.

225
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,830
What do you guys think?

226
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,270
-That makes no sense.
-Seriously.

227
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,530
Didn't you all hear what Ms. Rachel said?

228
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,970
Yi-chan isn't fully recovered yet.

229
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,710
Leave him alone.

230
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,580
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,180
Let's go play with the other kids.

232
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,780
Are you okay?

233
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,020
I've been worried about you.

234
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,790
[I'm okay. Thanks.]

235
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,200
This is fun.

236
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,630
Is it okay if I write something here too?

237
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,280
[I'll make sure
the other kids don't bother you.]

238
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,520
[I'll make sure
the other kids don't bother you.]

239
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,430
I'm your big sister, remember?

240
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,970
Ms. Nam.

241
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,240
We finally meet.

242
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,110
I'm Detective Gu Yong-hoe
from Jeju Police Violent Crimes Unit.

243
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,820
I'd like to interview you
as a witness to Chairman Doh's death.

244
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,820
Do you have a minute?

245
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,490
You need to make an appointment.

246
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,930
The thing is,
I've called her office, her cell phone,

247
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,230
and even your cell phone multiple times,

248
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,800
but you two never picked up.

249
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,330
That's why I came here.

250
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,370
My schedule is extremely tight.

251
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,970
My secretary must've missed it.

252
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,080
Anyway, I'm not sure

253
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,480
if I need to be interviewed.

254
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,250
What do you mean?

255
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,880
I hear that you're digging into
the chairman's death

256
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,550
even though the cause was a heart attack.

257
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,390
You're poking around at random people
without any clear evidence.

258
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,990
Will you be able to handle
the consequences?

259
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,330
In addition to refusing to be interviewed,

260
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,170
are you threatening me too?

261
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,930
No way.

262
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,970
I'm willing to be interviewed...

263
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,470
as soon as you find something on me.

264
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,950
Sure. I'll see you again soon.

265
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,820
No matter what you do,
it won't be easy to run away from me.

266
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,930
I didn't know you were home.

267
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,800
Didn't you say there was
a practice game today?

268
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,070
I quit ice hockey.

269
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,010
What are you talking about?

270
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,640
It's boring. I'm not interested anymore.

271
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,210
The coach is obnoxious too.

272
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,720
Jun-mo.

273
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,980
Don't be like that. If you quit now--

274
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,950
You're annoying. Leave me alone.

275
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,650
This isn't a discussion.

276
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,590
All right. I understand.

277
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,300
But when we get back from Hawaii,

278
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,200
do think it over, okay?

279
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,340
Did you do something to the chairman?

280
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,570
What do you mean?

281
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,410
What would I have done?

282
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,940
Come on. I know you're running away
from the investigation.

283
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,780
I saw a cop in front of our house earlier.

284
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,180
-Are you serious?
-I was just asking.

285
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,150
Then again, you love going on trips.

286
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,620
Hawaii? I can't wait.

287
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,340
Are you leaving, sir?

288
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,840
Yes. Has Captain Gu already left?

289
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,510
Well, I'm not sure.

290

[Violent Crimes Unit]

292
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,050
Gosh, that was close.

293
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,020
The superintendent just left.

294
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,420
I know.

295
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,060
I'm not avoiding him because I'm scared.

296
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,830
How did it go with Nam Ji-seon?

297
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,460
What do you think?

298
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,970
That stuck-up woman

299
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,570
isn't afraid of a powerless cop like me.

300
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,940
Darn it. You know how those people are.

301
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,780
They become hospitalized

302
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,140
and flee overseas all the time.
They think everything will be fine

303
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,850
if they stall for time.

304
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,280
Why don't you just give up here?

305
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,650
I can't do that.

306
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,050
If I keep digging,

307
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,320
I'll come across something.

308
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,860
Aren't you afraid of the consequences?

309
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,190
You can't investigate anything
if you worry about the consequences.

310
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,700
Captain.

311
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,200
Was it last year?
Do you remember the female singer

312
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,540
who died while getting liposuction

313
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,140
at a clinic in Gangnam?

314
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,370
It caused quite a ruckus.

315
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,310
I don't recall.

316
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
What about it anyway?

317
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,840
Turns out,

318
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,950
the surgeon was him.

319
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,750
What are you talking about? Who?

320
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,750
Nam Ji-seon's husband.

321
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Dr. Lee Jung-woo from Eos Plastic Surgery.

322
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,300
Are you okay, Doctor?

323
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,300
Is everything okay?

324
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
She's not breathing!

325

What is it that you drew?

329
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,780
It's from that night, right?

330
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,080
The night it rained and our window broke.

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,990
Yi-chan, what did you see that day?

332
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,630
Who is this, Yi-chan?

333
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,500
Jae-in's mom?

334
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,120
What is it?

335
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,950
Tell Mommy what you saw that day, Yi-chan.

336
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,790
Tell me.

337
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Tell me, Yi-chan. Who is it?

338
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,690
Tell me.

339
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,820
Okay. You don't have to tell me.

340
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,320
I'm sorry.

341
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,390
Mommy was wrong.

342
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,000
I'm sorry. I am.

343
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,730
It's a drawing of his scariest memory.

344
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,240
Did he tell you who it was?

345
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,510
It's probably a memory directly related

346
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,080
to Yi-chan losing his speech.

347
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,150
Ma'am, you have to wait for him.

348
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,920
Even if it takes time.

349
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,290
Until he chooses to speak himself.

350
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,660
-Okay.
-If you're too impatient,

351
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,460
it might get worse.

352
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,960
I understand.

353
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,140
-Go!
-It moves so fast!

354
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,370
-Go!
-Red!

355
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,240
-Go!
-Yes!

356
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,410
-Now, Si-woo.
-Here I go!

357
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,780
-Let's go!
-Wait.

358
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,950
Hey!

359
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,790
-Hit it!
-Yes, it's out!

360
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,690
-Amazing!
-Hit it!

361
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,130
-Yes!
-Yes!

362
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,530
I can do that too.

363
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,800
-No!
-Hit it!

364
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,570
-Yes!
-Should we take that out next?

365
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,050
Yi-chan, I have something to give you.

366
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,850
Give me your hand.

367
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,960
Here.

368
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,760
If something like last time happens again

369
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,330
or if you have anything to say to me,

370
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,970
blow that from now on.

371
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,740
Then I'll run to you
wherever and whenever.

372
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Okay?

373
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,970
Try blowing that.

374
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,110
Nice. That was good.

375
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,520
This is our secret sign from now on.

376
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,650
Okay?

377
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,560
Give me a high five. Yes!

378
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,000
As announced at our last board meeting,

379
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,160
we now have a new chairman.

380
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,930
The actual inauguration will be held

381
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,870
at the upcoming
school foundation day event.

382
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,080
Who is it? The new chairman.

383
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,220
We are here today

384
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,990
to have our new chairman
greet you all in advance.

385
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,470
My goodness.

386
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,500
It's ridiculous.

387
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,170
That mom is the chairman?

388
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,210
How is this possible?

389
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,409
No way! It doesn't make sense!

390
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,409
It doesn't!

391
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,580
What is happening to this school?

392
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,350
You knew everything, didn't you, Ji-seon?

393
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,179
Didn't you hate the sight of Jae-in's mom?

394
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,190
Are you going to let her be like that?

395
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,190
Let's talk later. I'm heading out first.

396
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,900
Why does she always want to talk later?

397
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,480
I was going to tell you in advance,
but it turned out like this.

398
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,020
You're still full of excuses

399
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,120
and lies.

400
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,620
Should I be congratulating you?

401
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,160
I never lied.

402
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,160
You told me

403
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,230
that he left that house
and his will to you.

404
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,700
Look.

405
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,370
This is what he left me.

406
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,110
And it has nothing to do with you.

407
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,610
-What?
-Legal spouse.

408
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,180
You can keep that title.

409
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,110
Since that's everything
you can show off now.

410
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,650
My gosh.

411
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,890
Even if you're blinded by love,
you should watch your mouth.

412
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,960
As a woman, I tried to understand you.

413
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,600
-But...
-Understand me?

414
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,730
Stop kidding yourself.
I never asked you to understand me.

415
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,400
Fine. I won't forgive anyone ever again.

416
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,010
Both you and him.

417
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,370
Suit yourself.

418
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,610
Nothing's going to change anyway.

419
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,380
By the way,

420
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,680
please quit being the legal advisor.

421
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,090
I can't have you stay
as the lawyer of my school.

422
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,490
Of course.

423
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,490
I have no intention of staying either.

424
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,890
That's great news. And one more thing.

425
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,200
You'll soon be sued for the loss
of the foundation's investments

426
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,560
through the board of directors.

427
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,170
Take good care of that.

428
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,270
This is also what he left for you.

429
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,670
Well, congratulations.

430
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,610
Why didn't you tell me anything until now?

431
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,410
Everything was Mr. An's will.

432
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,910
I'm simply a representative.

433
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,410
It's all too sudden.

434
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,480
I'm sure

435
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,020
he had a reason
for giving me this position.

436
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,550
There's nothing to worry about.

437
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,060
You just have to wait a little longer
until everything becomes clearer.

438
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,960
I'll fully support you.

439
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,060
After the inauguration ceremony,
all of this will belong to you.

440
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,940
I'm glad I have you.

441
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,290
What're you playing at?

442
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,260
As if that woman
Doh Jin-sol wasn't enough,

443
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,830
a secret mistress who has no class

444
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,330
is going to be the school chairman?

445
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,560
Relax.

446
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,530
Ms. Hwang Na-yoon

447
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,130
was already registered
as a board member of the foundation.

448
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,740
What do you think will happen
if all of this goes public?

449
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,110
Make your decision now.

450
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,550
On behalf of Doh Jin-sol,

451
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,520
will you take the criminal punishment
for fraud and embezzlement

452
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,920
or will you work with me?

453
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,110
Prosecutor Hwang, it's me.

454
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,180
You must be busy these days.

455
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,750
I'm sorry I couldn't get in touch.
Actually--

456
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,580
Didn't I already tell you

457
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,890
which side I'm going to take?

458
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,030
What you mentioned earlier.

459
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,540
Which overseas capital
are you transferring

460
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,970
the foundation's operation rights to?

461
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,870
They're big players in casinos
and real estate in Hong Kong.

462
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,580
The WanChai Group.

463
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,010
We're still looking

464
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,880
for a Korean negotiator.

465
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,880
Our hotel will participate
as the negotiator

466
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,680
for the transfer of operation rights.

467
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,890
Please connect me to the WanChai Group.

468
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,290
I'm going to personally intervene
in the school's problems from now on.

469
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,800
What's the guests' schedule like tomorrow?

470
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,270
They'll come straight from the airport.

471
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,710
The entire 20th floor of the hotel
has been emptied.

472
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,670
It's such an honor to finally welcome you
to Korea, President Chen.

473
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,210
Wow.

474
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,110
Thank you.

475
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,550
Hey, hero.

476
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,410
Boom.

477
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,850
Shall we?

478
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,650
I trust there were no problems?

479
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,890
Well, didn't it happen on your side?

480
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,190
How could this happen all of a sudden?

481
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,600
We apologize for the frustration.

482
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,570
It was a shock to all of us.

483
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,500
Let's get back to this later.

484
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,640
Traveling in private jets
is still exhausting.

485
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,940
Of course.
We'll take you to the hotel first.

486
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,010
Okay. Honey.

487
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,220
There was a secret room
behind the bookcase.

488
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,420
And there was a staircase right here.

489
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,560
It led to the secret room.

490
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,290
Yes, we did this.

491
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,030
People want to make all sorts of changes
to the layout once they move in.

492
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,800
From what I remember,
this cost them quite a bit.

493
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,670
What was the homeowner like?

494
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,670
-Was it a woman?
-No, it was a man.

495
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,280
It was a man?

496
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Do you remember anything else?

497
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,350
That's right. I thought he was Korean,

498
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,850
but he wasn't.

499
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,620
There are many foreigners
living in that area,

500
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,090
but this is rather an unusual request,

501
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,690
so I remember him.

502
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,100
Then by any chance,

503
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,300
is he in this photo?

504
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,010
Yes. It was this guy.

505
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,180
Look. Doesn't he look like
such a nitpicker?

506
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,680
He kept nagging us to finish quickly.

507
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,080
It was so stressful.

508
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,750
It was Alex Cormer?

509
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,090
He said he was your husband's agent,

510
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,260
so it's no surprise
that he knows a lot about the house.

511
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,630
Perhaps Hwang Na-yoon and Cormer

512
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,570
schemed this together from the get-go.

513
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,510
One as his agent
and the other as his mistress.

514
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,780
If they were planning
to use my late husband

515
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,340
to do whatever they wanted
with the house...

516
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,920
Maybe, good point.

517
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,120
Whoever it may be,

518
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,550
the fact that someone
had been watching us in hiding

519
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,320
makes me livid.

520
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,830
Well, now we at least know
that he was involved,

521
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,260
so let's search his office first.

522
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,100
-I'm sure we'll find something.
-But how?

523
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,770
We'll do it
on the day of the inauguration.

524
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,570
If you can buy me some time
at the reception,

525
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,170
I'll sneak in.

526
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,180
-Illegally?
-Well, that is

527
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,450
my specialty, you know.

528
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,390
Anyway, if that jerk
was actually behind this,

529
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,890
he must have the flash drive
from Chairman Doh's office.

530
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,160
But as for those cameras...

531
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,160
I don't think he was the one
who installed them.

532
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,930
The contractor said

533
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,500
they never installed them.

534
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,170
Really?

535
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,340
And I found Sim Ae-soon.

536
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,440
-She works at a market in Hallim.
-That's great.

537
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,810
She, too,
definitely saw someone that night.

538
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,450
I don't know what she's trying to hide,

539
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,620
but I'm sure she knew Hwang Na-yoon
from before.

540
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,960
As for her daughter
who supposedly ran away from home,

541
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,820
I couldn't find anything

542
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,690
except for this old picture.

543
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,460
I did manage to find
an old classmate of hers.

544
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,910
Is Yi-chan okay?

545
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,280
He seems listless

546
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,340
and depressed these days.

547
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,620
I keep telling myself
that he's getting better,

548
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,380
but I'm not sure.

549
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,350
Too many things have happened.

550
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,900
-What?
-When was the last time you smiled at him?

551
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,100
-Sorry?
-If his mom always looks like this...

552
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,740
You may think that kids know nothing,
but they know everything.

553
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,610
You're all he has right now.

554
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,480
You were always full of energy.
Where did it all go?

555
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,050
You're right.
I was too preoccupied and stressed...

556
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,050
I'm so pathetic.

557
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,490
Well, anyway...

558
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,420
Forget everything else.

559
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,830
Starting today, you will smile at him
at least once a day, no matter what.

560
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,300
Okay?

561
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,770
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

562
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,240
We should smile
especially when things are tough.

563
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,450
[Violent Crimes 1]

564
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,280
Captain, about Danny Oh...

565
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,510
We got the foreigner identity
search results.

566
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:58,420
[Violent Crimes 1]

567
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,750
And? Did you find something?

568
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,180
Well...

569
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,650
It's not him.

570
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,790
What do you mean?

571
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:06,190
Even if he lost a ton of weight,

572
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,460
it's still a stretch.

573
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,360
This little rat.

574
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,230
Request a warrant at once, for forgery.

575
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,470
Got it.

576
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,810
You're dead meat now.

577
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,210
I'll teach you a serious lesson.

578
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,930
It's an honor to have you both
at our hotel.

579
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,500
It's an honor to have you here
at this hotel.

580
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,830
Oh, please.

581
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:51,470
It's our honor to be here.

582
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,970
Henry, you should thank her too.

583
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,780
Thank you for inviting us.

584
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,880
Such a polite and well-mannered young man.

585
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,290
I'm wondering if he can fit in well.

586
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,950
We chose this school for convenience.

587
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,060
The States is just too far for us.

588
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,560
Both of my kids go to the same school.

589
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,630
I'm sure you and your son

590
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,670
will be satisfied with the school.

591
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,730
Both of my kids are going
to the same school.

592
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,640
I'm sure you and your son
will soon be satisfied.

593
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,710
Looking forward to it.

594
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:31,580
By the way, can we have some bulgogi?

595
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,780
Simon, please.

596
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,620
Next time, we should get together again

597
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,650
with my daughter Jun-hee.

598
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,850
Sounds good.

599
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,260
Okay, now...

600
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,930
If we're all done eating,

601
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,900
let's start talking about business.

602
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,670
-Simon.
-Okay.

603
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,070
I'll go check out the casino then.

604
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,340
I hope you have a good time.

605
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,640
Have a good time.

606
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,110
Have fun.

607
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,250
Honey, bring home lots of money.

608
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,390
Keep your mouth shut.

609
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,260
I'm sure Mr. Cormer
has already told you the details.

610
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,500
We're here to discuss
the transfer of the management rights,

611
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,670
but we're hoping for co-investments.

612
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,010
And of course, you'll have
the management rights over the foundation.

613
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,740
I'd like to be guaranteed the right
to participate as a board member.

614
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,420
Is there a reason

615
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,520
I must join hands with you in this manner?

616
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,660
The investment comes second.

617
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:56,800
I'm sure you feel the same way I do

618
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,030
as a mother of a student at the school.

619
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,900
If you must join hands with someone
to get into this business,

620
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,270
I trust that I will be the best person
for the job

621
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,840
since I know the school better
than anyone else does.

622
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,220
Sure. Let's do that.

623
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,850
I hate stalling.

624
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,320
Thank you.

625
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,220
I'm glad we met.

626
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,690
I look forward to working with you.

627
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,830
Likewise. You have nothing to worry about.

628
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,960
I suppose the talk went well, ma'am.

629
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,300
Very well, indeed.

630
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,140
I can finally get rid of those
who annoy me.

631
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,510
You seem a bit drunk, ma'am.

632
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:20,380
I deserve to get drunk on a day like this.

633
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,820
Sit down.

634
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,790
Have a drink with me, Seung-jo.

635
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,000
I don't drink on duty.

636
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,370
This is work too.

637
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,480
Things are finally back on track.

638
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,980
From now on,

639
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,720
I'll let my kids do
whatever they want at my school.

640
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,760
What would you like for dinner?

641
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,160
Instead of dinner,

642
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,530
I crave something else.

643
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,070
Does Mom know you're doing this?

644
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,810
Does Mom know you're doing that
with that woman?

645
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,810
What?

646
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,120
What woman? Who?

647
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:06,690
We're both hiding something from Mom.

648
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,650
Why don't we both look the other way?

649
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,660
Stop being nosy.

650
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,140
This is the first thing your mother
made me without my mom knowing.

651
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,050
It's my favorite toast.

652
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,950
My mom never let me eat
anything with sugar.

653
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,120
-Back then, you were...
-Five years old.

654
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:51,300
I still crave this every once in a while.

655
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,170
Your mother was

656
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,240
the only person in this house
who treated me like a human being.
