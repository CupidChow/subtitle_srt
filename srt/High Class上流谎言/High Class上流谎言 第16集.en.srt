[Song Yeo-wool.]

665
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,900
Hey, do you surf?

666
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,800
Yes, as you can see.

667
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,380
But your posture isn't that great.

668
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,120
What? Gosh.

669
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,020
Are you not athletic

670
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,550
or did you learn from the wrong teacher?

671
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,560
-What?
-What I mean is,

672
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,020
if you're going to do it,

[Danny's Surfing, 80,000 won per day]

675

You have me,

676
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,200
so why did you go learn someplace else?

677
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,900
Are you trying to annoy me on purpose?

678
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,970
You're not supposed to learn things
from someone you know.

679
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,440
Oh yes, is that so?

680
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,310
You sure know how to talk.

By the way, Director Kim made a request
regarding his tangerine farming documents.

Please visit him in the afternoon
and figure out what's going on. Okay?

Pay me for the diver's case first.

684

You're right.

685
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,130
And don't use me whenever you want.

686
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,400
I'm not that free, you know.

687
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,730
I got it.

688

Are you going out on the waves?

Yes, I should.

Oh, my goodness.

Mom, I'll go by myself now.

Alone?

706
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,680
Of course! Only the first-grade kids
go with their moms.

707
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,940
My gosh.

708
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,910
All right. I'll get going then.

we plan to conduct a plastic-free
challenge around the major Olle Trails.

717
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,750
The governor and the city council
also said they will participate.

718

That's a relief.
