1
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:46,159
Doesn't the Han family own a lot of restaurants?

2
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,679
I want to use your channels to sell some liquor.

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,119
Sell liquor?

4
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,679
Young master, do you know that the liquor business

5
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,759
is controlled by the imperial court of our realm?

6
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,600
Only our Han family is allowed to do it.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,760
Privately brewing liquor is a serious crime.

8
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,159
Young Master Xiao, don't let greed cloud your judgment.

9
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,319
I'm not brewing liquor.

10
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,079
Even if I had the skill, I wouldn't have the guts.

11
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,879
It's just that last time at your place,

12
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,120
when I drank that Golden Brew,

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,519
I felt the taste was a bit lacking.

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,480
So I found a few types of liquor myself

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
and made some improvements.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,760
Guess what?

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,680
The taste turned out to be quite unique.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,079
I didn't expect Young Master Xiao to know about liquor.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
I really wonder

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,799
how many more secrets you have.

21
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,640
This liquor—

22
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,599
This is my newly blended Carefree Spring.

23
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,759
Miss Han,

24
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,439
have a taste.

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,719
This is good liquor!

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,360
I've managed the Han family's restaurants for many years,

27
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,840
yet I've never tasted such mellow and fragrant liquor.

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
This liquor and your family's liquor

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,159
are brewed differently.

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,680
Wait—

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,319
It's quite strong.

32
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,199
How can we discuss business if we drink too much?

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
It does feel

34
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,759
a bit warm.

35
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,680
Miss Han

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,919
You can't just back out of this.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,879
If the Prime Minister finds out about this,

38
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,039
my life will be over.

39
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,800
I really underestimated you, sir.

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
If you're willing to sell the recipe for this Xiaoyao Spring

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
to Lingluo,

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,719
my Han family is willing to offer two hundred thousand taels of silver.

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
You already closed my Tea Pavilion,

44
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
and now you want my drink recipe too.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,120
Miss Han, you're really leaving me no way out.

46
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,520
If that's the case,

47
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,520
then I have no choice but to fight you to the bitter end.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,879
The profits from Xiaoyao Spring

49
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,319
definitely far exceed those from making tea.

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,960
Since both the brewing and marketing rights

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
are in my Han family's hands,

52
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,879
he won't be able to escape my grasp.

53
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
No need to talk about life and death.

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,680
I'll have the Tea Pavilion reopened tomorrow.

55
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,680
Sir, please don't go back on your word.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,439
Well...

57
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,960
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

58
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,479
The Tea Pavilion issue is between me and the Su family.

59
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,199
How can I trouble you to step in and resolve it?

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,159
Besides,

61
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,439
even if the Han family says it's resolved,

62
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
what if the Su family doesn't acknowledge it?

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
I can't handle being tossed around by big families like yours.

64
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
Being dragged back and forth like this.

65
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,399
Don't worry about the Su family, sir.

66
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,959
Alright.

67
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,240
I'll trust you this time.

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,879
I can sell you the Xiaoyao Spring.

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
But I can't tell you the brewing method.

70
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,759
Mainly because,

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
this brewing method

72
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,959
is just like the art of tea.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
It's not something you can learn just by being taught.

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
In that case,

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,839
then this Xiaoyao Spring can only be sold to my establishment.

76
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,879
Of course.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,439
I'll trouble Miss Han to prepare for me

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,480
Jinjiang wine, Baili brew, and orange blossom brew,

79
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,040
one thousand jars each of glutinous rice wine.

80
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,680
Very well.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,639
So I can brew Xiaoyao Spring.

82
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,959
It actually requires so many ingredients.

83
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
Young Master Xiao is truly talented.

84
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,319
It only sounds difficult because I made it sound complicated.

85
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,279
Then it's settled.

86
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,439
Young Master,

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,279
may I keep this half pot of Xiaoyao Spring?

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,800
It's been a long time since I had tea.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
It's all the fault of the Court of Justice.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,759
If you ask me,

91
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,439
someone must be

92
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,360
jealous of this Tea Pavilion.

93
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,160
I drink tea from this Tea Pavilion every day,

94
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
and I've never had any problems.

95
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,240
Exactly.

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,399
I wonder when the ban will be lifted.

97
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,519
Yeah.

98
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,720
Wait,

99
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,199
the ban is about to be lifted!

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,000
Really?

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Court of Justice order:

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,199
The Tea Pavilion is unsealed today.

103
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,319
It may resume normal operations.

104
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,439
That's great, that's great!

105
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,160
Wonderful!

106
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,439
Let's go!

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,560
Thank you, everyone.

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,879
Thank you, thank you.

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Congratulations, Young Master Xiao.

110
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you, everyone.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,399
Thank you.

112
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,319
Congratulations, congratulations.

113
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,319
Thank you all for your kindness.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,199
The Tea Pavilion will open tomorrow.

115
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,360
Great, great.

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,759
We can drink it tomorrow.

117
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,399
Yes.

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,199
Let's hurry home.

119
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,839
Let's go home.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,800
Come again tomorrow.

121
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,319
It's finally reopened.

122
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,240
The Tea Pavilion, painstakingly established by the boss,

123
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,879
might end up benefiting the Han family this time.

124
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,800
It's fine.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,759
The losses caused by the Han family to the Tea Pavilion

126
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,319
I'll earn it back through the wine business soon.

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,519
And I'll make them pay back double.

128
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,360
Since the Tea Pavilion was shut down,

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,240
you've loyally stayed by my side.

130
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,560
So the position of manager of the Tea Pavilion

131
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,759
will be yours from now on.

132
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,920
Boss, you must be joking.

133
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,560
Why would I joke with you at a time like this?

134
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,879
Now that the Han family is involved with the Tea Pavilion,

135
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,839
from now on,

136
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,560
you just need to handle deliveries and collect payments.

137
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,040
I have more important things to take care of.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Young Master Han

139
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,319
This isn't what we agreed on before

140
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,279
It's completely different

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,759
That's right

142
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,600
Xiao Ning didn't even give us a single tael of silver

143
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,839
He didn't give our Su family anything

144
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,680
So how did he get released?

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
Madam Su, there's no need to worry

146
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,879
Miss has already taken control of the Tea Pavilion

147
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,439
and secured the marketing rights for tea brewing

148
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,839
Xiao Ning is no longer a threat

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,560
The Tea Pavilion has been taken over by the Han family

150
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
Then our Su family

151
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,160
Isn't it all for nothing, like drawing water with a bamboo basket?

152
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,519
I even told the master

153
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
that once we got the money from the Tea Pavilion

154
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,240
we'd prepare a dowry for Xueyan

155
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,800
so she could marry into the Han family with honor

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,680
Xueyan

157
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Is this true?

158
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,920
This is indeed mother's intention

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,879
Xueyan has suffered a lot with Xiao Ning

160
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,199
There's no reason for the Su family to provide a dowry again

161
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm willing to give thirty percent of Wangjiang Restaurant's profits

162
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,840
as a betrothal gift to the Su family

163
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,279
Wangjiang Restaurant

164
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,519
Wangjiang Restaurant is the top restaurant in Shangdu

165
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,639
Young Master Han

166
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you really mean this?

167
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,759
Of course I do

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,399
Today

169
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,480
I'll show you my sincerity

170
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,159
Good, good, good

171
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,799
Everyone, everyone, look over here!

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,279
Today's new product, Carefree Spring,

173
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,679
is officially being introduced to everyone.

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,759
It's on sale at half price.

175
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,120
Each pot is only five taels of silver.

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,320
Isn't this Young Master Xiao?

177
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,919
Why aren't you managing the tea house?

178
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,320
Instead, you're here at Wangjiang Tower selling wine.

179
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,799
Five taels of silver per pot?

180
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,320
And that's the price after the discount?

181
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,279
No, I won't drink it.

182
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,799
Young Master Xiao, you sell tea for a living.

183
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,720
How could you possibly understand fine wine?

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,080
That's not right for you to say.

185
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,559
This is called expanding into a new field.

186
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,879
I may be unworthy,

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,840
but I'm not only talented at making tea,

188
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,679
I've also made some achievements in wine.

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,919
Young Master Xiao also knows a thing or two about fine wine.

190
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
Of course.

191
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,440
I guarantee this wine is exclusive.

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
It's unprecedented.

193
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,519
Unprecedented.

194
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
That can't be possible.

195
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,279
Young Master Xiao,

196
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,080
all kinds of wine

197
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
can only be brewed from grains or fruits.

198
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,720
Though the taste may differ slightly,

199
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,360
there's nothing truly novel about it.

200
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,039
Young Master Xiao may be talented,

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,320
but you shouldn't boast so much.

202
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,720
Sir, you also know about wine.

203
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,480
He doesn't just know about wine.

204
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Master Chen traveled across many countries in his youth,

205
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,440
tasting the finest wines from all over the world.

206
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
He was even granted the title "Sage of Wine" by His Majesty.

207
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,279
Young Master Xiao, you didn't even know this?

208
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,519
That's wonderful.

209
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,919
On the very first day that Xiaoyao Spring is released,

210
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,919
the Sage of Wine himself will be present.

211
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,320
It will surely sell out!

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,679
Young Master Xiao,

213
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,759
though I love wine,

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,759
I am very particular about its quality.

215
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,480
If this wine isn't good,

216
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,960
I would never praise it against my conscience.

217
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,200
Please drink with confidence.

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,360
Xiaoyao Spring uses Jinjianglao as its base wine.

219
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,960
It has a rich taste and a refreshing aroma.

220
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Its color is as pale as jade.

221
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,720
It will definitely not disappoint you.

222
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,240
Even Jinjianglao is just the base?

223
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,960
Then I must give it a try.

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,919
I want to see what Xiaoyao Spring really tastes like.
