1
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,280
If you’re not feeling well from drinking too much,

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,359
you should rest for now.

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,679
As for dealing with the Han family,

4
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,119
I can handle the preparations myself.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,119
What?

6
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,759
Are we finally going to take on the Han family?

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Why do you sound even more excited than me when it comes to the Han family?

8
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:55,920
What is it?

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,840
Do you have a grudge against the Han family too?

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,039
The Han family is a parasite in Dajing.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,120
The noble families seize land and rule as kings.

12
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,079
They withhold taxes that should be paid.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
They also block the path for commoners to become officials.

14
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,920
All of this is led by the Han family.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,640
If we can bring down the Han family,

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,040
those noble families will never again dare

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,359
to ignore the laws of Dajing.

18
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,200
You sound so passionate about this,

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,959
it’s as if Dajing belongs to you.

20
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,760
I speak for those

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,519
kind and law-abiding citizens.

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
Understood.

23
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,159
I'm planning to split this Jade Nectar Elixir

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
into two parts.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,159
They'll be called Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

26
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,480
Two different flavors of wine.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,719
Yuxian House is known for Minggong, after all.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,599
The Han family has already invested

29
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,079
millions of taels of silver in Xiaoyao Spring.

30
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,040
Once we have our distribution channels ready,

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280
we'll launch both wines at the same time.

32
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,359
Their investment will go to waste.

33
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:00,920
Alright.

34
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,840
Then I'll

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
go contact merchants and shops everywhere.

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,200
Have them get ready to launch the new wines.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,719
Be careful.

38
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,879
Are you okay?

39
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm fine, really.

40
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,159
I know those imperial merchants.

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me go instead.

42
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,680
You're already this drunk.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,759
And you still want to go?

44
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm really afraid you'll mess things up.

45
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,960
He's just worried about me.

46
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,879
Then you be careful too.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
Young Master Xiao,

48
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,919
what happened to you?

49
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,080
Oh, this?

50
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,080
It's nothing, it's nothing.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,800
I just bumped it by accident.

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,599
I wonder why Young Master Xiao

53
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,080
invited us here today.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,120
I have prepared

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,400
a large quantity of wine to sell.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
I would like to use your sales channels.

57
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,080
Don't worry.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,199
You will be fully compensated.

59
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,360
You're too polite, Young Master Xiao.

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,719
Back when we opened the teahouse, Lin and I

61
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,680
made a great profit.

62
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,840
Now that you're willing to

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,479
share the sales rights of Xiaoyao Spring with us,

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,960
we're truly grateful.

65
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,719
That's right.

66
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,120
I haven't even said what kind of wine it is yet.

67
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,039
Young Master Xiao,

68
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,840
no need to keep us guessing.

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,879
Everyone in the city knows

70
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,479
what's most popular right now—

71
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,680
the famous Xiaoyao Spring.

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
To be honest,

73
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,280
Huang and I have been eyeing Xiaoyao Spring

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,879
for a long time.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
It's just that

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,039
we were afraid of encroaching on the Han family's interests,

77
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,680
so we didn't dare act rashly.

78
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,879
Anyway, Minggong Wine and Yuxian Wine

79
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,840
are a hundred times better than Xiaoyao Spring.

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,439
If they misunderstand, so be it.

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,759
I wonder how much wine

82
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,240
Young Master Xiao can provide for our two families.

83
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,879
That's easy to arrange.

84
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,639
He's just a servant of the Han family.

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,919
He can't even produce a single jug of Xiaoyao Spring.

86
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,759
You two shouldn't let him fool you.

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Why is it you again?

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,319
Last time at Wangjiang Pavilion, Madam Su

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,240
was publicly scolded by Miss Han.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,199
We all heard about it.

91
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,560
Your Su family now has nothing to do with Wangjiang Pavilion.

92
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,079
There are no more ties between you.

93
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,920
What right do you have to boss Young Master Xiao around?

94
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,879
See? See?

95
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,439
I told you so.

96
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,560
Miss Han wouldn't play favorites.

97
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,319
The slap I got at Wangjiang Pavilion

98
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,519
wasn't for nothing.

99
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,279
Are you saying Young Master Xiao was also punished by the Han family?

100
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,560
Of course.

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,240
The injury on his face

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,480
was given by Miss Han

103
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,439
as punishment for his disloyalty as a servant.

104
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,199
Exactly.

105
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,399
Last time, he ruined Wangjiang Pavilion's business.

106
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,680
That's why he was so eager to find you two.

107
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,920
He secretly sold Han family's wine.

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Young Master Xiao,

109
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,160
if this wasn't approved by the Han family,

110
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,000
we would never dare touch Xiaoyao Spring.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,560
That's right.

112
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,160
Don't listen to their nonsense.

113
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,959
In this world, besides my father

114
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,600
and that person,

115
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,759
who else could hit me?

116
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,639
Xiao Ning,

117
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,560
at the end of the day, you're just a servant.

118
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,240
I took a slap from Miss Han

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,519
but in exchange, our Su family got

120
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,120
the marketing rights to Xiaoyao Spring.

121
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,360
But what about you?

122
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
In front of both owners,

123
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
can you produce a jug of Xiaoyao Spring?

124
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
Young Master Xiao, can you be honest with us?

125
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,959
Do you actually have

126
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,959
the distribution rights for Xiaoyao Spring?

127
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,759
That's right.

128
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,399
The wine I want you two to help me sell

129
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,959
is indeed not Xiaoyao Spring.

130
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,759
But I guarantee this wine is absolutely

131
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,319
probably unmatched in this world,

132
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
even better than Xiaoyao Spring.

133
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,920
Master Lin, Master Huang,

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
are you two really going to

135
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,120
take something from this young man

136
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,959
when you don't even know where it came from?

137
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,279
Young Master Xiao

138
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,920
Sorry

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,800
Except for Xiaoyao Spring

140
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,959
Our two families will not accept any other liquor

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Farewell

142
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,480
Farewell

143
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,079
Boss Huang

144
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,480
Manager Lin, Boss Huang, please let me finish

145
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,199
Xiao Ning

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,920
I already suspected the matter of fake wine deceiving people

147
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,480
It was you who secretly incited Mother

148
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,800
Seeing you like this today

149
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,560
I realized in my heart that my suspicion was correct

150
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,839
But I don't understand why you would repeat the same trick

151
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,519
And even harm the Huang and Lin families

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,079
Why is it that even now

153
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,639
You still show no remorse

154
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,720
Anyway, in your heart

155
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,199
I'm already someone who lies habitually

156
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,639
Besides, we've already separated

157
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,959
There's no need to explain so much to you

158
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
I have things to do, so I'll leave first

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,399
You—

160
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Manager Huang, Manager Lin

161
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,199
His secret was exposed

162
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,160
He ran away with his tail between his legs

163
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,879
Switching our salt and tea channels to selling wine

164
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,040
was truly a wise move

165
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,959
Our Su family will also surpass the Huang and Lin families

166
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,560
and become the top imperial merchant

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,639
Let's go

168
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,759
Let's go too

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
Where is he?

170
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,920
Young Master Xiao, what are you looking for?

171
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
My lady wishes to see you.

172
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,639
I must be out of my mind.

173
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,879
I actually arranged for the Huang and Lin families

174
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,199
to meet at Wangjiang Tower.

175
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,439
If they discover my plan,

176
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,439
I was too careless, too careless.

177
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,639
Miss Han has summoned me.

178
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,120
How could I dare refuse?

179
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,399
Let's go.

180
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,959
I can't back down.

181
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,160
What does Miss Han want with me?

182
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,519
The wine you bought—

183
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,959
Haven't I already been sending it

184
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,480
to your Han family’s warehouse, box by box?

185
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,360
What,

186
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,519
can't you wait any longer?

187
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,279
Young Master Xiao, you have quite a temper today.

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,839
Could it be that just now at Wangjiang Tower—

189
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,800
She found out.

190
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,759
The manager didn’t treat you well.

191
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,920
Judging by their behavior,

192
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,680
they probably don’t know.

193
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Don’t you know yourself who failed to be a good host?

194
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,079
It’s always you who needs something from me.

195
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,800
And you always insist on calling me here.

196
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,519
That’s convenient for you.

197
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
Have you ever asked what I think?

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
You’re just a servant,

199
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
how dare you speak to my lady like that?

200
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,159
Are you looking for trouble?

201
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,519
As soon as Su Xueyan is gone,

202
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,480
you start acting like this.

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
You—

204
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
Hongzhi.

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
Step back for now.

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,399
At the very least, I am also

207
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,120
one of the founders of Xiaoyao Spring.

208
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,480
The way you

209
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,120
order me around like this,

210
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,399
no wonder people all think

211
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm just a servant of the Han family.

212
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,120
Young Master Xiao is absolutely right.

213
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,440
It was careless of Lingluo.

214
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,840
I know you are exceptionally talented.

215
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,960
That's why I specially invited you here today.

216
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,600
I do have something to ask for your opinion on.

217
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,879
I saw it with my own eyes at the poetry gathering at Yuxian Pavilion that day—

218
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,759
your skills are truly impressive.

219
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,399
Not only did you bring profit to the Tea Pavilion,

220
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,399
you also earned a good reputation.

221
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,519
So for Xiaoyao Spring,

222
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,879
we still need you to work your magic.

223
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,399
Only then can it truly succeed.

224
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,080
Since you insist on going down a dead end,

225
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,279
you can't blame me for what happens.

226
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,399
Not appropriate.

227
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,039
Young master is unwilling.

228
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,240
Since we're selling wine,

229
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,799
of course we need to hold a wine tasting event.

230
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,159
But the sale of these wines

231
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,080
mainly happens in taverns.

232
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,759
It doesn't have as wide an influence as a poetry gathering.

233
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,399
It's just a different way of advertising.

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,039
Why not just make a newspaper?

235
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
Newspaper?

236
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,320
What's that?

237
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,639
I forgot, there are no newspapers here.

238
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,200
Looks like I've come up with

239
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,679
a new way to make money.

240
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,840
We can have the bookshop print some promotional pamphlets.

241
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,320
Then have your servants

242
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,039
distribute them door to door and tell people

243
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,360
that Wangjiang Tavern is holding a grand wine tasting event.

244
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,840
Anyone who attends the event with a pamphlet

245
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,360
gets 20% off all wines.

246
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
This method is excellent.

247
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,879
Are there any other ways to enhance it?

248
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,519
For this wine event,

249
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,279
give it a more eye-catching name.

250
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,519
For example,

251
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,039
"Wine Immortal Gathering."

252
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,919
Invite all the taverns in Shangdu

253
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,399
to bring their wines and participate.

254
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,639
Also invite some celebrities,

255
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,240
like the wine sage Chen Qianlin,

256
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,600
and have him judge each wine in the competition.

257
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,720
And then?

258
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,919
Then,

259
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,879
then,

260
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,600
Xiaoyao Spring will stand out from the rest.

261
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,039
As expected of Young Master Xiao.

262
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,639
This plan is truly brilliant.

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,759
Jiang Yun

264
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,480
Pour me a glass of water.

265
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,600
I'm dying of thirst.

266
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,919
How did the talks go with the Huang and Lin families today?

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,759
How much are they asking for?

268
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,600
Don't mention it, the negotiations fell through.

269
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
The Su family messed everything up.

270
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,879
I'm so angry.

271
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,759
It's hot.

272
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
Miss, why don't I do it instead?

273
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,320
It's fine, it's fine.

274
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,159
Alright, here you go.

275
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,039
So, about what you mentioned before—

276
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:00,360
the promotion methods for Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine—

277
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,559
do you have any ideas?

278
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,639
I have some ideas.

279
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,399
I came up with one for Yan Lingluo.

280
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,919
It's a brilliant promotion.

281
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,879
I'm here pouring tea for you,

282
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,600
but you're coming up with ideas for Yan Lingluo?

283
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,639
What do you mean by that?

284
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,080
Don't be so impatient.

285
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,720
I had Yan Lingluo organize this Wine Immortal Gathering

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,759
to take advantage of the Han family's influence

287
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,960
so that our Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine

288
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,360
can benefit from it.
