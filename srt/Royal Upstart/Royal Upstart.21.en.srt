1
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,079
This is Xiao Ning.

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,600
He doesn't look like a good person at all.

3
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,799
My wife and I are the new managers hired by the owner.

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,719
Manager Bi.

5
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,719
So you were hired by Jiang Yun.

6
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,000
Then from now on, we're on the same side.

7
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,359
Just follow Boss Jiang and do your best.

8
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,520
You'll have plenty of good food and drink in the future.

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,680
Xiao Ning, don't be so unruly.

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,560
Unruly?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,239
When we talked before,

12
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,439
haven't we always talked like this?

13
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,200
Alright.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,959
I wanted to talk to you today

15
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,280
about the new wine promotion plan.

16
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,280
Come, have a seat.

17
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,879
Come on, come on.

18
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,560
Sit down.

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
Just listen to me.

20
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,920
Your Majesty.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,680
Why are you hiding your identity from Xiao Ning?

22
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,640
He seems to be a very calculating person.

23
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,480
We need to keep a close eye on him.

24
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,079
Look,

25
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,640
all these years,

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,159
Yun'er has never been so close to anyone.

27
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,040
If Xiao Ning is really that scheming,

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,239
I'm afraid Yun'er will get hurt.

29
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,120
He wouldn't dare.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,879
Logistics.

31
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,879
Do you understand logistics?

32
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,400
It's about using

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,919
carriage companies and traveling merchants from different places

34
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,960
to build a comprehensive, multi-level wine distribution network.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
What are you looking at?

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,879
Did you understand everything I just said?

37
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,680
Yes, I understood.

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
Talking so much has made me thirsty.

39
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,639
Manager Bi,

40
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,599
go get a pot of tea.

41
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,159
Why are you looking at me?

42
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,080
I said I'm thirsty.

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,879
Thirsty.

44
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,360
I'll do it, I'll do it.

45
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:51,879
Manager Bi.

46
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,479
I have to say something to you about this.

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,479
As excellent service professionals,

48
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,400
we must be observant.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
Otherwise, all the customers would leave.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,080
You...

51
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,599
Manager Bi is the new manager I hired.

52
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,360
He's different from other managers.

53
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,080
He doesn't need to do such things.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,360
I don't agree with what you just said.

55
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,240
Well...

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
There's a saying where we're from:

57
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,560
Do the job that comes with your position.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,039
Since you're in this position,

59
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,240
you should do it well.

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,639
Do the things your position requires.

61
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,159
You can't look down on your own profession.

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Alright, alright, stop talking.

63
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,719
Fine.

64
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,479
Manager Bi, pour some tea.

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,080
Xiao Ning.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Do you know who he is?

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,039
Ning'er, how dare you!

68
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,000
Father.

69
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,080
Do you know who this person is?

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
Could it be that Xiao Hetai

71
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,520
has discovered my identity?

72
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,080
We're all on the same side.

73
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,520
Father, please don't make things more complicated.

74
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,039
I'm teaching Manager Bi how to do things.

75
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,759
You? You're teaching him how to do things?

76
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,599
This is Miss Jiang Yun's father.

77
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:03,960
You

78
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,759
Aren't you the shopkeeper?

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,240
You rude brat with no manners.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,280
Hurry up and apologize to your father-in-law.

81
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,120
Who's his father-in-law? Who's my father-in-law?

82
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Uncle Xiao

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,639
I don't have such a son-in-law.

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
You said yourself that you're the shopkeeper.

85
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,399
Brother Jiang

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,079
I know you and Mrs. Jiang

87
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,160
have been deliberately hiding your identities

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,519
to see if my son Ning

89
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,279
is worthy of Miss Jiang.

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,879
Come, come, please have a seat.

91
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother Jiang

92
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,759
Don't mind that my son Ning acts a bit rashly.

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,199
But when it comes to Miss Jiang,

94
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,199
he is truly sincere.

95
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,720
Even when he's asleep, he keeps mumbling

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
Miss Jiang's name.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,120
Dad

98
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,959
Dad, in front of their whole family,

99
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,959
what are you saying?

100
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,839
Look, look, he's even getting shy.

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Who's getting shy?

102
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,399
Brother Jiang

103
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,759
Look, these two kids are so well-matched.

104
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,680
Who's well-matched?

105
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
Dad, please stop talking.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
Let's settle the marriage as soon as possible.

107
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,040
There's no rush.

108
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,240
I still have a few questions

109
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,519
I'd like to talk to him alone.

110
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
Alone?

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,399
Well, all right then, we'll step outside.

112
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,079
Okay.

113
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,680
Dad, don't just say okay!

114
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Dad

115
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,959
Dad

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Uncle Jiang

117
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,519
Have some tea.

118
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,399
I, um...

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,959
This is our first time meeting.

120
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,519
I didn't really prepare anything.

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,959
Mainly because I gave all my money to Jiang Yun.

122
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,040
What is your relationship with Yun'er now?

123
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,639
We're just friends.

124
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,879
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

125
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,639
Don't think I don't know.

126
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,199
Your real reason for getting close to Jiang Yun.

127
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,399
You just want to use her status.

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
To rise to the top.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
Is that true or not?

130
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,959
Uncle Jiang,

131
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,879
Aren't you being a bit disrespectful?

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,639
Yes.

133
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,079
She's the owner of Yuxian Restaurant.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
I know your family business is big.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,759
You have some money.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,480
But...

137
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,480
I've never spent a single cent of your family's money.

138
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,319
Rise to the top, huh?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
You make it sound like your family is royalty.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
It seems he really doesn't know.

141
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,360
Yun'er's true identity.

142
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,519
Let me give you some advice.

143
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,199
You'd better not have any ideas about my daughter.

144
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,120
Have ideas about her?

145
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
Ideas?

146
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,560
Your Majesty,

147
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Today, I saw that Young Master Xiao is quite handsome and dignified.

148
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,519
He is also clever and quick-witted.

149
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,199
Just as Yun'er described.

150
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,560
What do you think?

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Did Yun'er ask you to come and ask me?

152
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,199
Yun'er is just worried that you might be prejudiced against Xiao Ning.

153
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,399
Am I really that petty?

154
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,879
I admit that Xiao Ning is indeed intelligent.

155
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,800
He also has some insight.

156
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,519
And

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,839
he has a bit of courage too.

158
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,000
Although his words are a bit unusual,

159
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,879
he is still proper and composed.

160
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,439
But even if he has an extraordinary mind,

161
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,360
and great wealth,

162
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,319
in the end, he is just a money-grubbing merchant.

163
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,279
How could he be worthy of Yun'er?

164
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,879
Master, the young master hasn't returned yet.

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
That rascal knows he's caused trouble.

166
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,360
Alright.

167
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,519
Today, I'll just wait here for him.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
I want to see

169
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
when that rascal comes back.

170
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,799
Young master,

171
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,200
Did you really fall out with your father-in-law?

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,360
Don't talk nonsense.

173
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I just...

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,879
I suppose it's just

175
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,240
normal friction between a son-in-law and father-in-law.

176
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,639
I knew it.

177
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,440
You've already considered Miss Jiang as your wife.

178
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,000
How did you know that?

179
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,360
Since you like her,

180
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,200
why not admit it?

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,399
I...

182
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,639
I just haven't figured out how to face it yet.

183
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,080
Go take care of something else for now.

184
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,840
You little brat!

185
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,559
Get him!

186
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,159
Alright, go back and rest.

187
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,919
But, Master...

188
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,000
Young master, young master, you're back!

189
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,679
The master has been waiting for you in the room for a long time.

190
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,080
Who’s there?

191
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,000
Let’s go.

192
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,240
Father.

193
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,840
Dabai, follow me.

194
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,240
Manager Yi.

195
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,480
How is my father?

196
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,240
Although I’ve used bone-setting techniques and medicine,

197
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
I’ve managed to save Master Xiao’s life.

198
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,639
But after all, the old master is advanced in age.

199
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,480
And now his bones are injured again.

200
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,960
When will he wake up?

201
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,600
That depends on fate.

202
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,039
Young master, young master!

203
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,000
I secretly followed them.

204
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,360
Those two disappeared around the Han residence.

205
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,840
That small nation, Beicang...

206
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,759
How dare they provoke the might of our Dajing Empire like this!

207
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,120
Your Majesty.

208
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,120
Beicang has stationed tens of thousands of troops this time.

209
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,360
They keep causing trouble at our borders.

210
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
I fear they intend to march south.

211
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,639
If war breaks out, what are our chances of victory?

212
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,200
I am deeply concerned.

213
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
Last year, our Dajing suffered a drought.

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,399
Now, we are severely lacking in troops, weapons, and provisions.

215
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,080
I’m afraid it’s not wise to start another war.

216
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,600
What good strategy do you have, my loyal subject?

217
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,399
Your Majesty.

218
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,440
Beicang values blood ties and family bonds.

219
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,799
If we send a princess for a marriage alliance,

220
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,279
it will not only avoid disaster and war,

221
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,000
but also get Beicang to help our Dajing

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,960
and eliminate threats from other northern tribes.
