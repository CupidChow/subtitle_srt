1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,000
What?

2
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,759
Han Hongzhi is actually this despicable.

3
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,039
I really underestimated the Han family.

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,520
It seems that what I said last time

5
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,200
they didn't listen to.

6
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,439
Let's enter the palace.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,799
Um,

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,479
sorry about this.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,519
Because I offended the Han family,

10
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,159
this Tea House

11
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,599
probably can't open for a while.

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,040
But don't worry,

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,959
I'll definitely help you find another way.

14
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,760
I'll help you earn your money back.

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,040
I'm the one who should apologize.

16
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,439
I promised to help you with this matter.

17
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,519
Then let's call it even.

18
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,280
This isn't your fault.

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,640
The Tea House has always operated properly.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,760
There's nothing wrong with that.

21
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,439
It's all because of those overbearing noble families.

22
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,640
They're the ones who should apologize.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,680
Exactly.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,599
I was just running my business honestly.

25
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,239
How did I end up offending them?

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,000
Not only did they ruin my business, they also made me a cuckold.

27
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,719
A cuckold?

28
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,359
Yeah, my wife from the Su family, whom I married into,

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
got together with Han Hongzhi.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
How could I, Xiao Ning, put up with that?

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,840
I just divorced her right away.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,239
So, does that mean you...

33
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,239
Don't look at me like that.

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm not sad at all.

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,400
I just can't swallow this anger.

36
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,280
The Han family is very powerful.

37
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,800
In Dajing, everything from food and clothing to housing and transportation

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,719
is influenced by them in every industry.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,479
Even His Majesty can't touch them easily.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,599
So it's because the emperor is incompetent

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,560
that those noble families can do whatever they want.

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,199
How dare you!

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,719
Why are you getting so worked up?

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,039
I wasn't talking about you.

45
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,520
I just think

46
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,960
no matter what, you can't be disrespectful to His Majesty.

47
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,719
The noble families hold too much power.

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,759
His Majesty has his own difficulties he can't speak of.

49
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,680
It's not something

50
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,000
I could possibly know.

51
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,919
So those noble families are just pretending to obey.

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,319
It's not easy being the emperor.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,599
As long as you understand.

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,000
You don't need to worry about the Han family.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
I, Jiang Yun, will definitely deal with them

56
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,080
so they won't dare

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,199
to even think about messing with the Tea Pavilion again.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,039
Don't rush.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,199
I didn't plan for you to take the lead this time.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Do you not trust me?

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,960
If I didn't trust you, would I tell you all this?

62
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,520
The Tea Pavilion is drawing too much attention right now.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Not only does the Su family want it,

64
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,080
even the Wei family,

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,680
the Han family, and even the Huang and Lin families

66
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,919
all want to take over the Tea Pavilion.

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
That's why Han Hongzhi sealed off the Tea Pavilion.

68
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,120
To some extent, I allowed it.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,520
Since those noble families dare to cover the sky with one hand,

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,560
then I, Xiao Ning, will overturn that hand.

71
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,199
I don't fully understand everything you're saying,

72
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,000
but I'm willing to stand with you

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
and defeat them completely.

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
But in this business war,

75
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,680
we should also target the foundation.

76
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,840
Strike at the base.

77
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,560
Hit the snake at its vital spot.

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,439
The only thing I don't know is

79
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,960
what the Han family's most important pillar industry

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,840
actually is.

81
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,400
The Han family's pillar...

82
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,120
I know it now.

83
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,199
Qingfeng.

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,800
This is the Han family's most important business.

86
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,079
Liquor.

87
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes.

88
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,040
The Han family was the first to earn money through brewing.

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,360
Then, in every county of Dajing,

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,879
they took over hundreds of taverns.

91
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,240
Step by step, they became the leading noble family.

92
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,399
But wineries, taverns, and restaurants—

93
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,199
anyone can open them.

94
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,040
So why is the Han family the only dominant one?

95
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,759
Not to mention Yan Lingluo,

96
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,319
who buys large amounts of grain every year to brew liquor.

97
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,879
Their annual income is quite substantial.

98
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
Just a few years ago,

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
the Han family had already secured the brewing rights

100
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,800
firmly in their hands.

101
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,319
Although anyone can open a tavern,

102
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,040
the liquor itself is not easy to obtain.

103
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,160
Even the liquor sold at my Yuxian Tavern

104
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,199
is supplied by the Han family.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,360
That horse stance is really solid.

106
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,800
Not only does the brewing right belong solely to the Han family,

107
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,680
but brewing liquor is not like roasting tea.

108
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,319
The process is extremely complicated.

109
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,959
It might take several months,

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,319
or even years to produce a batch.

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,279
I wonder if—

112
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,720
Xiao Ning.

113
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,639
What are you doing?

114
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,199
Uh—

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Sorry, I couldn't hold back.

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
This liquor tastes terrible!

117
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:41,959
What?

118
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,079
This was bought at the Han family's Wangjiang Tavern,

119
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,759
the top-grade Jinjiang brew.

120
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,319
How could it taste bad?

121
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,680
Are you saying

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,519
this is already the best liquor in Shangdu?

123
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,839
Not just in Shangdu—

124
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,040
this is the best liquor in all of Dajing!

125
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,199
I almost forgot.

126
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,639
There's no distillation technology in ancient times.

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
They just ferment the grains directly.

128
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,959
No wonder it tastes like kitchen waste.

129
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,480
Jiang Yun.

130
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,360
I've thought of a way to deal with the Han family.

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
Give me a few months.

132
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,240
I'll let the people of Dajing

133
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,160
experience the impact of a new kind of baijiu.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,319
By the way, I have one more thing.

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,519
What is it?

136
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,759
Can I stay here for one night?

137
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,120
I've divorced the Su family.

138
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
I definitely can't stay at the Su family's place.

139
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,639
If I go home, it'll just worry my father.

140
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,399
Don't worry.

141
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,680
I definitely won't disturb you.

142
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,759
I never stay overnight here.

143
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Suit yourself.

144
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,839
That's good, then.

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
Not bad.

146
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,079
So early in the morning,

147
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,040
Yuxian Restaurant even serves breakfast?

148
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,399
Coming.

149
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,839
Coming.

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,959
You brat.

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,159
They all said you were kicked out by the Su family.

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I didn't believe it.

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,840
But it looks like it's true.

154
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,919
Don't you run away from me.

155
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,720
Get over here.

156
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,399
I got divorced.

157
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,519
You good-for-nothing.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,559
It wasn't easy for me to find you

159
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
a wife who's both talented and beautiful.

160
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,039
You tore up the marriage contract just because of an argument.

161
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,519
She never liked me in the first place.

162
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,679
And I don't have any feelings for her either.

163
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,679
Did you bring this for me?

164
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,879
I was just worried you’d get kicked out by the Su family.

165
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,840
What if you got hungry and had nothing to eat?

166
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,000
Dad, don't worry.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
From now on, we won't go hungry.

168
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,879
I've got a big business plan ready.

169
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,480
Come on, let's go home and do something big.

170
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,200
Let's go.

171
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,320
Slow down, slow down.

172
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,519
That smells amazing.

173
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,360
Dad, come here, quick!

174
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,720
Is this wine?

175
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,159
I've never smelled wine this fragrant before.

176
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,639
This is my secret to making money.

177
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,679
Here, have a taste.

178
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,559
What's wrong?

179
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,679
Son.

180
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,720
Illegally using grain to brew alcohol

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,039
is a serious crime in our territory.

182
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,919
You must never do this again.

183
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,360
Father, don't worry.

184
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,840
This liquor wasn't made from grain.

185
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,399
I bought some rice wine

186
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,679
and distilled it.

187
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,039
It doesn't break our territory's laws.

188
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,840
Distillation?

189
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,919
How is it?

190
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,879
Good liquor.

191
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,200
Put everything away.

192
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,320
The inn's guest rooms are all ready.

193
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,039
Innkeeper.

194
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,279
Young Master Xiao, do you have any requests?

195
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,440
Bring me ten more jars of Jinjiang wine.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,799
Ten jars?

197
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,360
Young Master Xiao,

198
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,120
just a couple of days ago,

199
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,000
didn't you already order twenty jars of wine?

200
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,840
I haven't heard about this.

201
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,120
Is there a celebration at the Xiao residence lately?

202
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,120
Or maybe he's just drinking to drown his sorrows.

203
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,759
Miss Han.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,639
You Han family still have the nerve to talk?

205
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
If it weren't for your Han family,

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,559
I...

207
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,960
All who come are guests.

208
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,279
Innkeeper.

209
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,399
Quickly prepare good food and wine.

210
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,240
I want to give Young Master Xiao a proper welcome.

211
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,480
Yes.

212
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,039
Last time it was tying up, this time it's sealing off.

213
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,159
It seems Miss Han

214
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,440
is determined to get my Tea Pavilion.

215
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
What happened last time was Hong's recklessness.

216
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,360
If there has been any misunderstanding in all this,

217
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,759
Ling Luo,

218
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,879
apologize to the young master.

219
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,919
The arm can't twist the thigh.

220
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
Your Han family is powerful and influential.

221
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,600
Isn't it always whatever you say goes?

222
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,399
After all, the Tea Pavilion is the young master's hard work.

223
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,840
It would be a shame to keep it sealed off like this.

224
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,240
Last time, the young master said

225
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
there are other owners of the Tea Pavilion.

226
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,519
I suppose Owner Jiang is also aware of this.

227
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,639
So, what does the young master plan to do?

228
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,080
What plans could I possibly have?

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,039
People like Jiang Yun and me are just ordinary folks.

230
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,399
All we can do is resist stubbornly.

231
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,480
At worst, I'll just sell the Tea Pavilion.

232
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,080
Then no one will get it.

233
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,480
Xiao Ning still doesn't know Her Highness the Princess's identity.

234
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,480
In that case, this business will be much easier to discuss.

235
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,759
Young master, you really misunderstood.

236
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,360
Our Han family only wants

237
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,159
to use tea shops across the region

238
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,559
to help you sell your tea.

239
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,960
We just want to earn some commission from it.

240
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,279
We don't want a share of the Tea Pavilion's profits.

241
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,879
You want to be the sole agent for the Tea Pavilion.

242
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,720
With our Han family involved in the Tea Pavilion business,

243
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,559
whether it's the Court of Justice or other noble families,

244
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,879
they'll all have to show us some respect.

245
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,120
This woman is truly skillful.

246
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,840
But her timing is perfect.

247
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,440
I'm a businessman.

248
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,960
As long as there's money to be made, that's enough.

249
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,039
But if you want to be the sole agent,

250
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
you'll have to offer something in return.

251
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,320
What do you have in mind, sir?

252
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
Doesn't the Han family own a lot of restaurants?

253
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,759
I want to use your channels to sell some alcoholic beverages.

254
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Sell alcohol?
