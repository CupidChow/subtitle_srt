1
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,000
Father

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,280
So reckless

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,439
How have I taught you usually?

4
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,280
It seems your stepmother is

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,679
especially lenient with Xiao Ning

6
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
What do you mean by that?

7
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,040
If your stepmother wasn't deliberately letting him off,

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
why has Xiao Ning still

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,959
not delivered the tea house contract yet?

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,040
Instead, he's acting all high and mighty,

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,400
inviting the tea masters from all the major businesses

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,680
to the tea house for a tasting

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,680
Even the Assistant Minister of Revenue and his son

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,719
ended up in prison because of him

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,200
He's truly arrogant

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Hong'er

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
You must not be disrespectful to your stepmother

18
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,280
I just think

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,799
Who does Xiao Ning think he is?

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Even his own wife doesn't like him

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How is he worthy of such glory?

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,319
His wife doesn't like him?

23
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,840
How can you tell?

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,599
Every time his wife sees me

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,280
she looks at me affectionately

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,599
but is very dismissive of him

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,239
How could she like him?

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,480
Prime Minister

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,799
Hongzhi has just given us

30
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,840
a good idea

31
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,359
Luo'er, what good plan do you have?

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,599
Since he has someone backing him

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,159
then let's set a fire in his backyard

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,680
and see what happens

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,199
What do you think?

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,879
It's over, it's over

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,039
Everything is ruined

38
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,479
What should I do now?

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,159
Mother, what's wrong?

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,199
It's all that boy Xiao Ning's fault.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,520
Now the Wei family is finished.

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,719
Even Lord Zhang has been offended.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Our Su family is completely ruined.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,360
What are we going to do now?

45
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,039
Madam, Miss.

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,000
Young Master Han from the Prime Minister's residence requests an audience.

47
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,639
It's over, it's over.

48
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,080
Go and reply to Young Master Han.

49
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,400
Tell him the Su family has important matters today.

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,879
Ask him to visit another day.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,719
Young Master Han.

52
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,240
Where is Young Master Han?

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,159
Hurry, take me to him.

54
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,800
Young Master Han.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,400
Hurry, hurry, quick!

56
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,919
Young Master Han

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,199
Greetings, Young Master Han.

58
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,000
Xueyan

59
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,840
Miss Su, there's no need for such formality.

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Greetings, Madam Su.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
Very well.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,719
Young Master Han, you are truly courteous.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,719
May I ask what brings you here today, Young Master Han?

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,039
What is the reason for your visit?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,639
The spring outing organized by the Imperial Academy

66
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,960
is about to finalize the list of participants.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,400
I was worried Miss Su might miss the deadline.

68
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,280
That's why I came to the Su residence to trouble you.

69
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,840
Well...

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,599
Our family has been busy with affairs lately.

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Xueyan has not yet decided whether to join the outing.

72
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,000
In the past, you loved reciting poetry and going on outings with your friends.

73
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,639
If you don't join this spring outing,

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,680
I'm afraid Hongzhi will lose all interest.

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,959
If Miss Su has any difficulties,

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,839
Hongzhi is willing to help in any way.

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,040
It's all that scoundrel Xiao Ning's fault.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,920
He used the tea house to oppress our Su family's business.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,680
That's why my Yan'er has been too distracted.

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
What?

81
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,759
Xiao Ning, as the Su family's son-in-law,

82
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,920
actually dares to oppress the main family?

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Young Master Han

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,360
The marriage between Xiao Ning and Yan'er

85
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,000
was arranged many years ago.

86
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:51,839
Well...

87
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,800
They are married in name only.

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,920
In reality, they have no real relationship.

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Is that really true?

90
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,040
Mother

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Miss Su is both talented and beautiful.

92
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,879
Yet Xiao Ning doesn't know how to cherish her.

93
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,439
Hongzhi, there's something I don't understand.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,519
Before Xiao Ning married Xueyan,

95
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,040
he was just an idle good-for-nothing.

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,000
He hasn't been the Su family's son-in-law for long,

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,839
yet he managed to open

98
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,480
a teahouse of this scale.

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,720
This...

100
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,759
Where did he get so much money?

101
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
This Xiao Ning,

102
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,800
he must have stolen money from the Su family.

103
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,079
Just watch me report him to the authorities.

104
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,079
According to the laws of Dajing,

105
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,040
Xiao Ning must not only return the Su family's money,

106
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,959
but half of this teahouse should also belong to the Su family.

107
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
I knew it.

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
This teahouse

109
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,279
at least half of it is ours.

110
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,279
Young master, young master!

111
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,279
Something's wrong, young master!

112
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,680
Another group of officers has arrived outside.

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,160
They've surrounded our teahouse.

114
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,079
These officers,

115
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,720
if they don't surround us a hundred times a week,

116
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,120
it's not normal.

117
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,759
No, that's not it—

118
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,439
I...

119
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,759
I'm coming, I'm coming!

120
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,319
Han Hongzhi

121
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,519
What else do you want to do to my Tea House?

122
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,279
Your Tea House?

123
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,079
The Court of Justice received a grievance from the Su family.

124
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,759
The Tea House was established after you married into the Su family.

125
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
It was set up using the Su family's money without permission.

126
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,439
So this Tea House

127
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,639
should have more than half of its ownership belonging to the Su family.

128
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,120
In your region,

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,879
you even have the concept of marital property?

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,720
Besides,

131
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,439
I paid for this Tea House myself.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,560
The Su family didn't contribute a single coin.

133
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,040
You already squandered all the Xiao family's wealth.

134
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,879
Without the Su family, could you have any money?

135
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,399
The facts are clear, no need to argue.

136
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
Seal this shop for now.

137
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,199
We'll decide what to do after the Court of Justice makes a ruling.

138
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,120
Han Hongzhi, I realize that you

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,879
You really are

140
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,720
Dabai

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,240
Dabai

142
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,879
Dabai

143
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,800
Wake up

144
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,000
Dabai

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,439
To tell you the truth

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Killing you

147
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,160
is as easy as crushing an ant.

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Seal the Tea House.

149
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,680
No one is allowed to enter.

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,199
Yes

151
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,519
Dabai

152
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,720
Dabai

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

154
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,199
Let's go.

155
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,439
Today

156
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,240
Thank you, Young Master Han.

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,680
Yaner, there's no need to be so formal.

158
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Call me Hongzhi.

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,679
My feelings for you are as clear as this bright moon.

160
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,639
Sincere and bright.

161
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,440
Could it be

162
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,840
that you want to

163
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,039
burn away my feelings for you?

164
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,919
No.

165
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
Young Master Han, you've misunderstood.

166
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,320
Although I have not shared a bed with him,

167
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,759
we are indeed husband and wife in name.

168
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,639
Xueyan is not worthy of Young Master Han.

169
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,279
Yaner, I don't mind.

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,039
I won't allow you to belittle yourself like this.

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,159
Hongzhi.

172
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,679
Han Hongzhi.

173
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,879
Su Xueyan.

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
Xiao Ning, you still have the nerve to come back.

175
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,039
That's true.

176
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,519
You have nowhere else to go anyway.

177
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,559
Han Hongzhi, don't push people too far.

178
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Where I'm from,

179
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,360
someone like you,

180
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,320
who acts one way in public and another in private,

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,840
would have had their legs broken long ago.

182
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,840
Xiao Ning.

183
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,240
Don't speak so harshly.

184
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,559
You must not be rude to Hongzhi.

185
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Xueyan and I have long been in love.

186
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
If you hadn't forced her with the engagement,

187
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,960
how could Xueyan have married

188
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,720
someone as low and despicable as you?

189
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,919
You secretly meet with another man's wife in the middle of the night.

190
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,000
So that’s not degrading?

191
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,639
You teamed up with the Su family to twist the truth.

192
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,519
Seizing my tea house isn’t despicable?

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,039
Is this how the Han family raised you?

194
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,840
Xiao Ning, you—

195
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,519
How dare you insult the reputation of my family?

196
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,200
You still have a reputation to speak of?

197
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,600
Xiao Ning.

198
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,039
Ever since you married into the Su family,

199
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,080
Ask yourself honestly,

200
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
haven’t all your needs been provided for?

201
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,279
Not only did the Su family not let you

202
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,320
end up destitute after ruining the Xiao family,

203
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,159
they even honored the marriage agreement.

204
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,679
But ever since you joined the household,

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,320
there’s been constant turmoil every day.

206
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,759
I’ve tried to persuade you

207
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,600
not to idle your days away.

208
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,879
Did you ever listen to a single word?

209
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,679
If you could be as refined as Hongzhi,

210
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,240
would I have ended up like this with you?

211
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,519
I idle my days away?

212
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,039
If you look down on me so much,

213
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,600
then your Su family shouldn’t have taken my tea house.

214
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:52,919
You—

215
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,519
And another thing—

216
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,879
If you’re so infatuated with that androgynous person,

217
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,240
why didn’t you divorce me sooner?

218
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,720
Why did you have to make me a cuckold?

219
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,080
You know full well there’s no love between us,

220
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,039
yet you still clung to that marriage contract

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
and forced me to marry into the Su family.

222
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
How am I supposed to back out?

223
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,120
Even though you've suffered some grievances,

224
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,279
compared to me losing a lifetime of happiness,

225
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
what does your suffering even matter?

226
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,159
Don't try to guilt-trip me.

227
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,840
In this kind of marriage,

228
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,679
both the man and the woman are victims.

229
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,799
If I had known it would be like this,

230
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,679
I...

231
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,240
It's too late for you to try to improve yourself now.

232
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,080
No matter what you do,

233
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,120
you'll never be a match for Hongzhi.

234
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,480
You made such a scene today,

235
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,080
isn't it just because you want to use my concern for my reputation

236
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,399
to threaten me?

237
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,679
Let me tell you,

238
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,759
Su Xueyan doesn't want anything to do with you.

239
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,159
I want a divorce from you.

240
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,840
Fine, I agree.

241
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,440
Stop being stubborn, Xiao Ning.

242
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
If you kneel and admit your mistake now,

243
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,120
I might still help you persuade Xueyan.

244
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,679
I only planned to stay at the Su family temporarily anyway.

245
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,960
It's just that you all underestimated me, Xiao Ning.

246
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,840
You...

247
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,039
You ignorant fool.

248
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,120
Don't ever think about entering the Su residence again.
