1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,799
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,840
Beicang values blood ties and family bonds.

3
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,200
If we send the princess for a marriage alliance,

4
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,679
it will not only help us avoid disaster and war,

5
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
but also allow Beicang to help our Dajing

6
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,359
eliminate threats from other northern tribes.

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,760
I ask for Your Majesty's approval.

8
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,000
Dajing truly cannot afford more conflict.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,840
As for the marriage alliance,

10
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,680
you must make thorough preparations.

11
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
It must not be handled hastily.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
My loyal subject, draft the marriage alliance documents for me first.

13
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,719
Then send an envoy to visit Beicang.

14
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,079
Discuss the details of the alliance together.

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,680
I obey Your Majesty's command.

16
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,439
Without the princess,

17
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,200
let's see how you join forces with Xiao Ning.

18
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,560
Mother, please tell Father

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,640
I don't want to marry into Beicang.

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,879
I don't want to get married.

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
My daughter,

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,200
the marriage alliance concerns the safety of Dajing.

23
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,599
It concerns the people.

24
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,759
This is the duty of a Dajing princess.

25
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,520
You must not act willfully.

26
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,120
I will not marry.

27
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,919
Yun'er, you have already come of age.

28
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,919
How can marriage be delayed again and again?

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,159
Besides, the prince of Beicang

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,039
is a man of both talent and virtue.

31
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,840
Compared to Xiao Ning, who only knows business,

32
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,599
he is hundreds of times better.

33
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,400
He will surely cherish you more than Xiao Ning.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,479
Mother, how do you know Xiao Ning wouldn't cherish me?

35
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,000
How do you know he wouldn't treat me better?

36
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,639
If he knew about this,

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,639
he would surely do anything to keep me here.

38
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,719
Your Majesty,

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,360
Do you really insist on Yun'er marrying for alliance?

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Could it be that

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Beicang truly intends to invade our borders from the south?

42
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,159
Beicang moving south—

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,719
Not to mention, Beicang just fought a war with Xize at the start of the year.

44
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,719
Both sides are greatly weakened.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Even at its peak,

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,919
our great nation would never fear such a mere barbarian state.

47
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,680
Do you think I

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,360
am an emperor who relies on marrying off his daughter

49
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,560
to seek peace like a coward?

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,479
Then your insistence on Yun'er marrying for alliance is because—

51
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,800
That Xiao Ning is smooth-talking

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,039
and has tricked Yun'er into falling for him.

53
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,800
I just want to test

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,680
whether he is worthy of

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
Yun'er's feelings for him.

56
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,120
Jiang Yun.

57
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,439
Xiao Ning, I have—

58
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,039
Oh, right.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,159
Do you still have the Minghua Bookstore's distribution channels?

60
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,599
The bookstore?

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, I do.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,680
Why do you ask?

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
Give me the bookstore's distribution channels.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I need to send something out.

65
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,719
That's not difficult.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Xiao Ning

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,759
If

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
If I leave in the future

69
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,160
what will you do?

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,560
Where are you going?

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
When will you come back?

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Maybe I won't come back.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,040
That won't do.

74
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,399
If you're not here

75
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,800
what about the tea, the wine, and the bookshop?

76
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,879
You don't want me to leave because of that?

77
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,040
That's right.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,079
It's such a hassle to find another helper.

79
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,319
Right now I need to teach the Han family

80
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,319
a lesson.

81
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,160
You have to help me.

82
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,279
So, Xiao Ning

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,120
you just need a good helper.

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,759
Or rather

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,480
you just need these businesses.

86
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,879
It's not that it has to be me.

87
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,680
Does it make a difference?

88
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,000
If that's the case

89
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,800
let's just maintain

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,680
a business partnership.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
Whether it's the bookshop's connections

92
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,920
or Yuxian House

93
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,319
or the Tea Pavilion

94
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,800
I'll hand them all over to you.

95
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,519
No, that's not what I meant.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,560
I...

97
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,199
I'm leaving in a few days.

98
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,839
For business matters in the future

99
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,600
just contact Qing Feng.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
Jiang... Jiang Yun

101
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,600
Jiang Yun

102
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,519
Jiang Yun

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
What's going on?

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,720
Yun'er, don't cry yourself sick.

105
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,240
I knew long ago that Xiao Ning couldn't be trusted.

106
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
It's better to see his true colors sooner.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,439
Guards!

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,920
Here!

109
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,079
Take Xiao Ning to the dungeon.

110
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,680
Father!

111
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,040
No!

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,839
Then...

113
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:58,040
Then Yun'er, what do you want...

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,199
Father...

115
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,160
I'm fine.

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,079
That's fine too.

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,160
I agree to the marriage alliance.

118
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,839
I'll go prepare right away.

119
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,000
Xiao Ning, oh Xiao Ning...

120
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,800
How dare you humiliate Yun'er like this.

121
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,399
Guards!

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,519
Here!

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,279
Bring Xiao Ning to see me.

124
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,279
Yes!

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
What's going on?

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,160
I'm just a merchant.

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,360
No...

128
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,079
I'm not qualified to enter the palace.

129
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?

130
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,879
Why does the emperor want to see me?

131
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,040
I don't even know him.

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,759
Miss Qingfeng

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,319
Miss Qingfeng, why are you here?

134
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,240
Could it be

135
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,839
that Jiang Yun has also entered the palace?

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
The Emperor is looking for her too?

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,079
Oh, right.

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,879
Yesterday, I think I

139
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,800
said something wrong and offended her.

140
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,000
Where is she now?

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,160
I need to explain things to her.

142
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,879
No need.

143
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,160
She doesn't want to see you.

144
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,920
Here is the bookstore contract you wanted.

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,160
And all the profit-sharing agreements.

146
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,600
She treated you with genuine sincerity.

147
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
But all you do is make her sad.

148
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,639
Fortunately, she saw your true colors early on.

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,080
What do you mean?

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,440
No, that's not it.

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,519
Your Majesty, Xiao Ning has been brought in.

152
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,159
Yes.

153
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,159
I am Xiao Ning. Greetings, Your Majesty.

154
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,279
Manager Bi

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,039
How dare you!

156
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,159
No way.

157
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:22,039
You—you're the emperor?

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
Manager Bi is the emperor?

159
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,480
Do I not look like one?

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,639
Not at all.

161
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,799
So last time you were traveling incognito?

162
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,000
No wonder the atmosphere was so strange that day.

163
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,559
Did I...

164
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,200
even ask you to pour me tea?

165
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
Yes, you did.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,879
You almost

167
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,360
became the very first person

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,080
to have the emperor personally pour them tea.

169
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
How could I let my father-in-law

170
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,559
pour tea for me?

171
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,000
Who’s your father-in-law?

172
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,480
You’re the emperor.

173
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,399
Then...

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Doesn’t that mean Jiang Yun is...

175
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,440
You dare mention Jiang Yun?

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,519
I’ve never seen Yun’er

177
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,240
cry so sadly before.

178
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,200
You broke her heart.

179
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,480
I...

180
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,840
I wish I could take your head off.

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,320
Why are you and your daughter so alike?

182
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,399
Your Majesty.

183
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,440
Last time, I got my conversation with Jiang Yun all mixed up.

184
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,399
Call her out here.

185
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,240
I want to explain things to her.

186
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
You don’t deserve to see her.

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,159
That's fine too.

188
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,759
Since you have no feelings for Yun'er,

189
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,360
this will help her give up hope.

190
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,720
Going to Beicang for the marriage alliance

191
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,720
is also a clear path forward.

192
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,600
Jiang Yun is going to marry for alliance.

193
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
What about Xiao Ning?

194
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,919
Your Highness, please don't worry.

195
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,360
His Majesty is currently speaking with Young Master Xiao.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,799
Princess,

197
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,840
His Majesty won't do anything to Young Master Xiao.

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,679
In this old servant's opinion,

199
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,000
it's better if Your Highness doesn't go in.

200
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
Please stay here

201
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
and listen to what Young Master Xiao has to say.

202
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,159
Who says I don't care?

203
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,679
You spoiled brat.

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
As a father,

205
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,240
how could you send your daughter away for a political marriage,

206
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,720
ruining her entire life's happiness?

207
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,879
I really have nothing to say to you.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,840
No wonder the noble families of Dajing

209
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,720
are so arrogant nowadays.

210
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,000
How dare you!

211
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,759
Enough.

212
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,000
Besides shouting "How dare you, how dare you,"

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,960
is there anything else you can say?

214
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,519
You—

215
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Right now, the Han family leads the noble clans.

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
They rely on their size and think they're untouchable.

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,720
Not only do they dare to take lives at will,

218
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,919
they even control the court.

219
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,440
They influence Your Majesty's decisions.

220
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,919
If these parasites aren't removed,

221
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,039
I fear Dajing itself will soon collapse.

222
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,120
Do you think you're the only capable person in Dajing?

223
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,360
Do you think I've grown blind with age,

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,960
and raised a court full of useless fools?

225
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,399
Since I dare to say this,

226
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,240
I naturally have my own solution.

227
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Your Majesty, there's no need to test me.

228
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,360
What do you mean by that?

229
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,360
I know Your Majesty is well aware,

230
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,440
that the current court

231
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
is already controlled by the noble families.

232
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,320
Your Majesty must be tired of it as well.

233
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,360
If I had a way

234
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,120
to wipe out all the noble families at once,

235
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,600
would Your Majesty be willing to act?

236
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,720
Xiao Ning

237
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,159
I know you have some business sense.

238
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,320
But your methods

239
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,879
when placed in the court

240
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,200
are nothing more than petty tricks.

241
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,200
The noble families have lasted for centuries.

242
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,799
Trade and taxes

243
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,240
and government officials

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,399
are mostly under their control.

245
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,799
You could say

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
the foundation of Dajing

247
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
is indeed built upon the noble families.

248
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,159
Even after decades of my efforts, I have not succeeded.

249
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,480
What can you, a commoner, possibly do?

250
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,399
Your Majesty, you are mistaken.

251
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,919
The true foundation of Dajing is not

252
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,480
those domineering noble families.

253
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,559
It is the honest merchants

254
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,759
and the common people.

255
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,039
Only by truly removing

256
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,799
the influence of the noble families from the court

257
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,919
can Dajing

258
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,279
truly be revived.

259
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,519
That's easier said than done.

260
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,799
On the court, eight or nine out of ten

261
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,279
have ties to noble families.

262
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,639
How can we remove them?

263
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,519
By appointing talented people from humble backgrounds

264
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
to replace the useless scions of noble families.

265
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,840
That way, the crisis in the court can be resolved.

266
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,799
Of course I know that.

267
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,639
Promoting the talented from humble origins is the right path.

268
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
But the Imperial Academy

269
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,919
and the civil service exams, the two paths to office,

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,879
are both controlled by the noble families.

271
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,600
Where is there another way?

272
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,679
Newspapers.

273
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,399
Newspapers are the new path.
