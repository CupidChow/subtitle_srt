1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,439
Yun'er

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,439
You didn't come home all night yesterday.

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,920
Where did you go?

4
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,920
Yesterday...

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
I spent the night at Yuxian Pavilion yesterday.

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,240
You're acting a bit strange.

7
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:02,600
Did something happen?

8
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,640
No, no, nothing happened.

9
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,879
Yesterday, I...

10
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,799
All day today,

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,120
All day yesterday,

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,599
I was with Qingfeng the whole time.

13
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,159
Nothing happened at all.

14
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,680
Why is your face so red?

15
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,519
Could it be that you've caught a cold?

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,319
No, not at all.

17
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,760
I'm doing just fine.

18
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,799
Alright, alright.

19
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,840
I called you here just to ask you something.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,239
What do you think of that Xiao Ning?

21
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,519
Yun'er.

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know.

23
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,400
Xiao Ning is quite nice.

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,560
What nonsense.

25
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,280
Your father just wants to remind you.

26
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,760
Xiao Ning is very scheming.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,959
You must not let him fool you.

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,959
Xiao Ning would trick me?

29
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,280
Father, why do you say that?

30
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,239
That Xiao Ning secretly brewed a

31
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,159
new wine called Xiaoyao Spring.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
It's supplied exclusively to the Han family's tavern.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,479
In just a few days, it has already

34
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,000
earned the Han family ten thousand taels of silver.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,319
I know about this.

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,599
You know?

37
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,360
Xiao Ning siding with the Han family is going against the royal family.

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,039
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,159
Father, you've misunderstood.

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,000
Xiao Ning wants to use Xiaoyao Spring

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
to gain the Han family's trust.

42
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,360
Then I'll use even better wine

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,039
to completely defeat the Han family's tavern.

44
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,000
Xiaoyao Spring has already gained the Han family's trust.

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,719
Let them spend a few more million taels stockpiling goods.

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,439
Then I'll have Jade Nectar Dew

47
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
beat them so badly they won't know what hit them.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Everyone, stop right now.

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,919
Put it here.

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,759
Madam Su, the dining area is in the front hall.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,759
What are you doing in the backyard?

52
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,879
My Su family is also the owner of Wangjiang Tower.

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,159
Is there a problem with me coming to my own backyard?

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
No problem, go ahead and look around.

55
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,120
Get to work.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
What are you all doing?

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,240
He's just a hired hand.

58
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,719
You all have to listen to me.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,199
Then what are your instructions, boss?

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,639
I want you to open all these jars of wine.

61
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,840
Add thirty percent well water to them.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,319
This...

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,599
You're making fake wine.

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
The customers will find out.

65
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,919
And you call yourself a merchant.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,280
Xiaoyao Spring is hard to come by these days.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
If we don't find a way to sell more,

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,159
how will my Wangjiang Tower make money?

69
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
Faking things like this

70
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,560
will ruin the Han family's reputation.

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,439
I don't care.

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,960
Xiaoyao Spring is a strong liquor.

73
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,199
Add thirty percent well water to it,

74
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,639
and no one will be able to tell.

75
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,599
Add it for me.

76
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,840
Go ahead, add it.

77
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,520
Hurry up.

78
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,960
That's right.

79
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,879
Yes, yes, yes.

80
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,520
You reap what you sow.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,759
The wine in this warehouse

82
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,480
is supposed to be shipped to the capital.

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,079
All of Han Family's restaurants'

84
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,079
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,920
Add it, add it.

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Add more, more, more!

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,319
Add it.

88
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,879
This taste isn't right.

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
Xiaoyao Spring doesn't taste like this.

90
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,319
Where's your manager?

91
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,519
Hurry up and come out!

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
Is anyone in charge here?

93
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,000
Is anyone here?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Where's the shopkeeper?

95
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,279
Come out right now!

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,160
Dear guests, dear guests!

97
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,000
W-what's going on here?

98
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,600
We were drinking just fine.

99
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,720
Why are you getting angry all of a sudden?

100
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,920
This Xiaoyao Spring isn't right.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,199
Did you water it down?

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,759
How is that possible?

103
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,480
Sir,

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,160
all our wine comes straight from the storeroom.

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
It's brought over directly.

106
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,240
There's no way it's fake.

107
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,319
It's not like we've never had Xiaoyao Spring before.

108
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,519
Do you take us for fools?

109
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,079
Exactly.

110
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
Yeah.

111
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,800
If you don't give us an explanation for this,

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,279
we'll smash up your Wangjiang Pavilion today.

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,920
That's right, we'll smash up your Wangjiang Pavilion.

114
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,600
No, it hasn't been watered down.

115
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,639
You must give us an explanation.

116
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,240
No.

117
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,079
It doesn't taste like this at all.

118
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,079
It must have been watered down.

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,319
How could this happen?

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
It's fake.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,920
The whole storeroom of wine has been watered down.

122
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
The Han family is going to take a big loss this time.

123
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,079
Young Master Xiao, Young Master Xiao!

124
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,560
Young Master Xiao!

125
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,920
Something's wrong, there's trouble!

126
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,079
The guests downstairs are making a scene.

127
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,319
You'd better go take a look.

128
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,600
I'm only responsible for supplying the wine.

129
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,279
I don't handle anything else.

130
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,800
That's not your...

131
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,199
Go on, go on.

132
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,360
Hurry and tell Miss Han.

133
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,759
Master

134
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,839
Master, Second Madam

135
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,879
Something bad has happened.

136
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,120
Speak.

137
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,199
The matter of Wangjiang Restaurant diluting Xiaoyao Spring with water

138
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,319
has been discovered by the guests.

139
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,120
What?

140
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,720
Wangjiang Restaurant also has fake wine now.

141
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,800
Not a single Han family restaurant has been spared.

142
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,279
The Xiaoyao Spring served today

143
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,800
was all stock from Wangjiang Restaurant.

144
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,160
Could it be that Xiao Ning did this on purpose?

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,279
Xiao Ning is well-versed in the ways of business.

146
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,560
He personally blended this Xiaoyao Spring wine.

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
He couldn't possibly do something like

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,439
ruin his own reputation.

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Master, it seems this wasn't done by Xiao Ning.

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,399
What else do you know?

151
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,360
Speak quickly.

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Today I heard from the staff

153
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,560
that Madam Su seemed to have gone to the storeroom.

154
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,879
She said

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
she wanted to mix thirty percent well water into the wine.

156
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,399
Sun Hongyan.

157
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,040
It must be that Xiaoyao Spring is too popular,

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,279
so she came up with this dirty trick.

159
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,279
She wanted to gain even more profit.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,199
How could she meddle with the wine of my Wangjiang Tower?

161
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,279
Yes.

162
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,480
Young Master gave the profits of Wangjiang Tower

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,959
to the Su family.

164
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
So she is also an owner of Wangjiang Tower.

165
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,759
What nonsense!

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,920
The Su family was meant to be used against Xiao Ning.

167
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,279
What exactly did that unfilial son say to the Su family?

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,600
Where is he?

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,399
Young Master.

170
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
Young Master went to the Su family.

171
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,639
Could it be that he really wants to

172
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,319
marry that Su Xueyan and bring her into the household?

173
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,600
Tell him to get back here immediately!

174
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,839
Master, please don't be angry.

175
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
The most urgent matter

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,879
is still to resolve the issue of the fake wine.

177
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,079
Luo'er, I'll have to trouble you with this matter.

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,639
Go.

179
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,319
Find Hongzhi.

180
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,040
Tell him to go to Wangjiang Tower at once.

181
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,240
He should learn the ways of business properly.

182
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Yes.

183
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,279
Tell us how you're going to handle this.

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
Give us an explanation.

185
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
I understand.

186
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,120
This Xiaoyao Spring was highly recommended by Xiao Ning.

187
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
He must be behind this.

188
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,279
Where is Xiao Ning?

189
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,680
Xiao Ning!

190
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,839
Come out here right now!

191
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,160
Xiao Ning, get out here!

192
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
Xiao Ning! Xiao Ning!

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:31,959
Xiao—

194
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,960
What are you doing?

195
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
That's Xiao Ning.

196
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,879
You won't even let people sleep.

197
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,080
Xiao Ning.

198
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,360
Xiaoyao Spring costs ten taels of silver per jug,

199
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,679
and you dare to dilute it with water to sell?

200
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,600
Are you that obsessed with money?

201
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,360
Exactly!

202
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,279
Selling fake wine to fool people—

203
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,519
I, Xiao, truly look down on such things.

204
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,600
If you want a refund, talk to the owner here.

205
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,799
What does this have to do with me?

206
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,120
You—

207
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,039
If there's any problem, let me handle it.

208
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,120
Greetings, Miss Han.

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,519
This matter is indeed the fault of the Han family.

210
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,080
I will immediately refund everyone's money for the wine.

211
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,720
Here.

212
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,080
How much?

213
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,519
One jug.

214
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,000
That's great.

215
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,759
Here you go.

216
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,559
Two jugs.

217
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,080
Alright.

218
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,039
Thank you.

219
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,879
This is yours.

220
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,799
Thank you, Miss Han.

221
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,720
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,600
Here you go.

223
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,120
Thanks.

224
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,000
Two jugs.

225
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,480
Alright.

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,840
Here.

227
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Here.

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
Thank you, Miss Han.

229
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,799
Thank you.

230
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,799
Thank you, Miss Han.

231
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,039
Let's go.

232
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,799
Thank you, Miss Han.

233
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,879
It's still Miss Han.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,759
Otherwise, we'd lose another ten taels of silver.

235
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,000
Miss Han...

236
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,639
Th-this...

237
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,039
About the fake wine incident,

238
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,600
That was done by Xiao Ning.

239
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,720
He should take full responsibility for this.

240
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,720
Young Master Xiao, do you have anything to say?

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,960
If I say I did it,

242
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,679
would you believe me?
