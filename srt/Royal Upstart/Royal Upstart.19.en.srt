1
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,799
This wine should only exist in heaven.

2
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,000
I

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,560
am momentarily at a loss for words.

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Excellent wine.

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,719
Pour it.

6
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,400
Then I won't disturb Your Majesty's enjoyment of the wine.

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,239
I take my leave.

8
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,239
Summon Yun'er to see me.

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,319
I want to reward her properly.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,640
Your Majesty,

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,920
the princess has not entered the palace today.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,640
Speaking of which,

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,079
Yun'er hasn't returned to the palace for several days.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,439
Could it be that she's with Xiao Ning...

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,280
No, that won't do.

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,079
This...

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,760
Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang!

18
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
I've been wanting to see you but couldn't find you.

19
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,159
I thought you liked Xiaoyao Spring the most.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,480
We're offering it at a 70% discount now.

21
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,200
No, no.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,079
Now that there are Yuxian and Minggong,

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,799
who still drinks Xiaoyao Spring?

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,799
Young Master Yang,

25
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,920
our Xiaoyao Spring tastes just as good.

26
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,599
And it's even cheaper.

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,879
Cheaper? Not really.

28
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,000
Now, Yuxian and Minggong,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,079
a bottle only costs five taels of silver.

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,239
Compared to your discounted Xiaoyao Spring,

31
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,759
it's not much more expensive.

32
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,879
Don't you think so?

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Young Master Yang,

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,599
No, no.

35
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,319
I knew Ning was lying to me.

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,960
So much for being friends and partners.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
Could such a perfect peach blossom fortune be fake?

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,360
I didn't expect him and the owner of Yuxian Restaurant, Jiang,

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
to have such a wonderful connection.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,919
Very good, very good.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,199
In-law.

42
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,120
In-law.

43
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,120
Are you calling me?

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,759
Our Ning and your family

45
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,080
have nothing to do with each other anymore.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,319
I'm not your in-law.

47
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,639
You can't say that.

48
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800
Even one day as a couple means a hundred days of kindness.

49
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,759
Xiao Ning was in our family

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,280
as our son-in-law for so long.

51
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,479
In-law, you must help us today.

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,039
Why are you looking for me?

53
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,120
We... we want to ask Xiao Ning

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,479
to authorize our Su family

55
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,879
to sell Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

56
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,159
Your Su family is ungrateful.

57
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,000
And now you come to ask us for help.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,159
How can you say that?

59
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,360
When Xiao Ning was with us before,

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,439
we treated him well with good food and drink.

61
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,039
He was the one who broke off the engagement.

62
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,280
He ran away from the Su residence.

63
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,599
How can you blame us for that?

64
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
If it weren't for your daughter

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,879
and that...

66
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,919
Han... Han Hongzhi, being so unclear with him,

67
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,719
our Ning wouldn't have ended up like this.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,159
What do you mean by "unclear"?

69
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,159
Don't listen to those rumors outside.

70
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,439
But I heard

71
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,840
when Xiao Ning was running the tea house,

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,080
he and the lady owner of Yuxian Restaurant

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
were the ones who were really unclear.

74
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
Who's spreading rumors about Jiang Yun?

75
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,080
And who are you?

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,319
I'm talking about that little vixen Jiang Yun.

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
What does it have to do with you?

78
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,560
How dare you!

79
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,840
How dare you insult my Yun'er's reputation!

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,599
Guards!

81
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,719
What are you trying to do?

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,319
Master, today we're traveling in disguise.

83
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,280
If you need to punish the Su family,

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,759
I can go contact the Imperial Guards right away.

85
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,280
Forget it.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,279
It's not the right time to make a big scene.

87
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,279
He's Jiang Yun's father.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199
Daoist Qianli is truly effective.

89
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,319
Mind your own business.

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
I am Xiao Hetai.

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Xiao Ning is my son.

92
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,720
You are Xiao Ning's father.

93
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,279
Yes, Brother Jiang.

94
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,879
Brother.

95
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,839
Brother Jiang.

96
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,759
We don't need to argue with such a rude person.

97
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,160
Please, have a seat inside.

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,399
I have much to discuss with Brother Jiang.

99
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,360
Come, please, please.

100
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,439
No need to be so polite.

101
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,560
Let me buy you a drink.

102
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,600
Come, come.

103
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,879
Who wants to argue with you anyway?

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,720
Honestly.

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,480
Don't bother with such a rude person.

106
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm so angry, so angry!

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,120
That's enough, Mother.

108
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,519
Yan'er.

109
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,759
Don't be upset.

110
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,639
Please.

111
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,480
I'm looking for your boss.

112
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,120
Is he in the shop?

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,279
Those wanting to meet our boss

114
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,600
are scheduled more than seven days out.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,279
Who are you?

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,040
We came here especially to visit.

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,680
We're here to discuss the wine business with Young Master Xiao.

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,279
I knew you would come.

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,040
It was worth waiting so long.

120
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,519
So it's Boss Huang and Boss Lin.

121
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,720
Greetings, greetings.

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,879
If it were anyone else,

123
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,560
they definitely wouldn't get to see our boss.

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,680
Well...

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,040
But please, both of you, come inside.

126
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,720
Thank you, thank you for your trouble.

127
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,319
Please.

128
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,560
Thank you.

129
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,439
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,480
Please, you two.

131
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:00,879
Please.

132
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,199
Greetings, Young Master Xiao.

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
If you have something to say, please get to the point.

134
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,560
I still need to confirm the sales channels for Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

135
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,560
Through which channels should they be sold?

136
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,959
Young Master Xiao,

137
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,040
The Lin family and I are the top two imperial merchants in Dajing.

138
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,839
We have many sales channels at our disposal.

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,120
If you entrust these two new wines to us,

140
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
and let us handle the sales,

141
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
you will definitely make a huge profit.

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
That's right.

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Entrust them to you?

144
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,439
Last time at Wangjiang Tower,

145
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,800
weren't you unwilling?

146
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
Please forgive us, Young Master Xiao.

147
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Last time, we truly didn't know that what you were selling

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,240
was Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

149
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,920
Yes, that's right.

150
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,839
At that time, the Su family was also interfering.

151
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,279
We really didn't know the inside story.

152
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,680
We were deceived.

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Yes, exactly.

154
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,040
That puts me in a difficult position.

155
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,279
I've already arranged most of the sales channels.

156
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,519
If you two join in now,

157
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
how am I supposed to explain it to the others?

158
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,879
It was indeed our fault last time.

159
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,360
Yes.

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,839
We're willing to give up twenty percent of the profits

161
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,439
to apologize to Young Master Xiao.

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,160
Twenty percent?

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,399
Why does this calculation not make sense to me?

164
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,240
Forty percent

165
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,839
We are absolutely sincere.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,279
Whatever Young Master Xiao wants us to sell in the future,

167
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,560
we will sell it.

168
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,399
We will never doubt Young Master Xiao again.

169
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,199
That's right.

170
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,399
With such sincerity,

171
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,279
then I'll consider it again.

172
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,839
Then let me

173
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,199
explain in detail

174
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,720
the business layout of the Huang and Lin families.

175
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,319
Yes, yes, yes.

176
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,800
Alright.

177
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,560
Very good.

178
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,639
Come, Brother Jiang.

179
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,720
So, our Ning'er

180
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,199
not only does great business,

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,319
but is also considerate and filial.

182
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,879
As for our family house,

183
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,240
it was originally taken back by the clan leader.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,560
He was worried that I, an old man, would have nowhere to live.

185
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,519
So he spent ten thousand taels of silver to buy it back for me.

186
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,920
What's ten thousand taels, anyway?

187
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,680
The money my Yun'er earns in various fields

188
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,440
could rival the Ministry of Revenue.

189
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,399
Jiang Yun's business

190
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,840
is all supported by our Ning'er behind the scenes.

191
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
So I say,

192
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,840
these two kids

193
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,799
are a perfect match made in heaven.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,399
Don't you think so?

195
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,440
Yes, yes, that's right.

196
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Uncle Xiao,

197
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,600
you've had quite a bit to drink today.

198
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,440
How about we...

199
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Not much at all.

200
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,240
Jiang and I hit it off right away.

201
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,399
Just keep pouring the wine.

202
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,120
Qingfeng, pour the wine.

203
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,480
Fill it up.

204
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,879
Yes, sir.

205
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,360
Brother Jiang,

206
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,559
Jiang Yun and Ning'er are a perfect match.

207
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,279
Why don't we exchange their birth dates?

208
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,320
Let's pick a date and set the wedding.

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,679
Engagement?

210
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,000
No.

211
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,240
No.

212
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,080
Why not?

213
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,039
Even Miss Qingfeng knows

214
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,480
that the two of them are interested in each other.

215
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,000
Qingfeng, do you know about this?

216
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,240
Qingfeng doesn't know.

217
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,279
Qingfeng doesn't know.

218
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,960
Brother Jiang,

219
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
I know a place

220
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
that's perfect to visit after drinking.

221
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,600
I guarantee you've never seen it.

222
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,879
I can't believe there's still

223
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,639
a place in Dajing I haven't seen.

224
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,320
Let's go.

225
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,559
My lord,

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,399
let's go.

227
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,360
Watch your step.

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,039
Let's go.

229
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,639
Be careful.

230
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,720
Uncle Xiao,

231
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,159
let's go.

232
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,679
Slow down.

233
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,240
Then I'll hold on.

234
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,440
Hang in there.
