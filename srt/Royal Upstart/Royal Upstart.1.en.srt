1
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,079
Be careful with that.

2
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,079
I spent a lot of money on this.

3
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,439
No wonder people say that young master is

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,960
the biggest spendthrift in Shangdu.

5
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,399
Spending so much money just to buy leaves.

6
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,280
And even stir-frying them.

7
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,399
You don't know anything.

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,039
Once my product is released,

9
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,560
you'll understand who I really am.

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,680
Actually, I'm the top genius in Shangdu.

11
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,959
As a dignified transmigrator,

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,200
I actually ended up in the body of

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,079
a prodigal who squandered his family's fortune.

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,760
And I even became

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,120
some nobody who appeared out of nowhere,

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,439
the live-in son-in-law of the Dajing Dynasty.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,079
But I will prove to the world

18
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,280
that the current Xiao Ning

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,760
is no longer a good-for-nothing wastrel,

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,760
but is about to become the richest son-in-law.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,799
So shameless.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,359
You're a grown man,

23
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,760
yet you married into a woman's family.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,359
And you’re not ashamed, but proud of it?

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,319
Look carefully,

26
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,560
Su Xueyan and I are engaged.

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
We are a legally married couple.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Get out of here.

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,439
Who would believe that?

30
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,599
Open the door.

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,680
It's me, Xiao Ning.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,319
The door actually opened.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,439
Are they really letting him in?

34
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,120
Yeah.

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,439
He’s acting all smug.

36
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,680
So what if he goes in?

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,159
Exactly.

38
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,640
Yeah.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Look, the Su family didn’t even put up any decorations.

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,319
There’s not even a single wedding character.

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,959
Exactly.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,120
So everyone is here to welcome me.

43
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,800
May I ask which one of you is my wife?

44
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,479
As expected, he really is a

45
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,479
good-for-nothing who can't show his face in public.

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
With how shabby you look,

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,719
you still want to marry into the Su family?

48
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,800
Letting you in today

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,879
is just to inform you

50
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,719
that your marriage with my daughter Xueyan

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,599
is an old matter from the past.

52
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,879
It doesn't count anymore.

53
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,879
So now you're denying it?

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,960
Fine.

55
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,120
I don't really want to anyway.

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,680
To marry into your Su family.

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,840
Then just break off the engagement with my father.

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm leaving.

59
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,560
Stop right there.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,400
My Su family is one of the three great imperial merchants.

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,360
This engagement cannot be broken off by the Su family.

62
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,919
I want you, in front of everyone in Shangdu,

63
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,960
to admit that it was you

64
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,639
who is not worthy of our Xueyan.

65
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,879
So you must beg our Su family to break off the engagement.

66
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Back then, the engagement

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,199
was your Su family

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
who begged my father to agree to it.

69
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,159
Now you regret it,

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,000
and want me to take the blame.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,680
Is this how your Su family does things?

72
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,080
What a sharp tongue you have.

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,319
These ten thousand taels

74
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,479
are to repay your father

75
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,039
for the money he lent the Su family back then.

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,719
From now on, you and Xueyan have nothing to do with each other.

77
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,039
And who are you?

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,639
Me?

79
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,360
This is Young Master Wei from the Ministry of Revenue's Vice Minister's family.

80
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,639
He is truly a match for our Xueyan.

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,879
Mother.

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,719
Aren't you ashamed yet?

83
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,840
It's all your fault for finding me such a crude person.

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,120
You've made me the laughingstock of all Shangdu.

85
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Xueyan

86
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,199
Look at you

87
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,719
Still so snobbish

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
Xueyan's beauty

89
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,960
is not something you can defile

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm looking at my wife

91
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,039
Who are others to gossip about her?

92
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,560
Your wife?

93
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Young Master Wei

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,039
About this matter

95
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,960
Leave it to me

96
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,439
The kitchen

97
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,560
A useless person like you

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
is only fit to live in the servants' quarters

99
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,720
Let's go

100
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,199
Ning'er

101
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,079
Your father is useless

102
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,800
I can only rely on your status as a son-in-law to the royal merchant

103
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,759
to ensure that the two of us

104
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,519
aren't kicked out of the Xiao family by the clan leader

105
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,279
If it weren't for your old father

106
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,600
would I still be suffering in the Su family?

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,560
Give me another five hundred taels

108
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,720
In three days

109
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,720
the tea house will officially open

110
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,439
Master

111
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,120
You can't keep spoiling the young master

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
The Xiao family has already been ruined by him

113
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
There's almost nothing left

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,319
It was the previous head who ruined it

115
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,279
Not me

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
The head of this cane is made of gold

117
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,319
Take it

118
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,079
In reality, as an orphan,

119
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,079
I have never felt such warm fatherly love.

120
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,680
Since I have taken over his son's body,

121
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,839
from now on, I must never

122
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,920
let him worry about me again.

123
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,199
Here.

124
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
The Xiao family that I ruined,

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,439
I will rebuild it with my own hands.

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Alright.

127
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,920
The new product is ready.

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,040
It will sell big tomorrow.

129
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,800
Don't miss out as you pass by!

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Nong Cha Pavilion is launching a new product today.

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,879
Exclusive flavor.

132
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,959
Free samples.

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,839
Offer ends soon.

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,879
Free samples!

135
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,399
There's also free tea.

136
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,079
Shopkeeper,

137
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,560
what is this drink called?

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,759
Why have I never seen it before?

139
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,279
This is milk tea I developed myself.

140
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,360
It has a smooth texture and rich flavor.

141
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,199
It's definitely a taste you've never had before.

142
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Are you saying all of these are free to try?

143
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,240
Of course.

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,439
I keep my word.

145
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,360
I can feel the spring breeze.

146
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,399
My tongue

147
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,959
Every inch of my skin

148
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,439
can feel the freshness of spring.

149
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,879
Don't fight, don't fight.

150
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,279
Today is just a tasting.

151
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,000
After the official opening,

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,839
everyone will get some.

153
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,199
What shop is downstairs?

154
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,759
Why are so many people gathered there?

155
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,879
Your Highness,

156
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:41,720
the one across the street is

157
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,199
Stupid.

158
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
You still can't change how you address me, can you?

159
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,839
Yes, Miss.

160
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,759
Everyone, don't forget

161
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,639
that the tea house officially opens tomorrow.

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,639
I want some too.

163
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,959
Me too.

164
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,680
What is this?

165
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,279
It's surprisingly delicious.

166
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,399
Mother

167
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,959
This is from a place among the common folk,

168
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,480
a teahouse called Nong Cha Pavilion.

169
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,199
They've just launched a new Four Seasons Milk Tea.

170
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,319
I think this Autumn Embrace flavor

171
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,680
is something you would definitely like.

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,839
The name is a bit strange,

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
but it really tastes sweet and fragrant.

174
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,720
The milk is rich and creamy.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,240
There's a slight bitterness beneath the sweetness.

176
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,120
The owner of this Nong Cha Pavilion

177
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,600
is quite a business talent.

178
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,519
This owner

179
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,839
will definitely be won over by me.

180
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,839
Second cup is half price.

181
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,240
That means,

182
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,920
if you buy two at once,

183
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,319
the second cup is only fifty coins.

184
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,040
Fifty?

185
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,079
I want it, I want it!

186
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,160
Today I'm going to try every flavor of Four Seasons Milk Tea!

187
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't push, don't push, there's enough for everyone!

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
Give me a cup!

189
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,920
Our Chen family wants a hundred servings!

190
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,839
Don't fight with me for it!

191
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
There's plenty for everyone!

192
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,759
Save some for the girls at Baihua Courtyard!

193
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,000
Give me ten cups!

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,319
Here you go.

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,399
Don't rush.

196
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:54,959
There's enough.

197
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,800
Two cups, two cups.

198
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,040
Here, for you.

199
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,079
Young Master Xiao

200
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,399
My lady invites you.

201
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,879
Who is your lady?

202
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,439
You'll know as soon as you see her.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,759
Please.

204
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,959
Young Master Xiao

205
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,000
Please have a seat.

206
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,920
This private room in Yuxian Pavilion

207
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,000
isn't usually open to outsiders, is it?

208
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,399
My lady

209
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,240
is the owner of Yuxian Pavilion.

210
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,759
So you're a wealthy lady.

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,360
May I ask why you invited me here,

212
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,600
beautiful lady?

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,879
I heard that this Four Seasons Milk Tea

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,279
is your creation, Young Master Xiao.

215
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,639
On the very first day you opened,

216
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,960
you attracted all of my Yuxian Pavilion's customers

217
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,519
over to your place.

218
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,799
Young Master Xiao,

219
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,879
your methods are impressive.

220
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,639
So you think I'm stealing your business

221
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,120
and came here to cause trouble?

222
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,120
That's not true.

223
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,960
I run my tea house honestly and openly.

224
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,200
You may control everything else,

225
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,919
but can you control what people choose to drink?

226
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,840
How dare you speak to my

227
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
lady like that!

228
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,559
I know

229
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,639
your Yuxian Pavilion is powerful and wealthy,

230
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,399
but I still have

231
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,399
over a hundred business tricks I haven't used yet.

232
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,320
Be careful,

233
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,559
or I could bankrupt you at any time.

234
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,279
I'm leaving.

235
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,840
Young Master Xiao, you've misunderstood.

236
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,399
I'm not here to compete with you.

237
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:21,559
I'm not here to compete with you.

238
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,759
On the contrary,

239
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,799
I want to buy your tea house.

240
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Not for sale.

241
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,960
Right now, Father

242
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,399
it's already so hard to come up with five hundred taels.

243
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,080
If we had this amount of capital to work with,

244
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,120
the Tea Pavilion could expand rapidly.

245
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,440
Proposing to buy it outright so rashly

246
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,799
is indeed inappropriate.

247
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,840
If this puts you in a difficult position, Young Master Xiao,

248
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,039
I have another idea.

249
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,679
I can provide the money.

250
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,200
It could help the Tea Pavilion's future development.

251
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
I would take seventy percent of the annual profits.

252
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,519
What do you think, Young Master Xiao?

253
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,559
This method could work.

254
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,000
But seventy percent is too much.

255
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,960
Thirty percent at most.

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,960
Young Master Xiao, you must be joking.

257
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,559
This amount of money is enough to buy

258
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,799
ten Tea Pavilions.

259
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
You're talking about now.

260
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,440
A month from now, the Tea Pavilion

261
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,879
will be priceless.

262
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
Seventy percent, then.

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,799
Thirty percent.

264
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,039
Sixty percent.

265
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,799
Sixty percent won't work either.

266
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:17,480
Thirty percent.

267
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,200
Sixty percent.

268
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,399
This is all real money.

269
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,039
My Tea Pavilion is always packed with customers.

270
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,960
That's not fake, either.

271
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,360
Would my Jade Virtue House ever deceive you?

272
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,559
As expected.

273
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,320
Once Your Highness talks business, you forget all decorum.

274
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,759
Even sixty percent is overestimating its value.

275
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,679
Thirty percent.

276
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,639
You haven't even tasted it, how would you know?

277
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,879
At thirty percent, I barely make any profit.

278
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,320
Qingfeng, bring me some water.

279
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,120
I refuse to believe I can't handle him.

280
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,440
Yes.

281
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,320
Talking business like this

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,960
is such a waste of time.

283
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,440
Drink.

284
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,600
Fifty percent.

285
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,879
Even fifty percent won't work.

286
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Thirty percent.

287
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,080
I won't budge.

288
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,159
I'll add one more condition.

289
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,480
If you run into any trouble with your business in the future,

290
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,440
just mention my name, Jiang Yun.

291
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,559
No one in the whole city will dare to mess with you.

292
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Are you saying

293
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,960
you have connections above?

294
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,919
Of course.

295
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,480
If it's second rank or above, I'll agree.

296
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,159
I guarantee second rank or above.

297
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,039
Deal.

298
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,919
Young Master Xiao,

299
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,320
we are just business partners.

300
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,519
Don't get handsy.

301
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,799
Be careful or I'll cut off your hand.

302
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
This is

303
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,440
a businessman's etiquette.
