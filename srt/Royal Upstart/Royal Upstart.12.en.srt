1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
Then I must give it a try.

2
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,280
What exactly does this Xiaoyao Spring taste like?

3
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,319
Such a rich aroma.

4
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,040
The wine goes down sweetly.

5
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,680
Rich aroma, sweet on the palate.

6
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,079
The wine reaches deep inside.

7
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,840
It stirs the soul.

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,640
Calling it nectar of the gods is no exaggeration.

9
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
What’s especially precious is

10
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,280
this wine has a full-bodied taste.

11
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,439
Like ten thousand horses galloping.

12
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,280
It’s truly addictive.

13
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,439
I want to drink too.

14
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,120
Let me have a taste as well.

15
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,319
Pour wine for all the gentlemen.

16
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,120
Fill everyone’s cup.

17
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,120
Yes.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,280
Hurry, pour me some!

19
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,159
Let me remind everyone,

20
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,000
the strength of this Xiaoyao Spring

21
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,439
is more than ten times that of Jinjiang wine.

22
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,039
The wine is good, but don’t overindulge.

23
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,520
It truly is fine wine.

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,120
Wonderful.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,560
Never in Dajing

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,159
have I tasted such fine wine.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,479
Yingyang has Tu Jiao Chun.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,479
Guiping has Shixi.

29
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,120
Yingzhou has Fushui.

30
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,199
Wucheng has Ruoxia.

31
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,840
There’s also imported Sanle wine from Persia.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,879
And Malang wine imported from Dashi.

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,759
But here in Shangdu,

34
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,400
nothing compares to Xiaoyao Spring.

35
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,639
Excellent, excellent!

36
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,800
Xiaoyao Spring!

37
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,360
Cheers!

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,199
Sir,

39
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,560
this wine is strong, you can’t drink it like that.

40
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,560
Why haven't you eaten any of the snacks with your wine?

41
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,639
My good brother,

42
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,599
not only are you skilled in poetry,

43
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,960
but your wine and tea skills are also exceptional.

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
As for me, an old man like myself...

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,599
Boss, boss!

46
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,280
Give me a hand, give me a hand!

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,680
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

48
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,199
Quick!

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,560
Faster, faster, faster!

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,080
Help me out!

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Brother, are you engaged?

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,000
I have a granddaughter who is still unmarried.

53
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,639
Hurry, hurry!

54
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,280
She is skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

55
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,759
Especially in needlework.

56
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,240
She's truly impressive.

57
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,280
Young Master Xiao,

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,719
please slow down.

59
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,039
Young Master Xiao,

60
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,400
take it easy.

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,560
My Sun family winery would like to purchase five hundred jars of Xiaoyao Spring.

62
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,439
Alright, alright, alright.

63
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm really sorry,

64
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,759
I'm only responsible for delivering this Xiaoyao Spring

65
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,159
to the Han family's various restaurants.

66
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
If you want to purchase it,

67
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,800
you'll still need to talk to Miss Han.

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
So, we have to go to the Prime Minister's residence to discuss business?

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,919
Forget it, forget it, let's not talk about it.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,159
Let's just drink, let's drink!

71
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,319
It seems

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
that even someone as talented as Young Master Xiao

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,719
can't escape the cage of a noble family.

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
Slow down, slow down.

75
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,919
It looks like Young Master Xiao

76
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,840
is working for the Han family now.

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,319
I'm just here to make sure everyone gets a drink.

78
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Why do you care who works for whom?

79
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Right?

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,520
There's not much of the Xiaoyao Spring left today.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,399
If you haven't tried it yet, you'd better hurry.

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
Give me a cup, let me try it.

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,240
Hurry up, hurry up.

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,040
Try it quickly.

85
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,800
Pour me a drink too.

86
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,560
The business at Wangjiang Tower today

87
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,279
is twice as good as usual.

88
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,439
The profits from Wangjiang Tower

89
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,920
are even higher than I expected.

90
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,399
It's all gone, it's all gone.

91
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,360
Everyone, disperse, disperse.

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,879
Xiao Ning.

93
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,879
This is really good wine, really good.

94
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,680
Why are you here?

95
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,639
You all ruined the tea pavilion.

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
So I mixed some wine myself to sell.

97
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,680
I was wondering.

98
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,199
This Young Master Xiao

99
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,040
isn't he Miss Su's husband?

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,319
Yeah.

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,600
Why is he selling wine at Wangjiang Tower?

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
What husband?

103
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,720
Our Su family divorced Xiao Ning long ago.

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Look at him now.

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,120
He was never someone respectable to begin with.

106
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,319
Now he's just a servant.

107
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,040
That suits his character even more.

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,759
It's good they separated.

109
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
Xueyan

110
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,439
No need to waste words on a mere servant selling goods like him.

111
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,480
If it weren't for Yan Lingluo

112
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,639
begging me to sell her the wine,

113
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
I would have sold this Xiaoyao Spring to someone else long ago.

114
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,120
Xiao Ning

115
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,199
My mother only took you in

116
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,759
as a servant to sell goods, nothing more.

117
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,839
Stop trying to make yourself look important.

118
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
Xiao Ning

119
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,079
Our Xueyan

120
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,399
is about to marry Hongzhi.

121
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,959
Thirty percent of Wangjiang Tower's profits

122
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,439
already belong to our Su family.

123
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
From now on,

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
I'll be the owner of Wangjiang Tower as well.

125
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,759
You just focus on selling wine here for me.

126
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,319
If you do well,

127
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
who knows,

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,759
I might even give you a reward.

129
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,959
Han Hongzhi

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,199
You're really going all out just to take advantage of people.

131
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,759
You're spending a fortune on this.

132
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,680
Since you refuse to give the Su family

133
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,199
the tea house that rightfully belongs to us,

134
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,879
of course I can't let Xueyan's family

135
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,000
be wronged.

136
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,439
Mother-in-law, no need to talk to people like him.

137
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,199
Let me take you and Xueyan to see the private rooms.

138
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,319
I'll also introduce you to some distinguished guests.

139
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,079
The private rooms at Wangjiang Tower

140
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,639
are only for the most powerful people in Shangdu.

141
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,839
Thanks to our son-in-law,

142
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,600
our Su family finally has a chance to rise to greatness.

143
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,480
Please.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,639
Alright.

145
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,639
Xiao Ning

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,560
Really, it's like heaven and earth between you two.

147
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Xiao Ning

148
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,519
It's important to know your own limits.

149
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,600
Stop putting on a false front.

150
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,279
You'll just make yourself a laughingstock.

151
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,680
Go ahead and show off.

152
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,120
But don't call for help if things go wrong.

153
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,199
Your Majesty, the Prime Minister has arrived.

154
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,839
Your subject greets Your Majesty.

155
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,879
What brings you to the palace at this hour?

156
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,759
Your Majesty,

157
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,519
I am not here on state business today.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,639
My family's tavern has produced a fine new wine.

159
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,199
I have come to offer it for Your Majesty to taste.

160
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
Speaking of wine,

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,720
you've made me crave a drink.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,839
It smells rich and strong.

163
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,040
Just the aroma tells me it's good wine.

164
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,839
Your Majesty,

165
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,399
I was careless.

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,439
I should have tasted the wine first.

167
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
How could there be anything wrong with a gift from you?

168
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
You're too old-fashioned.

169
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,440
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

170
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,840
This wine is rich and fragrant,

171
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,879
but it has a fiery taste.

172
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,399
It's truly invigorating.

173
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm glad Your Majesty likes it.

174
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,159
As long as you like it.

175
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,360
Since you had such good wine,

176
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,919
why didn't you present it to me sooner?

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,799
Your Majesty,

178
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,440
this wine was made by my wife

179
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,720
with the help of Young Master Xiao Ning.

180
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,240
It was only recently released for sale.

181
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,720
Who?

182
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,960
It's that

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,519
Young Master Xiao Ning from the tea house.

184
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,279
So Xiao Ning has such skills as well.

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,159
What a pity, it's not good to drink too much at noon.

186
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,080
Your Majesty, this old minister won't disturb your meal.

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,519
I'll take my leave first.

188
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,480
You may go.

189
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,120
I take my leave.

190
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,360
Miss.

191
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,159
Miss.

192
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,919
Qingfeng.

193
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,200
It's dinner time tonight.

194
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,039
Why isn't there a single customer in the shop?

195
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,279
It's all Xiao Ning's fault.

196
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,639
Our Yuxian Restaurant might be going out of business.

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,559
Our business isn't doing well.

198
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,159
What does that have to do with Young Master Xiao?

199
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,159
Young Master Xiao has developed a new

200
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,679
wine called Xiaoyao Spring.

201
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,799
It has attracted all the customers

202
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,519
to Wangjiang Restaurant.

203
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,960
The new wine is ready.

204
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Then why don't you hurry and ask him for more?

205
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,440
Miss.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,639
Young Master Xiao said this Xiaoyao Spring

207
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,000
is only sold to the Han Family Restaurant.

208
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,159
He won't sell it to anyone else.

209
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,879
What?

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,639
Did you hear that wrong?

211
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,200
I wouldn't dare make things up.

212
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,840
This Young Master Xiao

213
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,639
has probably already sided with the Han family.

214
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, Xiao Ning,

215
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,879
how dare you betray me!

216
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,480
Let's go, Qingfeng.

217
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,480
Come with me to deal with him.

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,720
Wait a moment.

219
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,039
What's wrong, Miss?

220
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,720
You're not getting soft-hearted again, are you?

221
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm reminding you to bring your sword.

222
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,440
Yes.

223
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,679
Master

224
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:31,960
Luo'er

225
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,200
Today, I have already presented the Xiaoyao Spring to His Majesty.

226
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
How did His Majesty react?

227
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,720
He probably hates Xiao Ning to the core now.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,679
If Xiao Ning wants to survive from now on,

229
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,919
he can only cling tightly to our Han family.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,879
Luo'er, your skills are truly impressive.

231
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,000
The Han family's business will be entrusted to you.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,480
As for me,

233
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,360
I am completely at ease.

234
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,759
This is exactly the taste.

235
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,279
It's finally done.
