1
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,439
But the Imperial Academy

2
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,119
and the two main paths to officialdom through the imperial exams

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,079
are both controlled by the noble families.

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,799
Where else is there a way in?

5
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,920
Newspapers.

6
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,799
Newspapers are the new path.

7
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,079
Report what?

8
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,960
Newspapers.

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,320
What is a newspaper?

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,600
A newspaper is a kind of

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,479
document that contains books, brief news, and national policies,

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,920
as well as all kinds of information.

13
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,200
It can not only teach

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,519
people across the country to read and write,

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,159
but also make your ideas for governing the country

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,319
and information about recruiting talent known to all.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,280
In this way,

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,319
the tricks the noble families use to deceive superiors and hide the truth

19
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,599
will be useless.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,480
This is a good method.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,359
But without the path of the Imperial Academy exams,

22
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,920
those students from humble backgrounds

23
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,920
what other channels do they have

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,599
to showcase their talents?

25
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,040
Perhaps the newspaper.

26
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,920
But the poor have no publishing houses.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,159
How can they publish newspapers?

28
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,879
If they can't publish, we can collect their works.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
Whether it's poetry or strategies for governing the country,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,040
we can use the newspaper

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,159
to compile all of them together

32
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,879
and then submit them to Lord Zhang or to you

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,159
for personal review.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,319
Select the promising talents for focused cultivation.

35
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,239
Publishing newspapers throughout the entire country

36
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,640
is a major undertaking.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,400
It would require a huge amount of silver.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,400
As long as it can free the country from the control of noble families,

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,959
I'm willing to pay for it.

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,079
You will pay?

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,799
Yes.

42
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,599
My tea and wine business

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,919
has already earned ten million taels.

44
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm willing to invest all of it into this.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,759
This Xiao Ning is actually willing

46
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,879
to give up all his family fortune.

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,199
Could it be that he really is, as Yun'er said,

48
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,800
a man who cares for the world?

49
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,680
Xiao Ning

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,319
Once this newspaper is published,

51
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,560
every industry in Dajing

52
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,560
will have to set their business strategies according to it.

53
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,639
If you control the newspaper,

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,000
you control the foundation of commerce in Dajing.

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,039
Do you intend to replace the Han family

56
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,120
and become the most powerful clan in Dajing?

57
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,840
Your Majesty,

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,840
When poor, one should maintain personal integrity;

59
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,159
when successful, one should help the world.

60
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,159
This has always been

61
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,240
my guiding principle in life.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,840
I am willing to

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,639
donate ninety percent of all my business profits

64
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,439
to the national treasury

65
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,840
to benefit the people of Dajing.

66
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,520
Are you truly willing to do that?

67
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,719
However, I have one more request.

68
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,120
I hope Your Majesty will agree.

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,800
Speak.

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,479
I want to see Jiang Yun.

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,680
In your dreams.

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Then... then I'll take a step back.

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,719
Don't let Jiang Yun be sent for the marriage alliance.

74
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,919
The marriage alliance must be fulfilled after autumn.

75
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,080
If it is not fulfilled,

76
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,560
both Beicang and the noble families of Dajing

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
will use this as an excuse to cause trouble.

78
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,120
I ask Your Majesty to grant me three months.

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,919
Three months?

80
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,120
What can you accomplish in that time?

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
Within three months,

82
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,960
if I can shake the powerful clans,

83
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
cleanse the court and the government,

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,800
and ensure Da Jing gets through the autumn harvest smoothly,

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,599
then Bei Cang will no longer be a threat.

86
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,560
Xiao Ning.

87
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,120
Do you know what you're saying?

88
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,560
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

89
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,280
My plans have always been reliable.

90
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,319
Within three months,

91
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,400
Jiang Yun will no longer need to marry for alliance.

92
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,719
And I

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,960
will surely return to Your Majesty

94
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,519
a peaceful and prosperous Da Jing.

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Jiang Yun

96
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,160
Princess

97
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,720
Qingfeng has already given you the contract.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
Why are you still following me?

99
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,120
It's a misunderstanding.

100
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,480
You only told me you were going out.

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I thought you were just going on a trip.

102
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,839
Who knew you were going to get married?

103
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,959
Besides,

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,480
you're not just my business partner.

105
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,759
It's all the Han family's fault.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,879
If he hadn't tried to kill me and my father,

107
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,519
I wouldn't be in such a hurry.

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,399
Han family

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,759
You're hurt.

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Where are you hurt?

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,160
It's not me.

112
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,439
It's my father.

113
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,839
Uncle Xiao, he...

114
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,360
Why didn't you say so earlier?

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,759
Extra, extra!

116
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,639
Minghua Bookstore is publishing a newspaper.

117
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
There are not only free books,

118
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,800
but also public collections from famous people and heroes.

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
What's a newspaper?

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,720
It even has ways to make money,

121
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
and has caught His Majesty's personal attention.

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,879
Let's go check it out.

123
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,839
We'll know once we see it.

124
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,839
Have you all seen this?

125
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,240
There's everything on here.

126
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
You can read so many poems.

127
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,920
That's right.

128
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,959
These portraits are so lifelike.

129
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,399
Everyone,

130
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,920
Besides the daily publications of the Shangdu Daily,

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,199
and the free books it releases,

132
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,399
it also updates daily

133
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,240
with the most important news in the entire realm.

134
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,759
In addition,

135
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,279
in the outstanding personal columns,

136
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,680
it will also publish poems by talented individuals,

137
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,000
or their thoughts and reflections,

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,560
or some articles they've written themselves.

139
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,279
In short, everyone is encouraged to submit their work.

140
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,399
Young Master Xiao, are you saying

141
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,199
that we can have our own articles

142
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,480
published in this newspaper?

143
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,040
Exactly.

144
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,199
Your articles

145
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,279
will be seen directly by the Censorate and the Ministry of Personnel,

146
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,959
and even by His Majesty.

147
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,120
How is that possible?

148
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,279
Who do you think you are?

149
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,120
You think you can command so many high officials?

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
Yeah, how could that be possible?

151
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,079
Come.

152
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,000
Censorate official.

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,720
The Censorate official has come in person.

154
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,360
Even the Censorate official is here.

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,879
Everyone,

156
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,879
the Shangdu Daily was established

157
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,720
by imperial decree from His Majesty.

158
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,519
I now announce

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,279
that Master Chen is also the

160
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,160
chief editor of the Shangdu Daily.

161
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,199
Master Chen is the chief editor?

162
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,920
And it was personally decreed by His Majesty.

163
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,720
Really, really.

164
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,560
This is an imperial decree.

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
This is real now.

166
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:35,920
It's real.

167
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,439
It's true.

168
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,240
With the imperial decree and Master Chen's personal confirmation,

169
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,360
this must be real.

170
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,879
We students from humble backgrounds finally have a chance

171
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,879
to personally show our talents to His Majesty.

172
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,800
Yes.

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,079
On behalf of all students from humble families,

174
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,000
I thank Young Master Xiao for your great kindness.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,839
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

176
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,639
No, no, please.

177
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,560
It is His Majesty who,

178
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,000
has opened the door of opportunity for all humble families.

179
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
I only did a small thing.

180
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,680
Thank His Majesty for his great kindness.

181
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
Let me first bring you

182
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
the impact of traditional media.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Alright, alright.

184
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,399
I have another piece of good news to share with you all.

185
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,079
More good news?

186
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,160
What else is there?

187
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,240
Hurry, tell us!

188
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
The poems and songs you all write,

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
even storybooks,

190
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,680
as long as they are selected for the Shangdu Daily,

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,480
you will receive a reward as thanks.

192
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
A reward?

193
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,600
We can even get paid?

194
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,639
Not only will it help us gain fame,

195
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,040
but they'll also pay us?

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
Exactly.

197
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,600
That's wonderful!

198
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
I'll go back right away

199
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,440
and bring my own articles

200
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,679
to submit for selection.

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,639
Mother,

202
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,399
I'm going to be in the newspaper!

203
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,279
I want to write too!

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
When I get home, I'll have my young master write as well.

205
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,799
Yes!

206
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,120
This way, we'll all have a chance in the future.

207
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,440
Hong'er

208
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,559
Some time ago

209
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,679
that newspaper founded by Xiao Ning

210
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,639
has it made any money?

211
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
Father, to answer your question

212
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,240
Xiao Ning's newspaper business

213
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,639
has been running for over two months

214
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
not only has it made no profit

215
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,679
but it's also lost quite a bit

216
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
I'm afraid the money from the tea and wine businesses

217
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,879
that was earned

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
has all been invested in it

219
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,399
His Majesty and Xiao Ning

220
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,440
think they can use a few pieces of scrap paper

221
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,960
to bring down the great families of Dajing

222
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
what a joke

223
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,600
They all say Xiao Ning is a business genius

224
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,080
but it seems he's run out of tricks now

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,840
Master, have some tea

226
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,840
With this, His Majesty should understand

227
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,159
that the noble families are the foundation of Dajing

228
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
You

229
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,039
do you understand?

230
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,679
Lingluo understands

231
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,159
Although I don't know

232
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,440
what use this newspaper really has

233
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:06,960
but

234
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,320
it's time to lend Young Master Xiao a helping hand

235
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,759
Young Master Xiao

236
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,639
I haven't seen you these days, sister

237
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,600
did you miss me?

238
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,919
Miss Han, could it be that

239
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,559
you've taken an interest in my newspaper business again?

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,600
How do you plan to cooperate this time?

241
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,639
Your newspaper is probably targeting the noble families, isn't it?

242
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,639
I, Lingluo, wouldn't dare get involved.

243
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,960
Could it be that Yan Lingluo has figured something out?

244
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,519
It seems I guessed right.

245
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,039
But sir, you need not worry.

246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
This time, I've come

247
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,759
to lend you a helping hand.

248
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,039
Miss Han, what do you mean by this?

249
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,039
Sir, you don't need to call me Miss Han anymore.

250
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,799
You can consider me

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,840
a spy hidden within the Han family.

252
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,639
What?
