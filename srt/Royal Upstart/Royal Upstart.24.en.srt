1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,880
You don't need to call me Miss Han anymore.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,640
You can see me as

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,679
a spy hidden within the Han family.

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,640
What?

5
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,480
I was originally the legitimate daughter of the Yan merchant family from Jiangnan.

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,879
Han Wuguo wanted to seize my family's business.

7
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,760
He sent people to murder my father and elder brother.

8
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,359
He thought I didn't know.

9
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,120
He even valued my business skills.

10
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,480
He pretended to save me and took me into his household.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,920
All these years,

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I've worked desperately to manage business for the Han family.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,560
It was all to gain Han Wuguo's trust.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,079
Only then could I obtain

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,519
evidence of their collusion, corruption,

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,719
and crimes of greed and murder.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,599
You...

18
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,319
How could you give something so important

19
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,159
to me?

20
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,319
The Han family has deep roots.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,879
I'm afraid even if I risk everything,

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
I still couldn't shake them at all.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,359
But you're different.

24
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,239
You always do astonishing things.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,599
You're smarter than ordinary people.

26
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,480
I guess you spent so much money

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,640
to start a newspaper

28
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,800
just to deal with the powerful families.

29
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,240
Aren't you afraid you've trusted the wrong person?

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,599
I'm not afraid.

31
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,879
My confidence in you

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,159
is probably greater than my trust in myself.

33
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,360
Such national policies

34
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,439
are far superior to those of Grand Tutor Qian of the Imperial Academy

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
by several times.

36
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,400
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,919
these essays were all written by students from humble backgrounds

38
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,719
and submitted through the Shangdu Daily.

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,159
Xiao Ning's newspaper has achieved such remarkable results.

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,439
Summon those students from humble families.

41
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,080
I wish to meet them in person.

42
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,120
This...

43
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,319
If Your Majesty summons them at this time,

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,560
it may arouse the suspicion

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
and vigilance of the major noble families.

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,800
Young Master Xiao said that when the time is right,

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
he will bring all the talented scholars

48
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,400
before Your Majesty.

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,120
Still waiting for the right time?

50
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,319
The three-month deadline is almost up.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Minister, are you trying to help Xiao Ning delay things?

52
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,240
I would never dare to do so.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,360
Young Master Xiao has great foresight.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,280
Please trust him this once, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,280
Enough, you may withdraw for now.

56
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,280
Boss

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,159
Throughout the entire region

58
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,639
we've collected so much news and so many articles

59
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,000
when are we actually going to publish them?

60
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,680
Now, people running teahouses everywhere

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,959
are all working on newspapers

62
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,160
and not doing business anymore

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,839
If this goes on, we'll be bankrupt in a few days

64
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Wait for Lord Zhang

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,319
It should be today

66
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
Young Master Xiao, Young Master Xiao

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm here

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Lord Zhang, how did it go?

69
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,720
Young Master Xiao

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,160
His Majesty has already read all the submitted articles

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
He has gone through all of them

72
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,160
He couldn't stop praising them

73
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,199
The talented scholars from humble backgrounds on the list

74
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,439
finally have a chance to enter officialdom

75
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,959
That's wonderful

76
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,399
We've finally waited for this day

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,319
Tomorrow, I'll publish ten articles

78
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,600
I'll show you all

79
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,680
what it means to be unable to stop gossiping

80
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,240
Tell Xiao Ning

81
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,480
I trust him this time

82
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,600
Your Majesty is wise

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,319
Well caught.

84
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,120
Corrupt official.

85
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,800
Well caught.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,600
So many corrupt officials have been exposed lately.

87
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,959
They should be thrown into the death cell.

88
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,319
His Majesty is wise.

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,759
With the Shangdu Daily,

90
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,639
we common people

91
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,759
can finally see the true face of these noble families.

92
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,399
That's right.

93
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:37,839
These corrupt officials

94
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,279
deserve to be caught.

95
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,360
They'll be beheaded tomorrow.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,639
Just look at the things they've done.

97
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,399
Good.

98
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,519
Congratulations.

99
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,279
Congratulations.

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,120
Congratulations.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,279
Be a good official.

102
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,000
I say, you all saw it, right?

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,079
The article published in the Shangdu Daily,

104
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,839
can really be seen by His Majesty.

105
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,839
This is a great opportunity

106
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
for us students from humble backgrounds to enter officialdom.

107
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Young Master Han, be careful.

108
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Alright, alright.

109
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
You sure know how to talk.

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,199
Look.

111
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,279
That must be Young Master Han from the Prime Minister's residence.

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
That day, I

113
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,639
That day, I was passing by

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,199
and I saw him at the entrance.

115
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,680
Really?

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,839
I think you were there too.

117
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,480
Young master, you have returned.

118
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,839
Did you have an enjoyable night?

119
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
Every night is filled with music and beautiful company.

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,199
This is the life I deserve.

121
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,879
Young master.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Miss Hua Qianqian is free tomorrow night.

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,959
Will you go again?

124
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,360
Of course I will.

125
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
Qianqian not only composes poetry,

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
she also knows how to comfort and care for people.

127
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,319
Compared to that aloof Su Xueyan,

128
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,600
she is so much better.

129
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
Hongzhi.

130
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I really don't know

131
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,879
you actually see me this way.

132
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,000
Why are you here?

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
If I hadn't come,

134
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,120
I'm afraid I'd never see your true nature in this lifetime.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,480
It's another one of Xiao Ning's newspapers.

136
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,680
How did he know I went to the brothel?

137
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,480
Who leaked the information?

138
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,720
It definitely wasn't me, young master.

139
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,519
I didn't expect

140
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,480
the person I thought was as pure as the bright moon

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,519
would be so debauched and depraved.

142
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,360
From now on, I have nothing to do with you.

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,079
Su Xueyan,

144
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,199
if it weren't for dealing with Xiao Ning,

145
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,040
why would I ever be interested in the daughter of a third-rate merchant?

146
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,879
Now the Su family's business is nearly gone.

147
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
If you want the Su family to survive,

148
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,759
then obediently become my concubine.

149
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
Do you understand?

150
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,720
Dealing with Xiao Ning—

151
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,120
So from the very beginning, you only ever saw me

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,839
as a tool to be used.

153
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,879
Otherwise, what do you think you are?

154
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,600
If you obediently submit to me,

155
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,120
I can still let you keep some dignity.

156
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,160
Otherwise,

157
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
Even if I die, I will never submit to you.

158
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,480
Wretch!

159
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Seize her for me!

160
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,639
Remove the official positions of the noble families

161
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,759
Promote people from humble backgrounds into government

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,039
They even dare to slander the Han family’s reputation

163
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,759
This Xiao Ning is simply reckless and audacious

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,759
Father

165
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
Today’s Shangdu Daily

166
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,639
published ten issues in a single day

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,519
His Majesty and Xiao Ning

168
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,120
are trying to make all the people of Dajing

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,639
believe that the noble families are losing power

170
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,279
If this continues

171
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,559
our noble families will be completely eroded

172
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,320
and will never rise again

173
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,919
I still say the same thing

174
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,679
Dajing

175
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,080
still belongs to the noble families

176
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,279
It has been this way for hundreds of years

177
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,799
Even His Majesty

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,960
cannot stand above the noble families

179
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,759
Father

180
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,159
Go

181
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
and summon all the heads of the powerful noble families

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Bring them all to me

183
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,279
I want His Majesty

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,039
to bow to us

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,720
and submit

186
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,519
At such a late hour

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,639
What are you all doing here, sirs?

188
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,639
We have urgent matters to discuss with His Majesty

189
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,519
Prime Minister

190
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,000
His Majesty is already resting

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,919
Prime Minister

192
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,720
Your Majesty

193
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,559
Your Majesty

194
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,519
Your Majesty

195
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,879
Your Majesty

196
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,840
I, Han Wuguo, together with all court officials of second rank and above in Dajing

197
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,399
request an audience with Your Majesty

198
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,840
Minister Han, what is the meaning of this?

199
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,600
There was no memorial to present at the morning court.

200
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,440
Yet now you bring so many officials

201
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,000
to surround my imperial study.

202
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,679
Are you planning to rebel?

203
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,759
Your Majesty,

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,600
we have no intention of offending you.

205
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
We are merely concerned about the stability of our nation.

206
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,639
That is why we have taken the liberty to request an audience.

207
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,000
Han Wuguo,

208
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,600
explain this to me clearly.

209
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,960
Your Majesty,

210
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
Recently, public opinion in our country has been in turmoil.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,840
The Shangdu Daily, founded by Xiao Ning,

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
has been recklessly spreading news about court affairs and beyond.

213
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,120
This has caused widespread panic among the people.

214
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,159
And the matter of the marriage alliance with Beicang

215
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,720
has been delayed for several months.

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,159
If we do not send an envoy soon,

217
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,799
I fear war may break out.

218
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,519
Your Majesty,

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,320
In your opinion, what should be done?

220
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,360
Your Majesty,

221
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,320
I believe that, externally, the princess should

222
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
be sent to Beicang for a political marriage immediately,

223
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,519
to prevent the outbreak of war.

224
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,360
Internally, a department for commercial affairs should be established,

225
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,919
to oversee all major commercial activities.

226
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,960
This is to guard against cunning people like Xiao Ning,

227
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,720
who might undermine the foundations of our noble families,

228
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,639
and threaten the stability of our nation.

229
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,720
Furthermore,

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the Shangdu Daily

231
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,919
has been spreading false information through public opinion,

232
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,279
and should be banned.

233
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,080
I am aware of what you have reported, Minister Han.

234
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,279
I will make a decision after careful consideration.

235
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
Your Majesty,

236
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,039
Your Majesty,

237
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,000
The estates of our noble families are already in grave danger.

238
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,360
If we delay any longer,

239
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,399
we may not even be able to collect any taxes.

240
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,279
Your Majesty,

241
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Indeed, Your Majesty.

242
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,360
Beicang has had troops stationed for a long time.

243
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,960
If we do not make a decision soon,

244
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,360
we may regret it when it is too late.

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
Are you all trying to force me?

246
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,840
Your Majesty,

247
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,960
All our actions are for the sake of our nation.

248
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,840
We hope Your Majesty will see this clearly.

249
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,120
Please see this clearly, Your Majesty.

250
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,840
Your Majesty need not worry.

251
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,000
I have solutions

252
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,879
for everything.

253
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,120
Father Emperor.

254
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

255
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,840
Xiao Ning.
