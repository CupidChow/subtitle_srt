1
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,439
Let go of me.

2
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,280
Let go.

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,679
Let go of me.

4
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,479
Han Hongzhi.

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,359
No matter what, she's still your concubine.

6
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,119
How could you do something so beastly?

7
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,799
Why are you pretending to be so pure and innocent with me?

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,640
Do you really think you could ever catch my eye?

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,920
Just look at yourself.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
You probably aren't even as good as a brothel girl from Yihong Courtyard.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,880
At least they know how to serve people.

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,040
I was blind about people.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,480
I actually did it all for a beast like you.

14
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,040
I divorced Xiao Ning because of you.

15
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,920
I made him a laughingstock.

16
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,319
I owe Xiao Ning an apology.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
Even now, in your current state,

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,159
you're still thinking about that bastard Xiao Ning?

19
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,599
Fine.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,439
Since you regret it so much now,

21
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,359
I'll make you regret it even more.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,079
You beast!

23
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:27,840
Han Hongzhi!

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Let go of me!

25
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,480
Han Hongzhi, you beast!

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,680
Let her go!

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,799
Let go of me!

28
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,519
Xiao Ning!

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
You bastard!

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,599
I'm going to kill you!

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,760
Still so feisty, huh?

32
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,400
Perfect.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Send him to the dungeon.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,959
Let him be reformed together with Chancellor Han.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,439
Xiao Ning!

36
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,319
I won't let you get away with this.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,080
Survive the prison first, then we'll talk.

38
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,159
Young Master Xiao.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,879
It's all right now, it's all right.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,879
Xiao Ning

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,560
I looked down on you before.

42
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,879
Yet you were still willing to help me.

43
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,800
I...

44
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,800
After all, we've known each other for so long.

45
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,599
Come.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,199
I couldn't just

47
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,520
stand by and watch

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,919
that scoundrel Han Hongzhi bully you.

49
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,919
What are you doing?

50
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,159
It was my own blindness, Xueyan couldn't see your worth.

51
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,879
I never realized how good you are.

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,759
Everything that's happened is my own fault.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,319
I hope you can forgive me, Young Master Xiao.

54
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,360
Forgive me, please forgive me.

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,680
A girl kneeling to me—

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,479
What is this supposed to be?

57
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,520
Please, get up.

58
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,039
What's wrong with you now?

59
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,319
It's nothing.

60
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,039
I was probably just startled just now.

61
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,879
Thank you so much for today, Young Master Xiao.

62
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,479
If it weren't for you,

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,159
I'm afraid Ling Luo would have already...

64
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,840
No, no, no.

65
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,280
If Miss Ling Luo hadn't provided the evidence,

66
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,120
it wouldn't have been so easy to convict Han Wuguo.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,439
To repay you for avenging my father,

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,879
I, Ling Luo, am willing to serve under you.

69
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,520
I will follow you forever, Young Master Xiao.

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,879
With me?

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,439
Would you be willing to accept me?

72
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,840
Of course I would.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,639
Miss Ling Luo is a business genius of our time.

74
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,599
My business,

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,599
will expand to neighboring countries in the future.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,800
If I could have your help,

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,599
it would be like adding wings to a tiger.

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,680
Thank you for accepting me, Young Master Xiao.

79
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,080
I, Ling Luo, will always stay by your side.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,800
Are you okay?

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,360
I'm glad you're all right.

82
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,360
As long as you're okay.

83
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,480
Dad, look.

84
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,120
I wasn't lying to you, was I?

85
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,800
Our family now

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,839
can no longer be described

87
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,600
as just wealthy.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,079
Haven't we returned to the peak of business?

89
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,160
No,

90
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
we're several hundred times stronger

91
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,519
than the peak of the Xiao family.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,639
But what's the use of that?

93
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,399
No matter how much money you have, you still can't marry Jiang Yun

94
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,079
No,

95
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,519
the princess now.

96
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,040
The difference in status is just too great.

97
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,920
Why are you bringing this up again?

98
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Your mother, she...

99
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,399
Stop, stop, stop.

100
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,040
Alright.

101
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,480
Is Young Master Xiao here?

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,839
Eunuch Bai!

103
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,040
What brings you here?

104
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,959
Eunuch Bai.

105
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,199
Young Master Xiao, you are too polite.

106
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,759
His Majesty is concerned about Master Xiao's health

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,240
and specially sent this old servant to visit.

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,000
Master Xiao is much better now.

109
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm all better.

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,360
It's just a small matter, no need for His Majesty to worry.

111
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,279
I'm truly overwhelmed.

112
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,839
His Majesty often speaks of Master Xiao in the palace.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,879
He says he has long regarded Master Xiao

114
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,240
as a loyal friend.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,079
His Majesty is truly a great person.

116
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,759
And to trouble Eunuch Bai

117
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,279
to make a special trip here...

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,000
This time,

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not here just for this matter.

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,439
Xiao Ning.

121
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,040
Receive the imperial decree.

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,920
By the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

123
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,600
Xiao Ning rose from humble beginnings,

124
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,839
starting with a simple teahouse.

125
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,079
He has promoted the flourishing of literature in our great realm.

126
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,319
He has also enriched the national treasury with fine wines and sweet dew.

127
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,879
He has recovered all the wealth stolen by corrupt officials.

128
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,600
Later, he introduced newspapers as a new policy,

129
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,879
helping me to recruit talented individuals.

130
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,240
He has supported and strengthened the nation.

131
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,800
He has repeatedly rendered outstanding service to our country.

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,120
Now, I exceptionally confer upon Xiao Ning the title of First-Rank Duke.

133
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
He is awarded ten thousand taels of gold and a thousand bolts of silk.

134
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,079
He is granted a mansion.

135
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,959
May he never forget his original aspirations.

136
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,920
And continue to serve the nation.

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,399
By imperial command.

138
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

139
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,360
Thank you for Your Majesty’s great kindness.

140
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,519
My Lord Duke,

141
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,199
please accept the decree.

142
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
My son, my son

143
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,759
I always knew you would achieve great things one day

144
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,639
First-rank Duke

145
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
His Majesty has another verbal decree

146
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,360
Please, Duke, continue to listen to the imperial edict

147
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,399
Xiao Ning

148
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
You rascal

149
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,759
What are your plans about becoming the imperial son-in-law?

150
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,399
What imperial son-in-law?

151
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,240
I knew you would pretend to be confused

152
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,480
The princess also knows you don't want to be a live-in son-in-law

153
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,879
Let alone the most prominent one in the land

154
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,319
Therefore

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
We do not wish to force you

156
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,879
Today, I grant you the title of Duke

157
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,040
With your current status

158
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
You may marry the princess

159
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,600
This should be enough to resolve your concerns, right?

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Haven't you all already discussed and decided this?

161
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,600
You—

162
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
His Majesty also said

163
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,000
Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it

164
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,000
Someone like the Duke

165
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,240
A talent capable of shaking the nation

166
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,879
If he cannot be used by the royal family

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
Then it will inevitably—

168
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,480
This—this is forcing me to marry!

169
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,559
It's a blatant threat

170
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,600
You brat

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,360
You really don't know how lucky you are

172
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,159
Young Master Xiao

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
Let go of me!

174
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,879
Jiang Yun.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,759
Why are you here?

176
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,480
Why is Your Highness being so reckless?

177
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,519
Yan Lingluo.

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,879
Why are you here?

179
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,440
Young Master Xiao saved my life.

180
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,159
He also cleared my father and brother of false charges.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,879
Of course, I am deeply grateful.

182
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,440
I wish to...

183
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,679
...repay him with my hand in marriage.

184
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
Miss Lingluo, you can't say such things carelessly.

185
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,279
Aren't you here to help me?

186
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,039
Shut up!

187
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,240
You heard it just now.

188
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,759
My marriage to Xiao Ning

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,240
was personally arranged by my father, the Emperor.

190
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,679
Do you intend to defy the imperial will?

191
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,600
His Majesty's decree—

192
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,200
Of course, I wouldn't dare go against it.

193
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,600
But...

194
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,759
Young Master Xiao is now a first-rank Duke.

195
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,240
It's normal for him to have multiple wives and concubines.

196
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,559
I'm willing to be a concubine.

197
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,840
Greetings, elder sister.

198
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,559
You...

199
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,480
Get up!

200
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,919
Who are you calling elder sister?

201
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,000
How old are you?

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,879
And you call me elder sister?

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,720
This is all your fault!

204
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,919
If you don't kick her out today,

205
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,840
I won't let you off!

206
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,759
Don't be so fierce.

207
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,320
After all, you are still...

208
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,759
...a woman of ancient times.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
Besides, I'm already the Duke and imperial son-in-law.

210
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,519
How can you still treat me like this?

211
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,799
Xiao Ning, you—

212
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,679
What did you say?

213
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,399
Xiao Ning

214
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,279
My good son-in-law!

215
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,360
Mother, can you please stop making a scene?

216
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,399
Madam Su

217
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
Why are you here again?

218
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,360
Just seeing you gives me psychological trauma.

219
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,000
I know everything.

220
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,279
It was you who saved our Yan'er

221
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,600
from that brute Han Hongzhi.

222
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
As expected,

223
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,039
you are truly the good son-in-law of the Su family.

224
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,919
Madam Su,

225
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
please mind your words.

226
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,240
Xiao Ning now has

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,960
absolutely nothing to do with your Su family.

228
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,759
Good son-in-law,

229
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,120
your business is so successful now,

230
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,679
I'm just worried you can't handle it all.

231
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,360
And I don't want you to wear yourself out for nothing.

232
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,480
So,

233
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,480
why not let our Su family handle the newspaper business

234
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,960
and leave it to us?

235
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,799
Or the wine business would be fine too.

236
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,799
If you do that, I might even consider

237
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,080
letting you return to the Su residence

238
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,320
as our family's son-in-law again.

239
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,799
Mother,

240
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I've never seen anyone so shameless.

241
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,759
Today, Madam Su,

242
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
you've truly opened my eyes once again.

243
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,039
The Su family is dishonest in business.

244
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,399
As in-laws, they are disloyal.

245
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,679
They can't distinguish right from wrong and trust sycophants.

246
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,320
And now you still want Xiao Ning

247
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,120
to return to your Su family as a live-in son-in-law.

248
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,960
It's truly ridiculous.

249
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,960
Xiao Ning,

250
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm talking to you nicely,

251
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,000
so don't push your luck.

252
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,799
If our Su family hadn't taken you in back then,

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,440
how would you have what you do today?

254
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,399
A small favor should be repaid generously.

255
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,600
If you don't agree today,

256
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,080
then don't expect good days ahead.

257
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,559
Right now, I am—

258
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,279
How dare you!

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,279
Who do you think you are

260
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,519
to threaten a first-rank Duke?

261
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,080
He—

262
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,679
Xiao Ning

263
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,399
His Majesty has just granted Young Master Xiao

264
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,960
the title of first-rank Duke.

265
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,639
And you dare to question that?

266
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,120
The Su family's abilities are questionable, and they confuse right and wrong.

267
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,720
They are truly unfit for great responsibility.

268
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,519
Therefore, the Su family's status as imperial merchants is revoked.

269
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,879
As a warning to others.

270
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,720
You—

271
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,039
What right do you have to revoke—

272
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,840
How dare you!

273
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,399
Your Su family dares to question me, the Princess of Dajing?

274
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,879
Jiang Dongjia is actually the princess of Dajing.

275
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,840
And also,

276
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,600
Xiao Ning is now my prince consort.

277
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,200
If I still hear from your Su family

278
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,879
the word "son-in-law,"

279
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,480
I, the princess, will have your heads.

280
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,360
Young Master Xiao,

281
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
I'm going to get married first.

282
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,080
See you later.

283
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,919
You're about to become the prince consort and you still say "see you later" to her?

284
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,440
It's just a polite phrase.

285
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Why are you...

286
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,679
Why are you not gentle at all anymore?

287
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,440
Now you think I'm not gentle enough?

288
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Too late.

289
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,399
You used to be so unruly.

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,360
Once you become the prince consort, you can't act like that anymore.

291
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,720
Go back right now.

292
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,240
Read the etiquette books and the Prince Consort's Manual.

293
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,519
I have to read those too?

294
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Young Master Xiao,

295
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,679
Come back early.

296
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,879
I'm leaving.

297
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,559
Be gentle.

298
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,360
I cooked a lot of dishes.

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Don't even think about going back with her, I'm telling you.

300
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
No way, am I that kind of person?

301
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,639
From now on, as long as I'm around,

302
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,039
don't even think about looking at another woman.

303
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,120
If you dare look,

304
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,600
I'll gouge your eyes out.

305
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,279
Let's go.

306
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,919
Eunuch Bai,

307
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
let me treat you to some tea.

308
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,480
I have good tea here.

309
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,279
Master Xiao, after you.

310
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
Eunuch Bai, after you.

311
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,399
Xiao Ning actually became the prince consort of Dajing.

312
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,039
Watch your step.

313
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,840
Be careful where you step.

314
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
This is tea leaves.

315
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
We're picking tea.

316
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,039
You have to start picking from the tea tips.

317
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,120
That flower is so beautiful.

318
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,559
Look.

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,919
Don't run around.

320
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,480
Be careful.

321
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,960
Watch out, you might fall.

322
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,440
Childish.

323
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,399
Your hair got caught.

324
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,559
Ouch.

325
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,240
How dare you kiss me.

326
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Why do I feel like

327
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
you were the one who kissed me first?

328
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,840
Now you're denying it.

329
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,159
Come here.

330
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,559
Stop right there.

331
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,120
Don't run.
