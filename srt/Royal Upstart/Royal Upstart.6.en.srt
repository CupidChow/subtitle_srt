1
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,759
You have a drink too.

2
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,560
I'm just an old man now.

3
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,119
Why pretend to be tough?

4
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,520
I heard there will be some job recruitment later.

5
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,520
Let's see if there's any work available.

6
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,439
Dad.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,719
Son.

8
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,239
You weren't kicked out by the Su family, were you?

9
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,040
Dad.

10
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,719
Why are you here?

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,359
Our family house—

12
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,599
When did you sell it?

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,400
Young master.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,079
Actually, on the day you married into the Su family,

15
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,879
the house had already been mortgaged.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,519
Some time ago,

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,760
the master was driven out by the head of the Xiao family.

18
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,719
The master has had nowhere to go for a while.

19
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,959
I'm fine, son.

20
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,000
It's just an old house, that's all.

21
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:39,840
Here.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,439
Are you doing well in the Su family?

23
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,079
Dad.

24
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,519
I have money now.

25
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,480
Look.

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
You don't have to worry anymore.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,519
My son has grown up.

28
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,480
He knows not to spend money recklessly now.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,239
He even knows how to comfort his old man.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,159
I didn't comfort you.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,039
Forget it, it's not important.

32
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,879
You're right.

33
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,560
That house is so rundown.

34
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,560
It's fine if we don't go back.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,520
You pick a place.

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,960
Anywhere you like.

37
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,560
From now on, we'll have our own household.

38
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,560
What do you mean, our own household?

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,800
I, Xiao Hetai,

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
was born a member of the Xiao family,

41
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,560
and will die as one.

42
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,840
Starting our own household

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
means being removed from the Xiao family records.

44
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,680
That would be a disgrace to our ancestors.

45
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,080
That's not what I meant by our own household.

46
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,280
Alright, you should go now.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,919
All I want is for you to live well.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,000
Go on, go on.

49
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,879
Hurry, go.

50
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,599
How can I make Father believe me?

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,199
Go.

52
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad

53
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,680
You don't know

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Our family ancestral hall was smashed

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,319
What

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,680
Master

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,639
This black-glazed chicken-head pot looks nice

58
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,879
But the chicken head is broken off

59
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319
Do we still want it

60
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,960
Take it back to the residence

61
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,639
No reason not to take it if it's free

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,439
It's worthless once the head is broken off

63
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,000
Sir

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,039
You're not related to Grandet, are you

65
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,960
What

66
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,919
You didn't come back just for this pot, did you

67
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,520
You came back on purpose, right

68
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,000
Clan leader

69
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,800
How many things did you take from my house

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,319
Put them all back exactly as they were

71
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm buying this house

72
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,000
Name your price

73
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,439
Alright

74
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,879
Ten thousand taels

75
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,240
Ten thousand taels

76
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,280
Clan leader

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,680
I only mortgaged two thousand taels to you in the first place

78
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,560
It's fine

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,479
Bring it up

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,759
Come on, come on

81
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,039
Come, come

82
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,199
Be careful

83
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,960
Ten thousand taels

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,000
Take it

85
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,800
It's a deal

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,319
Nephew, once you buy it, no regrets

87
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,000
The deal is done

88
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:13,919
Yes

89
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,800
Son

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,240
Even if you have money, you can't spend it so recklessly

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,199
It's fine, Dad

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,879
What should we do now?

93
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,519
Master,

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,839
they said

95
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,920
another ten teahouses have returned our goods.

96
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,759
Master,

97
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,800
Sunan Hongyu Hall, Xian Teahouse,

98
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
and more than a dozen other shopkeepers have come.

99
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
They said if they can't get

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,680
our shop rent today,

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,319
they'll report us to the authorities.

102
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,120
Leave, leave.

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,279
Oh my heavens!

104
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,079
Mother,

105
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,839
this, this...

106
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,959
It's all your fault!

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,600
If you hadn't insisted that Young Master Wei

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,759
get the salt tea sales rights

109
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,480
for the three counties of Sunan to sell salt tea,

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,240
we wouldn't have ended up

111
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,759
with so much unsold inventory.

112
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,879
Now we're on the verge of bankruptcy.

113
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,800
Who could have known that the tea from Nongcha Pavilion

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,199
would sell all over the region?

115
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,160
Now, just one tael of Nongcha Pavilion's tea

116
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,639
is being sold for ten taels and people are fighting over it.

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,680
It's sold out every day.

118
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,079
But our salt tea

119
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,160
can't even sell for ten coins a tael.

120
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,279
If we could get Nongcha Pavilion's tea

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,279
to sell at our Su family estate,

122
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,120
that would be a good idea.

123
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,920
But would Nongcha Pavilion be willing to work with us?

124
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,560
That's right!

125
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
That good-for-nothing from the Xiao family

126
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,959
is working as a servant at Nongcha Pavilion, isn't he?

127
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:27,720
Let's go.

128
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,480
Let's see what that good-for-nothing is up to.

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,399
If I had known Father would suffer so much,

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,639
I should have returned to the Xiao family sooner.

131
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,959
You useless thing.

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,839
Where did you go?

133
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,279
I was hungry, so I grabbed something to eat.

134
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,120
You've been freeloading in our Su family for so long.

135
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Now,

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,839
it's time for you to prove your worth.

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,920
What do you mean?

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,560
You've been running errands at the Tea Pavilion for so long.

139
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,360
Have you managed to get close to the owner of the Tea Pavilion?

140
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,399
Don't tell me

141
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,079
they still haven't discovered my identity?

142
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,240
Say something!

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,199
Who is the owner of the Tea Pavilion?

144
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,000
What are his preferences?

145
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
You must tell me everything.

146
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,639
He's obsessed with money.

147
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,720
As long as it's a profitable business,

148
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
he never turns it down.

149
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,560
But can you tell me first,

150
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,519
what are you planning to do?

151
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,920
We plan to give him an opportunity.

152
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,319
Go and tell the owner,

153
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,399
that our Su family, one of the three great imperial merchants,

154
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,560
is willing to support the weak.

155
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,439
We can reluctantly

156
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,839
set aside our own business

157
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
to help him sell his tea.

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,959
So it turns out the Su family's salted tea isn't selling.

159
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,360
That's why you're asking others for help.

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
Is that any of your business?

161
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,959
You just need to tell me

162
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,399
where the owner of the Tea Pavilion is.

163
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,319
I think

164
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
he doesn't need your reluctant help.

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,399
You think

166
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,800
Who do you think you are?

167
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,319
How dare you act so insolent with me!

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,879
Before tomorrow

169
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,959
if you can't invite the owner of the Tea Pavilion,

170
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,600
I'll do it in front of everyone in Shangdu.

171
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,879
I'll summon Xiao Hetai to the Su residence

172
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,040
and take you back with me.

173
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,160
Don't use my father as an excuse.

174
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,759
I'm your elder.

175
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,600
What can you do to me?

176
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Su Xueyan,

177
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,680
you were the one who said salted tea would sell well.

178
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
Now it isn't selling.

179
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,120
And now you're forcing the Tea Pavilion to buy it.

180
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,279
Is this how the Su family does business?

181
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
This is the Su family's

182
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
business with the owner of the Tea Pavilion.

183
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,560
It has nothing to do with you.

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,920
Why are you still talking to him?

185
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,639
Hurry up and go invite him.

186
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,199
Remember,

187
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,480
before tomorrow.

188
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,000
No,

189
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,759
listen to what I have to say.

190
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,399
I...

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,199
Young Master Xiao

192
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
Please come with us.

193
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Which family are you from?

194
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,839
Even if the deal falls through, we should part on good terms.

195
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
Why are you kidnapping me?

196
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,399
Don't panic, Young Master Xiao.

197
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,920
We're just following orders.

198
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,519
Please cooperate with us.

199
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
The Prime Minister's residence.

200
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,000
What's wrong?

201
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,000
Then why are you doing this?

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
Who doesn't know the Prime Minister's residence?

203
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,800
It's the rule of the trade.

204
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,439
Please.

205
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,920
Could it be because of the last poetry gathering

206
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,120
where I offended Han Hongzhi?

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,519
Are you bringing me here today to vent your anger?

208
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,399
I... I need to use the restroom.

209
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,120
No, no, no.

210
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,440
Move.

211
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,000
No, no, no.

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
I can't hold it anymore, I can't hold it anymore.

213
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,240
I can't hold it.

214
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,080
Can't hold it.

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Last time I spent two thousand taels of silver

216
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,200
and still couldn't meet you.

217
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,000
Young Master Xiao, you're really hard to meet.

218
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,279
You're the one who wanted to discuss business with me last time.

219
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,000
So it wasn't Han Hongzhi who wanted to see me?

220
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,879
You even know my

221
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,200
good-for-nothing son?

222
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,519
Son?

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,480
Seeing how young this beautiful lady is,

224
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,279
I thought you were her older sister.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,960
Older sister?

226
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,000
How dare you!

227
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
This is the young concubine of the Prime Minister's residence.

228
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,720
Lady Lingluo.

229
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,759
Watch your tongue.

230
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,000
You're too talkative.

231
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,480
Please rise.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
I didn't expect, Young Master Xiao,

233
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,480
not only are you good at business,

234
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,399
but you also have such a sweet tongue.

235
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,000
May I ask why Miss Han asked me to come here?

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is the reason?

237
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,879
Lingluo is very interested in the Tea Pavilion.

238
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,399
I wonder, Young Master,

239
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,279
would you be willing to part with it for me?

240
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,039
Miss Han,

241
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,399
someone has already invested in the Tea Pavilion.

242
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,120
I, Xiao Ning, do not have full authority over the Tea Pavilion.

243
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,320
What does "invested" mean?

244
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,559
It means that when I was starting out,

245
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,919
I already found someone to invest.

246
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,600
Now, half of the Tea Pavilion's revenue

247
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,559
belongs to someone else.

248
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,240
Young Master Xiao, to think you could come up with

249
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,799
such a business method,

250
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,440
and even gave it a name.

251
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,840
Lingluo truly

252
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,480
admires you even more now.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,080
Since Miss Han and I

254
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
have no business to discuss,

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
I'll take my leave.

256
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,799
Why are you in such a hurry, Young Master Xiao?

257
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,559
Although we didn't reach an agreement about the Tea Pavilion,

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,240
we still have other business to discuss.

259
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,559
Other business?

260
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,519
But aside from the Tea Pavilion,

261
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,600
I have no other businesses.

262
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
Young Master, you

263
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,799
are my new business.

264
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,759
I

265
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
Although I do have some looks,

266
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,519
but

267
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,679
I've never thought about selling myself.

268
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,480
Lingluo admires you greatly, sir.

269
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,399
If you are willing to come to my side,

270
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,639
I'm willing to offer one hundred thousand taels of silver.

271
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,799
You may use it as you wish, Young Master Xiao.

272
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,600
Giving me one hundred thousand taels for nothing?

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,799
How could there be such a good deal in this world?

274
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,759
Miss Han, if you have any conditions, please state them clearly.

275
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,159
It's not a difficult matter.

276
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,039
As long as you return the principal to me within three years,

277
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,279
and give me thirty percent of the annual profits.

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,720
So you want to be my professional manager.

279
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,120
Professional manager?

280
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,080
You do know this method, sir.

281
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,240
Lingluo really wants to open up Young Master Xiao's head

282
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,720
and see how it works inside.

283
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,480
Auntie

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,679
The Prime Minister requests your presence.

285
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,440
Luor, who did you invite to the residence?

286
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,919
Why didn't you inform me?

287
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,360
Master

288
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,960
Lingluo only invited Young Master Xiao from the Tea Pavilion

289
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,080
to discuss some business.

290
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't expect to disturb you.

291
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,519
You are Xiao Ning?

292
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
Greetings, Prime Minister.

293
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,600
Enough with the small talk.

294
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
The Tea Pavilion—

295
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Are you selling

296
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,480
or not?

297
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,399
I have already discussed this with Miss Han.

298
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,679
I'm afraid I cannot agree to this.

299
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,080
Xiao Ning

300
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,480
My mother invited you into our residence

301
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,039
which is already a great honor for you.

302
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,440
Now you even dare to refuse my father.

303
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,840
Do you think the Han residence is so easy to enter?

304
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
The Han family really acts ruthlessly.

305
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,360
Staying alive is more important.

306
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,200
Not at all.

307
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,919
The Prime Minister personally made the request.

308
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,720
How could I possibly refuse?

309
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
It's just that...

310
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,679
I wonder how much your esteemed house is willing to offer me.

311
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,559
How much silver?

312
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,000
At the current price,

313
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,639
to acquire the Tea Pavilion,

314
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,360
it would cost about one hundred thousand taels of silver.

315
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,639
One hundred thousand taels?

316
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,320
For just this one tea shop?

317
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,320
In my opinion,

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,240
at most fifty thousand taels.

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,360
Xiao Ning,

320
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,799
do you have any objections?
