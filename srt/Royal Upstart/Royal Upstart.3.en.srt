1
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,759
Let's get straight to the point.

2
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,679
Today happens to mark the beginning of spring.

3
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,759
It's also the day when the Tea Pavilion launches its new products.

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,920
Why not make spring our theme?

5
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,439
Everyone, you may begin.

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,560
Green leaves sway gracefully in the wind.

7
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,439
Flowers bloom everywhere, vibrant and beautiful.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,159
I really want to secretly pick one.

9
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,280
And tuck it behind your left ear.

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,400
This poem is lacking.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
What is this?

12
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,400
The last two lines are at best

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,040
third-grade level.

14
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,879
Green clouds swirl and dance lightly.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,799
In dreams, the fragrance lingers in countless ways.

16
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,400
At midnight, spring thunder rumbles.

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,159
It scares me into diving under the covers.

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,560
It's all right, Miss Bai.

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
These are my feelings for you.

20
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,480
Since no one has produced a top-grade poem yet,

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,879
let Miss Su and I

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,280
present a poem for everyone.

23
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,480
Miss Su, please.

24
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,319
You're really putting on a show.

25
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,080
The east wind brings green across the land.

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
All things revive and show new faces.

27
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,120
Not bad.

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,599
My heart dances with the swallows' song and the breeze.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,879
Spring is full of vibrant life.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,159
Good.

31
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,000
Very good.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,879
Great poem.

33
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,719
Truly a great poem.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
What a wonderful poem.

35
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,759
Excellent poem.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,280
I didn't expect Young Master Wei to be so talented in literature.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,560
You're too kind, my friend.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
Miss Su responded beautifully.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,199
The structure of this poem is very well balanced.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,759
The imagery is clear and profound.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
Excellent poem.

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Is there anyone else who wants to go up?

43
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,479
Congratulations to both of you for winning the princess's calligraphy.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,319
Thank you, sir.

45
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,159
The Shangdu Poetry Gathering

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,000
is nothing special.

47
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,240
Who is that?

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,240
Who is this?

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,199
How arrogant!

50
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,680
Who is that?

51
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,759
I've never seen him before.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Young Master Xiao, what do you mean by that?

53
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,639
He's just boasting.

54
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
Such wording

55
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,479
is dull and ordinary.

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,599
There's really nothing beautiful about it.

57
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,800
It's not worthy of the tea from the Tea Pavilion.

58
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,280
Xiao Ning.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,560
What are you up to now?

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,639
Nothing.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,759
I just think

62
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,520
everyone's poems are too mediocre.

63
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,479
If Her Highness's calligraphy

64
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,319
really ends up in Wei Yihao's hands,

65
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,879
wouldn't it be wasted?

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,360
You—

67
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,680
Even Lord Lianzhang, Mr. Qianlin,

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
and Young Master Han

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,279
all gave it top marks.

70
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,319
If His Highness's calligraphy isn't given to me,

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,759
who else could it go to?

72
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,680
Me, of course.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,439
I haven't even composed a poem yet.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
You?

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
Are you kidding?

76
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,439
Xiao Ning,

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
stop talking nonsense.

78
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,600
You're embarrassing the Su family.

79
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,160
It's just composing a poem.

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,920
It's not something you can just do off the cuff.

81
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,519
Off the cuff?

82
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,160
Just like that?

83
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
Isn't he just a live-in son-in-law?

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,519
Can he even write poetry?

85
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,439
That's way too arrogant.

86
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,639
Exactly, and he says he can do it off the cuff.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,480
What's so impressive about that?

88
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,040
I invite everyone here to give me a topic.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll compose a poem within ten steps.

90
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,199
How about that?

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,199
A poem in ten steps?

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,680
Compose a poem in just ten steps

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,759
I think even the top three in the imperial exam

94
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,399
wouldn't dare make such a boast

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,759
He doesn't even know who he is anymore

96
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,560
Exactly

97
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,879
Auntie

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,279
Did you enjoy today's poetry gathering?

99
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,759
Poetry is not really my forte

100
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,519
I thought the Tea Pavilion sponsored the poetry event

101
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,839
because they had found a new business strategy

102
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,959
But from the looks of it

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,000
it's just a way to appear cultured

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
When it comes to business in Dajing

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
if you claim to be second best

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,759
no one would dare claim to be first

107
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,040
Such trivial matters aren't worth watching

108
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,240
Boring

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
Let's go

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm sure everyone here

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,079
has already tasted

112
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,879
the Tea Pavilion's Four Seasons Spring tea

113
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,800
I wonder if the taste of this tea

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,439
is the same as the salted tea you usually drink

115
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,000
It's not the same

116
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
That's right

117
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,920
Yuanli Green

118
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,399
Five-Colored Beauty

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,959
Leisurely Autumn

120
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,279
Worldly Dreams, Enchanting Fragrance, Pure as Xu

121
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,959
These are the base teas for making Four Seasons Milk Tea.

122
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,399
They are also from the Tea Pavilion.

123
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,680
Several new teas will be launched soon.

124
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,920
These teas can be brewed directly with hot water.

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,319
You’ll taste tea flavors you’ve never experienced before.

126
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Each of you try a different one.

127
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,639
Tell me how you feel after tasting it.

128
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,560
With your descriptions,

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,839
I can compose a poem in ten steps.

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
You must not only capture the feeling,

131
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
but also create a poem in ten steps.

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,319
This is much harder than the previous assigned topic.

133
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,360
It’s much more difficult.

134
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,439
So these are the base teas for Four Seasons Milk Tea.

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,600
Let’s try them first.

136
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,279
Yes, yes.

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,000
Hurry, try it! Try it!

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,040
What a fragrant tea!

139
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,839
My promotion is way too successful.

140
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,240
I really am a genius.

141
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:36,839
Everyone,

142
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,920
how does it taste?

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
It's delicious.

144
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,959
When I drink milk tea,

145
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,680
it's this tea aroma that I love.

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
This is good tea.

147
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,199
Although this tea is bitter,

148
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
it's not as salty and astringent as salted tea.

149
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,160
It's like a constantly flowing stream,

150
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,680
with ups and downs.

151
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,759
There's a rare freshness in the mouth.

152
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,120
Such good tea.

153
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
An expert.

154
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,959
A true connoisseur.

155
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,199
This tea has a lingering, mellow aftertaste.

156
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
Like a rainbow stretching endlessly across the sky.

157
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,120
Truly a top-quality tea.

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,279
Drink more, have some more.

159
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,720
Since Brother Xiao is so confident,

160
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,279
let me have the first cup.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,040
This cup of enchanting fragrance

162
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,919
reminds me of all these years

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,639
of hardship wandering away from home.

164
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,080
Brother Xiao, why not compose a poem inspired by this feeling?

165
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:37,919
Would you?

166
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,600
Of course.

167
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,799
At dusk, the distant mountains are dark.

168
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,120
The sky is cold, the humble house is poor.

169
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,639
From the brushwood gate, I hear a dog barking.

170
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,919
A traveler returns at night through wind and snow.

171
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,600
What a fine poem.

172
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,519
Xiao Ning

173
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,320
You

174
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,960
What do you mean, "you"?

175
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,320
Your husband here has memorized six hundred Tang and Song poems,

176
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,519
not for nothing.

177
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,600
I think Kong Sheng is just homesick.

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,039
Then let me recite this poem by Liu Changqing for you.

179
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,480
"Staying with the master of Mount Furong on a snowy night."

180
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,679
It'll move you so much you'll end up crying under your blanket.

181
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
This...

182
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,879
Wonderful.

183
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,879
Truly exquisite.

184
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,600
This poem

185
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,080
has simple words but deep meaning.

186
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,679
Especially this line:

187
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,440
"At the brushwood gate, I hear a dog bark,"

188
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,080
"A traveler returns on a snowy night."

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,159
It truly

190
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,960
expresses my longing for warmth in this world.

191
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,879
Indeed.

192
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,720
Brother Xiao,

193
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,080
I truly admire you.

194
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,240
I must admit I am not as good.

195
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720
Mr. Kong, you are too modest.

196
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,039
Wei Yihao

197
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,879
Do you have any objections?

198
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,919
You useless son-in-law.

199
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,360
How could you have such literary talent?

200
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,480
You must have secretly read Xueyan's poem.

201
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,080
This poem must have been written by Xueyan.

202
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,240
Young Master Wei makes a good point.

203
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,039
My sister is the most talented woman in Shangdu.

204
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,000
This Xiao Ning

205
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,399
must have secretly memorized

206
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,279
one of my sister's poems

207
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,120
to get by.

208
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
I heard the Su family's son-in-law really is a good-for-nothing.

209
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,919
He can't even read a single character.

210
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,679
Xiao Ning

211
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,240
This cup of worldly dreams leaves a lingering aftertaste.

212
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,360
And a sense of bitterness lingers in my heart.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,399
Let's see what you have to say.

214
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,080
Flowers fall on their own, water flows on its own.

215
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,879
One longing, two places of idle sorrow.

216
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,000
There is no way to dispel these feelings.

217
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,279
Just left my brow, yet it weighs on my heart.

218
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,440
What a beautiful poem.

219
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,120
Captivating, full of tender feelings and endless longing.

220
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:25,200
Just left my brow, yet it weighs on my heart.

221
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,519
What aftertaste, what bitterness?

222
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,799
I think you are full of spring feelings.

223
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,039
Since that's the case,

224
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,120
why not let the real

225
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,480
greatest female poet of all time,

226
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Madam Li Qingzhao,

227
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,799
teach you what delicate emotions are,

228
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,279
and how to express them gracefully.

229
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,639
Young Master Xiao,

230
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,039
how did you know I have someone in my heart?

231
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,919
Could it be that you...

232
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,480
You are the one I think of.

233
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,240
Miss Zhou, please behave yourself.

234
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,879
Young Master Xiao,

235
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,639
this is a poetry gathering.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,360
How improper this is.

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
Is it you?

238
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I knew it must be you, Young Master Xiao.

239
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,399
Young Master Xiao, say something.

240
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,200
Young Master Xiao,

241
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,440
Mind your behavior, mind your behavior.

242
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,399
Young Master Xiao,

243
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,919
Miss Zhou, let's go.

244
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
Young Master Xiao,

245
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,720
Young Master Xiao,

246
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,600
This cup is as clear and pure as water.

247
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,360
It brings peace to the heart.

248
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,039
It stirs no waves within.

249
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,639
Just like how I feel about you.

250
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,799
Please compose a poem with this feeling, Young Master Xiao.
