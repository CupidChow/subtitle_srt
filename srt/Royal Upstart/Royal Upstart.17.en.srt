1
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,359
You came too.

2
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,520
Have a seat.

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,399
Please, please.

4
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,000
The Han family is putting on such a grand display.

5
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,159
They must be trying to promote Xiaoyao Spring.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,359
Since it's to promote Xiaoyao Spring,

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,280
why invite

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,920
all the restaurants in the city to participate?

9
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,600
Look!

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,759
Master Chen is here.

11
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,200
This great scholar Qian Lin

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,799
is really coming to be a judge?

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
The Han family truly deserves to be called the top family in Dajing.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Teacher, you are always so busy.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,599
We really are disturbing you.

16
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,319
It's no trouble.

17
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,920
Young Master Xiao.

18
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,000
Greetings, sir.

19
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,439
A little drink to lift the mood.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,599
Don't overindulge today.

21
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,159
Teacher, please come in.

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,920
Alright, alright.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,680
Let's go.

24
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,799
Xiao Ning.

25
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,319
Have you seen the Han family's grand occasion?

26
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,239
If from now on

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,519
you serve the Han family faithfully,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm willing to give you a place to stay.

29
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,079
After today, your Han family

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,719
won't be so proud anymore.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,480
Xiao Ning

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,200
Since you moved into the Su family,

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,159
you've been calling out to customers at the entrance of the tea house.

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,480
It's been so long now,

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,000
and you're still greeting guests at the door.

36
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,000
It's truly laughable.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,639
Madam Su, I...

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,639
Xiao Ning,

39
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,479
A man born into this world

40
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,120
should have lofty ambitions.

41
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,919
By belittling yourself like this,

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
don't you feel ashamed before your parents

43
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,400
and your own life?

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,479
I conduct myself with integrity.

45
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,479
I am responsible for myself.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,000
So there's no need for your nagging.

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,120
After all, we are husband and wife.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,520
I just wanted to remind you.

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,639
If you wish to be protected by the Han family

50
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,520
and use your business skills,

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,120
you must restrain your reckless behavior.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,759
Stop competing and fighting with Young Master Han.

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,319
The fact that you can say this to me

54
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,680
shows that you have a good heart.

55
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,719
Then let me give you some advice as well.

56
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,120
What is it?

57
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,000
Han Hongzhi may seem like a refined gentleman on the surface,

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
but he actually harbors ill intentions.

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,400
I suggest you

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,800
stay away from him and the Han family.

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
Xiao Ning,

62
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,599
even at this point,

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
you still try to sow discord

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,120
between me and Young Master Han.

65
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,840
You truly don't know how to repent.

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,199
Young Madam,

67
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,840
for you to come up with the idea for this wine-tasting event

68
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,280
shows you've made further progress in business.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
I truly admire you, Hongzhi.

70
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,199
This idea actually came from Young Master Xiao.

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,840
Hongzhi understands.

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,759
You value Xiao Ning's business skills.

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,719
But if you say such prosperity

74
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,120
is all because of Xiao Ning,

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,919
no one would believe it.

76
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,039
Young Master Xiao is indeed very talented.

77
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,039
If you compete with him,

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,319
it will only harm the Han family and bring no benefit.

79
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Since Su Xueyan is already in your grasp,

80
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,319
why can't you make peace with him?

81
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,360
Since Madam herself has spoken,

82
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,639
as long as Xiao Ning loyally serves the Han family,

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,919
I naturally won't hold anything against him.

84
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,120
Young Master Hongzhi, to have such magnanimity

85
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,719
is excellent.

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,639
Young Master Xiao, what exactly do you do?

87
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,959
Why are you at the wine banquet?

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Why are you at the poetry gathering?

89
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,680
You're everywhere!

90
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Exactly.

91
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,519
Isn't this just forcing someone into something they're not ready for?

92
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,120
The Han family is hosting the Wine Immortal Gathering,

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,360
how could they let you preside over it?

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,439
Everyone is right.

95
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,639
Young Master Han is here.

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,759
At the Wine Immortal Gathering hosted by the Han family,

97
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,480
how can we let a servant preside over it?

98
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,519
This young master

99
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,360
still didn't take my words to heart.

100
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,160
He won't amount to much.

101
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,040
Young Master Han, you mean

102
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,879
you want to preside over it yourself?

103
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,439
For this Wine Immortal Gathering, my Han family

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
has truly put in a lot of effort.

105
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
If we let a servant host the ceremony,

106
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,160
it would be an insult to all our distinguished guests.

107
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I, Hongzhi, may be presumptuous,

108
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,680
but I am willing to preside over this Wine Immortal Gathering.

109
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,560
Young Master Han has a noble status,

110
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,839
and is outstanding in both character and learning.

111
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,160
He should naturally be the host.

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,319
Indeed.

113
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,240
Young Master Hongzhi is much better than

114
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,199
those servants who came out of nowhere.

115
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,560
Much more respectable.

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,519
With the Prime Minister's son personally presiding,

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,240
this banquet will surely become famous.

118
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
Please let Young Master Han be the host.

119
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:38,839
Yes.

120
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,439
Yes, yes, yes.

121
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,399
That's right, let Young Master Han preside.

122
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,360
A servant is just a servant.

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,879
They can never stand above their masters.

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
Such a thankless task,

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,600
and yet they're fighting to do it.

126
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,480
Take it away quickly.

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
Then I can have some peace.

128
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,399
Well then,

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
today

130
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,160
Foolish.

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,279
That's my pretend microphone.

132
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,399
You have to hold it upright.

133
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,560
Today, our Han family is hosting the Wine Immortal Gathering.

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,759
This is not a competition of status.

135
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,439
It is truly a gathering for refined enjoyment.

136
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,399
The aim is to appreciate and select the finest.

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,079
For this Wine Immortal Gathering,

138
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,120
we have specially invited the esteemed master, the Sage of Wine, Chen Daru.

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,279
to judge the wines today.

140
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,160
Master Chen, Mr. Chen Daru.

141
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,279
At the same time, our Han family is willing

142
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,480
to offer cash rewards

143
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,639
to those who place first, second, and third.

144
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,160
They will receive three thousand taels and one thousand taels respectively.

145
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,120
That much?

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
The champion will receive six thousand taels.

147
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Six thousand taels?

148
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,759
Six thousand taels!

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,639
The Han family is offering a total of ten thousand taels.

150
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,000
Ten thousand taels!

151
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,600
What a generous offer!

152
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,160
If our wine happens to be chosen,

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,399
we'll gain a lot as well.

154
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,279
Yes, that's right.

155
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,319
You make it sound so real.

156
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,199
Your wine is nothing more than

157
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,639
something the Han family deliberately brought in

158
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,560
to serve as a stepping stone to highlight Xiaoyao Spring.

159
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,160
Such scheming.

160
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,439
It definitely wasn't that fool Han Hongzhi's idea.

161
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,480
He couldn't have come up with it.

162
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,120
It must be Yan Lingluo's idea.

163
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,079
But no matter how you try to outmaneuver each other,

164
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,399
you wouldn't expect me to be the one benefiting in the end.

165
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,519
The registration for wines from each restaurant

166
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,759
was completed yesterday.

167
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,639
Now, all the wines are ready.

168
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,399
Next, let's invite

169
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,040
the Sage of Wine, Chen Daru, to judge the wines.

170
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,720
So many wines!

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,439
Yes.

172
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,959
Who will be chosen?

173
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,959
The wines entered in this competition

174
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,720
have all been anonymized and assigned numbers.

175
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,480
With the reputations of the Han family and Master Chen as guarantors,

176
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,439
this selection is absolutely fair.

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,439
The Han family is upright and honorable.

178
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,519
Truly worthy of being the top family in our realm.

179
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,480
My former mother-in-law's flattery skills

180
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,959
are truly masterful.

181
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,920
Let the Wine Sage judge the wine.

182
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,799
Wine number one has a light and elegant aroma.

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,879
It also has a fruity taste upon entry.

184
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,279
But it lacks a lasting finish.

185
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,919
I rate it as "Middle Second Class."

186
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,919
This is what you call favoritism.

187
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,240
I wonder which family's wine this is.

188
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,399
This number one wine

189
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,000
is the Green Plum Wine from Baihua Pavilion.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
We didn't make it.

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,840
Even the Green Plum Wine only got a "Middle Second Class" rating.

192
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,360
It seems the standards for this wine event are very strict.

193
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,039
Next, let Master Chen taste wine number two.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,960
This one isn't even as good as the last.

195
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,879
How many wines are competing today?

196
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,600
Replying to Madam,

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,399
there are a total of fifteen kinds.

198
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
Which number is my Xiaoyao Spring?

199
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,279
Number seven.

200
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,639
Perfect.

201
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,120
Let the other wines whet the guests' appetites first.

202
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,360
Please taste wine number seven.

203
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,759
Very well.

204
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,840
It seems this is Xiaoyao Spring.

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,000
It's still that familiar taste.

206
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Mid-Grade A

207
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,960
Master Chen is so fond of this wine,

208
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,840
why did he only rate it as Mid-Grade A?

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,360
Why is it just a "mid" rating?

210
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,480
Does this old man even know how to judge wine?

211
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,440
If my guess is correct,

212
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,840
this wine number seven must be

213
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,039
the Xiaoyao Spring produced by the Han family.

214
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,159
The reason I gave it a Mid-Grade A rating

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,799
is not because I have any criticism of this wine.

216
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,039
It's just that I've been drinking it every day lately,

217
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
so I'm extremely familiar with it.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,519
But we out-of-town merchants haven't tried it yet!

219
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,440
Hurry and bring some for us to taste!

220
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,320
Let us try it too!

221
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,360
That's right!

222
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,679
Yes, yes, yes!

223
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Come on, come on!

224
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,200
Here, pour me a cup!

225
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,600
It really is good wine! I'll have another cup.

226
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
It really is good wine!

227
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,919
Manager Wu, slow down with your drinking!

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
The rest of us haven't tried it yet!

229
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,120
Such fine wine!

230
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Everyone, no need to fight over it.

231
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,279
My Han family has plenty in stock.

232
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,919
Today, as long as you're a guest at this event,

233
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,399
you can all buy Xiaoyao Spring at a 20% discount.

234
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,039
Then I'll take ten jars!

235
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,039
I'll take twenty jars!

236
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll take fifty jars!

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,919
I want some too! Me too!

238
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,919
I want some too!

239
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,120
Me too!

240
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,039
Buy more, buy more!

241
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,960
Take some home and enjoy it slowly.

242
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes, that's right.

243
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,159
Come on, come on.

244
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,840
Give me twenty jars.

245
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,120
Young master's method really works.

246
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,039
Miss Han was able to use my suggestion.

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,480
She made Xiaoyao Spring shine.

248
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,480
No wonder you truly understand the ways of business.

249
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,559
This idea came from the young master.

250
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,759
Xiaoyao Spring was also blended by the young master.

251
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,240
Lingluo admires the young master even more.

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
It's all just to make money.

253
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
Miss Han, no need to be so polite.

254
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,039
If Young Master Xiao is willing,

255
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,120
Lingluo would like to invite you

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,440
to be the general manager of all Han family businesses.

257
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,639
You want me to be the boss?

258
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,519
But unfortunately, the board is all your Han family members.

259
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,799
I don't want to take the blame for working for others.

260
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,440
No need.

261
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,080
I'm not a good fit for the Han family.

262
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
But it's because of Hongzhi.

263
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,000
Then you don't need to worry, sir.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,559
I can have my master

265
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
personally step in and give some advice.

266
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,159
I guarantee he won't trouble you again in the future.

267
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:26,879
No.

268
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,440
It's really not because of Han Hongzhi.

269
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Then why is it?

270
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,000
The Han family, in the marketplace,

271
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
uses their noble status to bully and dominate the market.

272
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,559
They engage in monopolistic practices of merger and takeover.

273
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,120
I don't think that's the true nature of business.

274
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,919
I'm not a good fit with the Han family.

275
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,919
So let's just forget it.

276
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,399
Sir, could you reconsider?

277
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,559
Miss, there's no need to say more to him.

278
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,000
Look at how grand this banquet is.

279
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,320
Our Han family's Xiaoyao Spring

280
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,080
will soon monopolize the entire Dajing liquor business.

281
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,000
As long as he wants to do business,

282
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
he'll have to come begging to the Han family.

283
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,240
I'm afraid today's banquet ends here.

284
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,240
I think the title of "Immortal of Wine"

285
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,200
can only belong to Xiaoyao Spring.

286
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,840
That's right.

287
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,720
It's all thanks to Young Master Hongzhi.

288
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,320
Today, we too can

289
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,000
rise to success with this wine.

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,679
Yes.

291
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,399
Yan'er,

292
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
this time you really found the right person.

293
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,080
These two wines, number twelve and thirteen,

294
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
what are their names?

295
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,200
They're equally matched.

296
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,799
They're truly heavenly wines.
