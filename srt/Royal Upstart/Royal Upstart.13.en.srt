1
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,600
This is the taste.

2
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,119
I finally made it.

3
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,359
Hero.

4
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,799
Our family is already bankrupt.

5
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,599
There's nothing valuable left.

6
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,280
Why don't you try another place?

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,280
I promise I won't report you to the authorities.

8
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,120
These past few days,

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
you've earned nearly ten thousand taels of silver for the Han family.

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,000
And you still claim you have no money.

11
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,879
Jiang Yun.

12
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,879
What are you doing?

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,599
You scared me out of my wits.

14
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,519
You still have a heart?

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,159
Ow, ow, ow!

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,959
Then I'll have Qingfeng cut your heart out.

17
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,519
Let's see what color it really is.

18
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,120
Beat him for me.

19
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,280
Wait, what are you doing?

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
You spilled my wine.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,799
How am I supposed to deal with the Han family now?

22
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,200
Didn't you already side with the Han family?

23
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,200
Don't think you can trick us into letting you go.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,840
No, no, no.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,359
I have both old and new grudges against the Han family.

26
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,840
Why would I side with the Han family?

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,959
Then how do you explain

28
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,840
that Xiaoyao Spring is only sold to the Han family?

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,840
Aren't you just making money for them that way?

30
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,280
That was a ruse to lure the enemy.

31
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,920
I made them invest enough

32
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,479
of Xiaoyao Spring.

33
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,240
When the time comes, I'll give you something even better.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,039
That way, we'll catch them off guard.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,199
Even the Wine Sage can't stop praising Xiaoyao Spring.

36
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,039
How could there be an even better wine?

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
That old man

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,560
has never even tasted real good wine.

39
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,120
I...

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
This Jade Nectar on my table

41
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
is hundreds of times better than Xiaoyao Spring.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,599
If you don't believe me, try it.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,919
Really.

44
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,039
This is Xiaoyao Spring.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
And this is Jade Nectar.

46
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,840
Miss, this really is Xiaoyao Spring.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,280
I tasted it when I snuck into Wangjiang Tower.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,120
This wine is rich and strong.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
It also has a unique aroma.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
It's just a bit strong.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,199
It smells so good.

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,319
It seems to have a grain aroma.

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,199
This wine is delicious.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,039
Not only does it have a unique flavor,

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,840
it also has the aroma of various grains.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,960
The fragrance lingers on the lips and teeth.

57
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,520
And it doesn't have any unpleasant roughness.

58
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,479
It's truly a top-quality wine.

59
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,479
Of course.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,879
I made this using five different grain spirits

61
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,840
and distilled them together.

62
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:10,759
It's comparable to

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,960
several fine wines I tasted in my previous life.

64
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,720
In my previous life, as a top salesperson,

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I basically grew up surrounded by wine.

66
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,759
This really is excellent wine.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's definitely a hundred times better than Xiaoyao Spring.

68
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
So,

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
did you come here today

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
just to beat me up?

71
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,319
Young Master Xiao, it was all my fault.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,639
I listened to rumors,

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,600
and made reckless guesses.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,240
That's why Miss misunderstood you.

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,279
You're an accomplice.

76
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,360
But your apology is sincere.

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,279
I forgive you.

78
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,240
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,639
However,

80
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,600
some people have known me for so long,

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,519
yet they suspect me of colluding with the Han family.

82
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,439
If she doesn't apologize properly,

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
this Jade Nectar Elixir

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,279
I won't give it to her.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,240
You—

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,160
Qingfeng, you head back first.

87
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,199
I have something to discuss with Young Master Xiao.

88
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,920
Miss, this really was our fault.

89
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,240
Why don't you just give in a little?

90
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,600
You're silly.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,439
How can I apologize with you here?

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
Alright, Miss, I'll leave now.

93
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,439
I didn't expect that.

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
You really care about your pride.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Xiao Ning.

96
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,439
It was my fault, Jiang Yun's fault.

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,600
I shouldn't have doubted you.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,839
Apologizing isn't like paying respects at a grave.

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
If you bow again like that,

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
I'll lose ten years of my life.

101
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,199
This won't do, that won't do either.

102
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,199
What exactly do you want?

103
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,959
You have quite a temper.

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,560
Alright, I won't tease you anymore.

105
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,600
Have a seat.

106
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,040
Since we've cleared the air,

107
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,199
let's have a drink together.

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,319
Let's dig a pit for the Han family together.

109
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,920
Now that's more like it.

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll drink first.

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,639
You...

112
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,920
This doesn't seem like an apology at all.

113
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,279
You look more like a drunkard.

114
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
You've already mixed so many drinks.

115
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,759
Even this little bottle,

116
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,879
you can't bear to give it to me?

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,759
This is strong sorghum liquor.

118
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,600
You can't handle drinking it like this.

119
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,920
Why aren't you drinking?

120
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,839
Is it because you don't see me as a friend?

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm getting angry now.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,519
Drink!

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Okay.

124
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,439
Today, I'll risk my life to keep you company.

125
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,720
Sit down.

126
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,879
Come on.

127
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,439
I'll teach you a game I played as a child.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,959
It's called Rock, Paper, Scissors.

129
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:33,959
This is rock.

130
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,160
This is scissors, and this is paper.

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,680
Alright.

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,959
After I say "rock, paper, scissors,"

133
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,199
we both make our move at the same time.

134
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,920
We'll know who wins in a moment.

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Let's go.

136
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,120
Rock, paper, scissors!

137
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,560
Who won?

138
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,399
Scissors beats rock.

139
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,040
So I win.

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,879
You drink.

141
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,879
Again.

142
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:57,759
Again.

143
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,319
Rock, paper, scissors!

144
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,000
I win.

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,759
I'll drink, I'll drink.

146
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,519
Again.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,199
Rock, paper, scissors!

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,639
This...

149
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,040
How about this?

150
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,720
Scissors beats your paper.

151
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,560
So you have to drink.

152
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
Ning'er.

153
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you know what time it is?

154
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
Why are you still not...

155
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,960
And this is...?

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,440
Dad, keep your voice down.

157
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Ning'er, you...

158
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,679
Xiao Ning.

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,759
Ning'er.

160
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
What did you do to me?

161
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,279
Weren't you the one who drank too much yesterday?

162
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,679
You wouldn't get off my bed.

163
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,960
You shameless old thing.

164
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,919
What are you looking at?

165
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,000
Go, get out of here.

166
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,960
Ning'er.

167
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
Who is this young lady?

168
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
You go out too.

169
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,399
There are only two steamed buns here.

170
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,679
If it's not enough, I'll bring more.

171
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,840
Xiao Ning

172
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
You're dead meat.

173
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,360
Ning'er

174
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,720
Ning'er

175
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
You have someone you like now.

176
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,159
Why didn't you tell your father?

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,559
So I can find someone to propose on your behalf.

178
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,399
I already said it was a misunderstanding.

179
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,320
Excuse

180
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
I told you, it was a misunderstanding.

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,679
Please stop pestering me.

182
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,559
Jiang Yun and I are just

183
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,840
very good business partners.

184
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
We just got carried away chatting and drank a bit more.

185
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,399
Jiang Yun

186
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,759
Not bad, not bad.

187
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,879
That's a good name.

188
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
Why did I say Jiang Yun's name out loud?

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,240
This Miss Jiang is not only beautiful,

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,919
but also knows how to do business.

191
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,759
This is

192
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,679
the most suitable daughter-in-law for our Xiao family.

193
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Where does her family live?

194
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,639
I'll get a matchmaker to propose right away.

195
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,120
You're getting more and more ridiculous.

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,080
How did this turn into matchmaking?

197
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,919
I have things to do, I won't talk to you anymore.

198
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,360
I'm leaving.

199
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,840
You—

200
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
Ning'er, Ning'er!

201
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,279
Butler

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Go and find out properly

203
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,480
about this Miss Jiang Yun.

204
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm waiting to have a grandson!

205
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,440
Yes, Master.

206
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,919
Your son greets Father and Mother.

207
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,720
Yun'er

208
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,720
You didn't come home all night yesterday.

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,159
Where did you go?
