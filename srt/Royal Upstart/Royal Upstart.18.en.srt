1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,159
These two wines, number twelve and thirteen,

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,280
what are their names?

3
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,280
They're equally matched.

4
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,880
They're truly heavenly treasures.

5
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,359
What do you mean?

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,439
Are they even better than Xiaoyao Spring?

7
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,640
Yeah, how is that possible?

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,560
No way.

9
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,280
Th-this...

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,320
It's a pity your Han family went to such lengths,

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,920
only to benefit my disciple in the end.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,560
Could it be that in this competition,

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,280
there are actually wines better than Xiaoyao Spring?

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,319
And two of them appeared at once?

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,760
Master Chen, are you drunk?

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,079
How could there be two

17
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,840
wines better than Xiaoyao Spring?

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Yeah, Master, you must be drunk.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,359
How could I, the great Wine Sage, be drunk?

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,000
Number twelve is smooth and sweet.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,200
Number thirteen is rich and full-bodied.

22
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,959
It even has a unique sauce-like aroma.

23
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,719
Both are truly heavenly treasures.

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,400
Really?

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,359
Let me try them.

26
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,480
The master truly lives up to his reputation.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920
Every word he says

28
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,159
sounds like an advertisement.

29
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,079
Isn't this exactly the slogan for light-aroma

30
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,359
and sauce-aroma baijiu?

31
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,040
It's even more delicious.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,120
I didn't expect that.

33
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,680
Pour me another glass.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
How is that possible?

35
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,159
In a single day,

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,959
to taste such fine wine—

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,039
it truly is a heavenly delicacy.

38
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,759
This No. 13 wine is smooth on the palate,

39
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,719
with a rich sauce aroma.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,599
It suits my taste perfectly.

41
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,960
It really suits my taste.

42
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,560
Yes, indeed.

43
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,400
Personally, I think it's even better than Xiaoyao Spring.

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,199
It's more than a hundred times better.

45
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,000
Another glass, please.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Pour me another.

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,000
This No. 12 wine truly has a pure and elegant aroma.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
The aftertaste lingers on.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
I really like it.

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,360
I like it very much.

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,719
Miss, what do you think?

52
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,680
Hongzhi.

53
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,400
Quick, tell me the names of these two wines.

54
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,280
This is really good wine.

55
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,439
Such good wine!

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,520
Wine number twelve is called Yuxian Wine.

57
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,680
Wine number thirteen is called Minggong Wine.

58
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,520
Young Master Xiao, how did you know

59
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,159
the names of these two wines?

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,840
Could it be that these are also made by the Han family?

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,319
Of course not.

62
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,159
These wines come from Yuxian Restaurant.

63
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,759
Yuxian Restaurant?

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
Yuxian Restaurant!

65
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,520
This...

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,080
Yuxian Restaurant!

67
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,120
Quick, have Madam prepare some silver.

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
Let's go to Yuxian Restaurant.

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,280
Let's get Minggong Wine and Yuxian Wine.

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,879
I'm going too! Me too!

71
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,360
If we're late, it'll be like missing out at the tea house.

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,919
We won't get any.

73
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,560
Don't go!

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,680
Hurry, hurry!

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,319
Don't go!

76
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,120
Everyone's going to get some.

77
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,759
Then I'll go too.

78
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,479
Manager Li, don't go!

79
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,759
If we're late, we won't get to drink any.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,639
Wouldn't that be a lifelong regret?

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Slow down!

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,080
Manager Xu, don't go!

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,439
What about the promised Xiaoyao Spring?

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
I can give you an even lower price.

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,639
Young Master Han.

86
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,800
Let me go to Yuxian Restaurant first.

87
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,680
To get Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

88
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,719
Let's talk about this later, later.

89
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,039
Manager Xu.

90
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,680
What's going on here?

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,360
This

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,280
Xiao Ning, is this your doing again?

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,039
Xiao Ning

94
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,879
As expected, you didn't

95
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,400
listen to my advice at all.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,479
Since you are a servant of the Han family,

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
what good does it do you to act like this?

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360
He must have done it on purpose.

99
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,240
He just can't stand seeing us live well.

100
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,920
Even if you're jealous

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,800
of Young Master Hongzhi's talent and looks,

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,879
you still shouldn't do such disgraceful things.

103
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,600
Fine, fine, fine.

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
Every time I hear you argue,

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,199
it gives me a headache.

106
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,920
Who told you

107
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,279
that I'm a servant of the Han family?

108
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm the founder of Xiaoyao Spring.

109
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,800
I brewed this wine myself.

110
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,680
We're supposed to be good partners,

111
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,079
so how did I become a servant?

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,199
What?

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
You brewed Xiaoyao Spring?

114
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,959
Why don't you just say this Wangjiang Pavilion

115
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,000
belongs to your family too?

116
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,920
Xiao Ning, oh Xiao Ning,

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,360
I thought after not seeing you for a few days,

118
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,920
you just hadn't improved much.

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Who knew you'd start daydreaming instead?

120
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,360
Utterly fake.

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
Enough.

122
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,879
I...

123
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,160
Young Master Xiao

124
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,480
Let’s speak frankly.

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,480
The new wine at Yuxian Pavilion

126
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,079
is probably your handiwork too, isn’t it?

127
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,839
Yes.

128
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,759
You brewed one kind of wine for our Han family,

129
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,199
but you brewed two kinds for Yuxian Pavilion.

130
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,040
And both are even better wines.

131
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,800
That’s right.

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,360
Did he really brew them?

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,040
Xiao Ning

134
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,279
Do you really think our Han family

135
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,199
is easy to take advantage of?

136
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,879
Hongzhi

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,680
Step back for now.

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,160
Son-in-law

139
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,800
Son-in-law

140
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,800
Master

141
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,480
Master

142
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,360
Are we just letting this go?

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,639
Young Master Xiao

144
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,720
I know you have some criticisms about how our Han family does things.

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,839
You’ve made some subtle remarks.

146
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,800
Today’s Wine Immortal Gathering

147
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,839
was probably your warning to me.

148
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,560
I, Lingluo, truly accept your advice.

149
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,079
But let’s talk business.

150
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,600
I, Lingluo, would like to ask you,

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,759
to give a portion of the sales rights for Yuxian Wine

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,839
and Minggong Wine

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,600
to our Han family.

154
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,759
As for the pricing, it’s entirely up to you.

155
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
I’m sorry,

156
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
but the sales rights for these two wines

157
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,000
have already been given entirely to Yuxian Pavilion.

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,920
I truly can’t help you with this.

159
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,000
Yuxian wine fills the pot with fragrance.

160
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,720
Such fine brew, unmatched in the world.

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Thank you.

162
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,360
Famous wine warms the heart.

163
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,199
One sip is unforgettable, bringing cheerful laughter.

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,439
The words are catchy and easy to recite.

165
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,680
Simple and easy to understand.

166
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,879
Xiao Ning is truly talented.

167
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,199
Indeed, Miss.

168
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,600
Our Yuxian Pavilion's guests

169
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,399
are lining up all the way outside Shangdu City.

170
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Fortunately, you have a keen eye for talent, Miss.

171
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,000
That's how Young Master Xiao came to serve our royal family.

172
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,480
At first, I did intend

173
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,000
to use Xiao Ning's status to save the inner treasury.

174
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,319
But after spending time with him,

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,519
I no longer see him as

176
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,720
just an ordinary merchant.

177
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,279
Miss,

178
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,199
have you developed feelings for Young Master Xiao?

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
So you noticed as well.

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000
But Miss,

181
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,000
Young Master Xiao was once the Su family's son-in-law, after all.

182
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,839
And his reputation isn't very good.

183
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,199
I'm afraid His Majesty will have a hard time agreeing.

184
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,839
We both know what kind of person Xiao Ning is.

185
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,959
Don't we?

186
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,439
Let's not bring up those old matters again.

187
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,560
Miss,

188
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,800
I wasn't speaking ill of Young Master Xiao.

189
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,399
It's just that his status is indeed different from yours.

190
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,079
Jiang Yun.

191
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,120
Young Master Xiao.

192
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,279
What is Qingfeng saying about me this time?

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,840
It's nothing.

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,559
It was Qingfeng who said it.

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,559
Thanks to you making use of the Han family's Wine Immortal Gathering,

196
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,639
you promoted Yuxian Wine

197
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,320
and made Minggong Wine famous.

198
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,320
She wants to thank you properly.

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,639
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

200
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,200
Now is not the time for formalities.

201
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,679
Relying on Yuxian Restaurant alone

202
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,159
won't sell much wine.

203
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,639
We should strike while the iron is hot.

204
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,720
We need to win back those who rejected us before,

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,960
specifically the imperial merchants from the Huang and Lin families.

206
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,759
That's true.

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
If we can get help from the imperial merchants,

208
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,919
then our wine business

209
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,639
can reach all parts of Dajing.

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,399
That's right.

211
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,919
Even if we defeat all the Han family restaurants

212
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,639
in Shangdu City right now,

213
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,919
it wouldn't really affect them.

214
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,000
Alright.

215
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,799
I'll go find Lord Zhang now

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,720
and have him prepare

217
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,759
all the necessary travel documents and marketing certificates.

218
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,879
Then I'll go see the managers of the Huang and Lin families.

219
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,679
Miss, Young Master Xiao,

220
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,320
there are too many people up ahead, let's go around the back.

221
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm not that stupid.

222
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,519
Young Master Xiao and our princess

223
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,000
are indeed quite a good match.

224
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Your Majesty,

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,879
good news, very good news!

226
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,559
Your Majesty,

227
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,679
What is it, my loyal subject?

228
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,559
Your Majesty,

229
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
since the Wine Immortal Gathering,

230
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,480
the two new wines at Yuxian Pavilion

231
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,679
have already far outsold Xiaoyao Spring.

232
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,399
Everyone is praising them.

233
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,600
These are the wines that Xiao Ning, Young Master Xiao,

234
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,600
brewed especially for Her Highness the Princess:

235
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,799
Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

236
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,320
Her Highness ordered this old minister not to delay

237
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,679
and to report to Your Majesty immediately.

238
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,639
Brewed by Xiao Ning.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,799
Exactly.

240
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,519
Pour it.
