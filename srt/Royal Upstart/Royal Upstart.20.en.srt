1
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,320
I heard from my son

2
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
that after drinking, getting a massage from Master Yi

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,039
can help keep your energy and blood flowing smoothly.

4
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,640
It feels great.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,679
Ning'er,

6
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,240
I've put a lot of thought into your future,

7
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,399
really spent a lot of effort.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,319
Come and massage my legs for me.

9
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll gently massage your legs.

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,799
No, that's not good.

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm cramping, I'm cramping!

12
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,640
Brother Jiang,

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,239
are you okay?

14
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,439
It hurts at first,

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,079
but it feels better after a while.

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,640
Then I'll try to bear it.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Hang in there.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,319
Ah, ah, ah—

19
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,519
Cramping, cramping!

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,000
It's still okay.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,439
Okay? How is this okay?

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,439
I can't take it anymore.

23
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,239
It's fine.

24
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,239
Let me apply this medicine.

25
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,680
Soon, you'll feel as light as a swallow.

26
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,200
That guy named Xiao

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,959
You're making me suffer here

28
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,000
Brother Jiang

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,079
Hang in there, it'll be over soon

30
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,840
What?

31
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,640
You took me there

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,359
For the full package of dining and massage

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,159
And used it on Jiang Yun's father

34
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,599
Jiang Yun and I never thought about it that way

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Aren't you just making things more complicated?

36
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,079
Don't even think about fooling your old man

37
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,799
Can you really say you have no feelings for Miss Jiang?

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,319
No lying

39
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,359
I...

40
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,240
I do have some feelings for Miss Jiang

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,960
But the Han family is watching us closely right now

42
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,879
Let's talk about this later

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,360
Ning'er

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,840
There's more to life than just business

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,879
Back then, I was only focused on business

46
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,879
So I didn't even notice when your mother was seriously ill

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,360
Alright

48
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,159
Alright

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,240
Alright, I understand

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,479
Dad

51
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,199
Don't worry about things between Jiang Yun and me

52
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,680
I'll handle it myself

53
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,360
Good son

54
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,080
Alright

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,159
If this deal goes through

56
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,879
We'll be set for three to five years

57
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,120
Those two are imperial merchants from the Lin and Huang families

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,879
That's right

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,360
Looks like this business with Xiao Ning

60
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,120
won't be easy to negotiate

61
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,439
Miss Han, you can't go in.

62
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,360
Our master isn't here.

63
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,639
Young Master Xiao.

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,960
We haven't been able to invite you over these days.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,759
So I had to come here myself.

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Miss Han, what do you mean by this?

67
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,840
Our young master truly is busy.

68
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,439
There's no need for us to pretend anymore.

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,879
Just say what you want directly.

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,120
You used the Wine Immortal Gathering to set me up badly.

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,080
Shouldn't you take responsibility for that?

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,800
Wait a moment.

73
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,000
You agreed to the Wine Immortal Gathering.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
You can't blame me for it.

75
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,199
Besides, back then your Han family

76
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,560
forcefully took over my tea house,

77
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,079
and you didn't say you'd take responsibility either.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,519
That's business—one must accept the outcome of a bet.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,079
But Lingluo would like to remind you of one thing, Young Master.

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,879
My Han family is the top clan in Dajing.

81
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,519
If you really keep making a scene like this,

82
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,399
I'm afraid

83
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,920
it won't be good for you.

84
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,160
It's not like this is the first time you've caught me.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,680
If you have any other tricks, just use them.

86
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,439
Young Master Xiao, you really won't be swayed by anything.

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,120
Then I truly have no other options.

88
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,720
I only ask you,

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
to give my Han family restaurant a way to survive.

90
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,759
What do you want to do?

91
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,120
As long as you agree to supply us,

92
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,839
my Han family is willing to offer

93
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,879
a price thirty percent higher than the market rate

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
to purchase Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine.

95
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,959
I sell both new wines for only five taels per jug

96
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,600
just to completely eliminate Xiaoyao Spring.

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,399
If I sell the wine to you,

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,240
wouldn't I just be shooting myself in the foot?

99
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,879
The pricing of Xiaoyao Spring

100
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,160
is also part of your plan, isn't it?

101
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
Since you're targeting us so deliberately,

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,079
why not just state your demands directly?

103
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
I want the brewing license.

104
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,519
I won't agree to any other terms.

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,360
The brewing license?

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,439
Could it be that from the very beginning,

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,040
you were after this license

108
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,519
and set up everything step by step?

109
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,879
I'm not like your Han family,

110
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,600
I don't have that much scheming in me.

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,399
I just don't want to be controlled by others.

112
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,360
I just want to do business peacefully.

113
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,600
Is that really so?

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
Is there any need for me to lie to you?

115
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,839
With my business skills,

116
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,079
do you think that besides selling wine,

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,959
I can't find another way to make money?

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,399
That's true.

119
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,680
Young Master Xiao, whether it's poetry gatherings, wine parties,

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
or running a tea house,

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,279
I admire you for all of them.

122
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,040
But this brewing license is a serious matter.

123
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,399
My master will have to agree to it personally.

124
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,160
There's no rush.

125
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Since Young Master Xiao has spoken so sincerely,

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,120
then I, Ling Luo, will also speak honestly.

127
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,399
Please go ahead.

128
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,399
I hope that in future business dealings,

129
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,720
I can compete with Young Master Xiao

130
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,279
in a fair and open contest.

131
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,360
That suits me perfectly.

132
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,279
That Xiao Ning really doesn't know what's good for him.

133
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,879
He's deliberately humiliating our Han family.

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,399
Master.

135
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,160
Now, Xiao Ning has already

136
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,399
taken the lead in the wine business.

137
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,519
Behind him,

138
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,399
he also has the support of His Majesty and the Princess.

139
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,240
If we continue to oppose him,

140
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,439
I'm afraid we'll end up losing everything.

141
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,160
You are in charge of all the Han family's business affairs.

142
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,199
But not only have you been outmaneuvered by Xiao Ning

143
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,000
in both the tea and restaurant businesses,

144
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,559
now you even dare to speak up for him.

145
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,000
Ling Luo has no other intentions besides managing business.

146
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,039
Master.

147
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,399
If we want to save the Han family's business now,

148
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,799
cooperating with Xiao Ning is the only way.

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,120
Master, you must face reality.

150
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,799
Don't let your anger cloud your judgment.

151
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,639
Insolence!

152
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
The Han family has a legacy of a hundred years.

153
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,279
We have influence both in and out of the court.

154
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,639
Let alone Xiao Ning,

155
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,480
even His Majesty

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,919
would not dare to move against the Han family lightly.

157
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,559
You defend Xiao Ning so much—

158
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,000
could it be

159
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,600
you've already joined forces with him?

160
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,879
Ling Luo.

161
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
I wouldn't dare.

162
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,919
Xiao Ning is just a pawn.

163
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
If we get rid of him without anyone knowing,

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,600
even if His Majesty finds out,

165
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
he wouldn't dare turn against us so easily.

166
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,639
Master,

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,480
this action—

168
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,240
No need to say more.

169
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,879
You may leave.

170
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,080
Since that's the case,

171
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,279
then it's all or nothing.

172
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,320
Hongzhi has made some progress lately.

173
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,120
Thank you for your praise, Father.

174
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,080
But dealing with Xiao Ning is a minor issue.

175
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,039
We must not act rashly.

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
Contending with His Majesty

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,440
is the real priority right now.

178
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,159
But—

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,159
We can't let new problems arise.

180
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,639
And we mustn't lose sight of the bigger picture over small matters.

181
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,840
Do you understand this principle?

182
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,480
I have my own preparations for the court.

183
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,639
As for business matters,

184
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,320
from now on, all business affairs,

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
will first be reviewed by you.

186
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,679
If you really can't decide,

187
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,799
then report to me.

188
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,360
Yes.

189
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,200
Thank you for your trust, Father.

190
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,039
Congratulations, young master! Congratulations!

191
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
That Yan Lingluo is just a merchant's daughter.

192
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,000
She really thinks a bit of cleverness

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,480
is enough to get the better of me?

194
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,559
Of course, of course.

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,639
Not only does Yan Lingluo dare to talk back to the master,

196
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,399
she's also very close to Xiao Ning.

197
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,039
She brought this on herself.

198
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,519
Keep an eye on her these next few days.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,279
She is not allowed to leave the residence.

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,279
Yes.

201
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,919
Wait a moment.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,120
Find someone from the martial world to cripple Xiao Ning as soon as possible.

203
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,879
But just now, Prime Minister...

204
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,879
What are you afraid of?

205
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,919
Father only said not to take his life.

206
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,519
Isn't that right?

207
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,559
Time to split the loot! Time to split the loot!

208
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:58,759
These

209
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,799
These

210
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,759
And those in the courtyard

211
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,919
are all yours.

212
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Four hundred thousand taels.

213
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,799
In less than half a month of selling Yuxian Wine and Minggong Wine,

214
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,559
we've actually earned this much in dividends.

215
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,679
Of course.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,399
Just stick with me.

217
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,519
You little rich lady,

218
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,080
soon you'll be as rich as a nation.

219
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,480
How dare you!

220
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,799
Your Majesty—

221
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,080
Your Majesty—

222
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,279
Who are you people?

223
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,720
This is Xiao Ning.

224
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,159
He clearly isn't a good person.

225
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,519
My wife and I are the new managers hired by the owner.

226
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,440
Manager Bi.
