1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,799
Su Mingzhuo

2
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,359
How dare you treat the owner of the Tea Pavilion

3
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,159
with such disrespect

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,479
Are you trying to force the Huang and Lin families

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,479
to take action against the Su family?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,719
How did you suddenly

7
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,039
become the owner of the Tea Pavilion?

8
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,079
You must be deceiving everyone

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Sorry to keep you waiting

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,519
Uncle Huang

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,239
Most of your shops are located among restaurants

12
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,840
Let me recommend you a "Naoge Wulong" tea

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,519
It helps with digestion and relieves greasiness

14
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,879
You can't go wrong with it

15
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,959
I'll sign an order for fifty boxes first

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
That's great

17
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,560
That's enough to solve the urgent needs of the Huang family

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,319
You're too kind

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,879
Thank you very much

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,159
Here you go

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,920
Uncle Lin

22
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,640
Your shop is located near clothing and cosmetics stores.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,840
Girls aren't used to strong flavors either.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,359
Then I'll give you twenty boxes of floral tea first.

25
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,560
And twenty boxes of fruit tea.

26
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,640
These should sell much better than salted tea.

27
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,319
Much better is an understatement.

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,879
This is practically giving our Lin family

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,959
a whole new market.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,719
I, Lin, am deeply grateful to you, Master Xiao.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
You're too kind.

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,319
Here you go.

33
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,400
Goodbye.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,239
Goodbye.

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,959
Young Master Xiao

36
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,159
Please pick something for me.

37
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,000
Boss Xu, let me take a look.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
This is yours, take it.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,280
Alright.

40
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,439
This is yours.

41
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,400
Master Xiao, it's my turn.

42
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,759
What about me? What about me?

43
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,520
Don't rush, don't rush.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,919
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

45
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,360
Master Xiao

46
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,199
Could you sell us something?

47
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:30,960
Even a small amount is fine.

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,960
Even just a hundred boxes would do.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
You are...

50
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,560
Your nephew.

51
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,680
This is my granddaughter.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
We're family by marriage.

53
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,719
Xiao Ning.

54
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,560
No, my good son-in-law.

55
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,360
Look at you, how could you...

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Stop rambling, get to the point.

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
Aren't you going to give a report?

58
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,039
No need for unnecessary words.

59
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,400
You know our Su family

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,039
has run into some business difficulties.

61
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,719
So if we could get tea from Nong Cha Pavilion

62
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,000
Young master,

63
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,639
all the prepared tea has already been sold.

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
This... this...

65
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,159
I'm so angry!

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
How dare he make me lose face in front of the clan leader

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,439
and embarrass me so badly.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,639
I think that Xiao Ning did it on purpose.

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
He's clearly the owner of the Tea Pavilion,

70
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,000
yet he doesn't tell us the truth.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,520
He didn't even reserve a spot for our Su family.

72
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,520
How could there be such a malicious son-in-law?

73
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,599
A man should have ambitions far and wide.

74
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,400
To marry well, one must first make a name for himself.

75
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,840
If you want to succeed,

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,919
there's more than just passing the imperial exams.

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
For example,

78
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,280
like opening a milk tea shop or something.

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,800
This poetry gathering is hosted by the Tea Pavilion.

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,520
Young Master Xiao is one of the organizers.

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,120
Of course he has the right to set the topic.

82
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,800
So,

83
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,240
he really is that impressive.

84
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,680
He thinks just because he owns the Tea Pavilion, he's something special.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,520
I don't believe it.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
Can a commoner really go up against an official?

87
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,800
Madam, do you mean...

88
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,040
Yan'er

89
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,399
That Xiao Ning

90
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,920
He eats our food and lives in our house

91
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,800
That tea house of his

92
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,959
only exists because our Su family funded it

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,839
Go and talk to Young Master Wei

94
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,680
Ask him to

95
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,959
help us take back the tea house

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,480
Mother

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,360
Young Master Wei is the son of the Assistant Minister of Revenue

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,759
Dealing with a small tea house like his

99
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
should be a piece of cake

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,199
Be sure to make Xiao Ning

101
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,000
kneel and hand over the tea house to our Su family

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,759
Father, Mother

103
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,959
I don't want to go

104
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,959
I'm not feeling well

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,759
I'll go back and rest first

106
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,000
You

107
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,959
Yan'er

108
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,120
Forget it

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,560
If she won't go, I'll go myself

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,399
The Su family's goods

111
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,720
Prepare some extra and send it to them

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,199
to help them out of their current predicament

113
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,800
Young master

114
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,079
I think those people from the Su family

115
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,319
aren't very nice to you either

116
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,199
We're all under the same roof

117
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,519
If he is unkind, should I be unjust?

118
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,800
By the way

119
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,040
Have you prepared the goods for the Ministry of Revenue?

120
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,560
They're ready

121
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,480
Lord Zhang will come personally to collect them soon

122
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,959
Alright

123
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,319
Young Master Wei

124
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
As long as you help us get the Tea Pavilion this time

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Once we return to the Su residence

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I will definitely marry Yan'er to you

127
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,759
Mother-in-law, rest assured

128
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,399
Where is Xiao Ning?

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,839
Tell him to get out here

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,040
Are you looking for Young Master Xiao?

131
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,079
What's going on?

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,240
How did Young Master Xiao offend them?

133
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,319
Xiao Ning

134
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,720
Wei Yihao

135
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,439
What are you doing?

136
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,319
The Tea Pavilion adulterated the Ministry of Revenue's tea.

137
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,639
This is a search and seizure warrant.

138
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,519
It can't be that serious, right?

139
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,000
The Ministry's tea hasn't even been picked up yet.

140
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,879
That's a ridiculous reason.

141
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,079
Stop making excuses, Xiao Ning.

142
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,000
You even dare to bully our Su family.

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,519
You're finished today.

144
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,160
What are you doing? What are you doing?

145
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,040
Don't touch me.

146
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,519
Don't.

147
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,120
Wei Yihao

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,399
Young master

149
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:40,720
Wait a moment.

150
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,000
Wait.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,319
Young master

152
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Do you dare show me your official document?

153
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,000
Take a good look.

154
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,079
This is the Ministry of Revenue's seal.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,959
The Vice Minister's seal.

156
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,720
Take them away.

157
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:52,800
Wei Yihao

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,160
Wei Yihao

159
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,639
Young master

160
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:53,959
You—

161
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,319
Young master

162
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,160
Young master

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,800
This is what happens when things don't go my way.

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Wei Yihao

165
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,079
Let me remind you,

166
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
forging an official seal is a serious crime.

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,360
You're setting me up.

168
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,600
Nonsense!

169
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,560
I'm doing this for the Ministry of Revenue.

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,879
I'm doing this for the Ministry of Revenue.

171
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
Seize this Tea Pavilion.

172
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,399
Take him back to prison.

173
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,160
Young Master!

174
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,480
Young Master!

175
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Wei Yihao!

176
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
Wei Yihao, are you crazy?

177
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,839
Why did you arrest Young Master Xiao?

178
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,439
What's going on?

179
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,759
Xiao Ning's tea is adulterated.

180
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,000
That's against the law.

181
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,160
Such a crooked merchant

182
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,399
deserves no pity if he dies.

183
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,959
The Tea Pavilion's tea is fake?

184
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,879
No way!

185
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,319
It's so expensive and still fake?

186
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,839
If that's not a crooked merchant, what is?

187
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,279
I'm being framed!

188
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,240
Framed, my foot!

189
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,360
Go shout about being wronged in prison.

190
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,759
But someone like you,

191
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,319
don't even think about getting out for the rest of your life.

192
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,600
So the authorities can just

193
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,480
make things up and bully people with their power?

194
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
Exactly!

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,800
Mother-in-law,

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,519
please

197
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,480
take him away.

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,959
Let's see who dares to cause trouble.

199
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,920
Master Zhang

200
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,560
Why did you barge into the Tea Pavilion and cause a disturbance?

201
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,759
I was worried there might be problems with the Tea Pavilion's operations.

202
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,519
So I wanted to take Xiao Ning to the Ministry of Revenue for questioning.

203
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,680
I wanted to explain the seriousness of the situation to him.

204
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,680
Yes, that's right.

205
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
We have official documents from the Ministry of Revenue.

206
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Master Zhang

207
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,279
How dare you!

208
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,360
You are not an official of the Ministry of Revenue.

209
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
How could you have such official documents?

210
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,240
They were approved by my father.

211
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,159
I saw that my father was quite busy.

212
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,080
So I came here on his behalf.

213
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,639
Yes.

214
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,679
Wei Yihao

215
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,759
Impersonating government officials

216
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,879
What crime does that constitute?

217
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,879
Please forgive me, Master Zhang.

218
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,440
I don't know what's going on either.

219
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,279
Privately using the official seal is a serious crime.

220
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm sure once you arrive at the Court of Justice

221
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,159
you'll understand what's going on.

222
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,039
Please spare me, Master Zhang!

223
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,200
It really was my father's order.

224
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,200
I truly didn't use public office for personal gain.

225
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,360
His father is a vice minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,039
He used his position for personal gain.

227
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,919
Take them all to the Court of Justice for strict investigation.

228
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,000
Tell them

229
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,480
I will personally look into this.

230
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Yes, sir.

231
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
It's over.

232
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,960
Father

233
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,840
It's over.

234
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,279
Sir

235
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,399
I truly didn't know about this Wei official

236
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,559
Wei Yihao forged official documents

237
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,519
Please forgive me, sir

238
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,679
Young Master Xiao, you were startled

239
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,840
Son-in-law, son-in-law

240
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
We are family, after all

241
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,240
Explain things to Lord Zhang

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's not ruin the harmony of our family

243
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,039
Thank you, Lord Zhang, for resolving the situation

244
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,279
Not at all

245
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,759
Young Master Xiao is a pillar of our nation

246
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,320
We failed to protect you

247
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
No

248
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
I've prepared your goods

249
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
Let me show you

250
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,799
Then I'll trouble you, Young Master Xiao

251
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Please

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Please

253
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,080
Everyone, please disperse

254
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,159
Everything is fine now

255
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,879
Let's go, let's go

256
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,919
This Xiao Ning

257
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,159
The person backing him

258
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,799
Is actually the Minister
