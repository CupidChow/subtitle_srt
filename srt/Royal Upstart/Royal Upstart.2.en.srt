1
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,359
Elder sister is exceptionally talented.

2
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,399
This time, she will surely be able to stand out at the Eighth Day Poetry Gathering.

3
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,399
and win the top prize in one fell swoop.

4
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,079
So this is the son-in-law of the Xiao family.

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,840
He idles about in broad daylight.

6
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,520
He really is a good-for-nothing.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Xiao Ning.

8
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,439
Why aren't you back in your room studying?

9
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,400
You should be working towards earning a title.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,239
Stop wandering around outside.

11
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,799
A man should have ambitions far and wide.

12
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,640
If you want to make your family proud, you must become famous.

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,599
If you want to succeed,

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:11,840
there's more than one way besides passing the exams.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,359
There’s more than one path to success.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,480
For example,

17
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,920
like opening a milk tea shop or something.

18
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,680
Don’t compare yourself to the milk tea master.

19
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,519
Without a deep sense of feeling,

20
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,879
you could never make such milk tea.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,760
Someone who can't even read a single word

22
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,040
isn't worthy of drinking this milk tea.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,239
This is where my close friends and I often gather.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
If you come back here again,

25
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,000
please use the side entrance.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,799
But I’m the official son-in-law.

27
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,120
Why should I use the side entrance?

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,319
Do you really think you deserve Xueyan?

29
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,319
The title of the most talented woman in Shangdu?

30
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,760
If you had any self-awareness,

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
you’d know to leave the Su residence on your own.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,680
How do you know

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
that I don’t know how to compose poetry?

34
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,680
You—

35
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,239
Well then, you all

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:53,959
just wait and see.

37
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,760
Just wait and see.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,640
You—

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,760
Sister, look at him.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,719
Leyao.

41
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,280
Don’t argue with him anymore.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,159
Lest you lose your elegance.

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Young Master

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,759
Our tea house has only been open for seven days

45
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,240
and we've already made five thousand taels of silver.

46
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,719
You truly are a business genius.

47
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,960
But the costs...

48
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,840
Young Master

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,919
Why do you still look unsatisfied?

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
How is the recruitment going?

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,719
You mean hiring new staff, right?

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,879
The city has been chaotic lately.

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,080
I'll ask around again in a while.

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,639
The city is chaotic?

55
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,319
What happened?

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Next, please.

57
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,159
Be careful.

58
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,639
Catch it.

59
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,400
Go ahead.

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,960
Take it slow.

61
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,919
Next.

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,319
Jiang Yun

63
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,759
I thought she was

64
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,000
a shrewd and calculating businesswoman.

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,879
Turns out she's a kind-hearted and beautiful young lady.

66
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,680
Alright.

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Here you go.

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,039
Manager Jiang

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,439
Young Master Xiao

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,560
Thank you.

71
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,599
Young Master Xiao

72
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,840
This is Lord Zhang, Minister of Revenue.

73
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,039
Minister of Revenue

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,759
Is this the backer you mentioned?

75
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,680
You could say that.

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,039
Solid.

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,439
Master Zhang

78
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,039
This is Xiao Ning, whom I mentioned to you before.

79
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,199
So, Young Master Xiao

80
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,680
is the renowned owner of the Tea Pavilion.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
My apologies for not recognizing you.

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,000
You flatter me.

83
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,039
Master Zhang, you are too kind.

84
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,719
It's a pity I can't have a long conversation with you today.

85
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,919
I still need to handle the resettlement of the disaster victims.

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
My Tea Pavilion is willing to provide jobs for the victims.

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,520
As long as Master Zhang, in the name of the Ministry of Revenue,

88
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,000
helps promote this for me,

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,080
and grants me a three-year tax exemption,

90
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,039
then, with both fame and profit as incentives,

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
the noble families will surely follow suit.

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,599
Once the noble families join in,

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,919
the small merchants and vendors

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,680
will also, for the sake of tax exemptions,

95
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,199
naturally start hiring the victims as well, won't they?

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,960
Thank you, Young Master Xiao, for this brilliant idea.

97
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,560
May I ask how many victims you are willing to take in?

98
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Then let the Tea Pavilion

99
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,919
take in half of the victims.

100
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,080
Young Master Xiao

101
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,599
There are thousands of refugees in this group.

102
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
With just one tea shop,

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,959
how can we possibly take in so many people?

104
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,560
Come with me to a place and you'll understand.

105
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Young Master Xiao

106
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,560
Didn't you say

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
you wanted to rally shops to take in refugees?

108
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,279
It's barren outside the city.

109
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,879
What kind of business could there be?

110
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
These mountains

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,439
are the business I use to take in refugees.

112
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,519
Are you saying

113
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,120
you want to buy these mountains?

114
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,079
I've already bought them.

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,639
Young Master Xiao

116
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
The tea shop has only just started to improve.

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,399
We should proceed step by step and take things slowly.

118
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,639
How can you be so reckless?

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,959
What use are these barren mountains?

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,839
That's something you don't understand.

121
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,319
This is called strategic foresight.

122
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,279
Simply put, I'll lead the refugees

123
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,879
to plant tea trees all over these mountains.

124
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,240
When the time comes,

125
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,920
we can

126
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,680
take a chance and turn a bicycle into a motorcycle.

127
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,759
Planting tea?

128
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,040
That's a great idea.

129
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,519
It can not only solve the refugees' basic needs,

130
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,279
but also provide them with work.

131
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,439
Teaching someone to fish is better than giving them fish.

132
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,399
Smart.

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
If I can plant tea trees all over these mountains,

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,079
covering them completely,

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
the tea shop's costs

136
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,480
can be reduced by seventy percent,

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
and there will be even bigger business opportunities.

138
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,040
You have another new idea?

139
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,279
You'll know when the time comes.

140
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,959
Young Master Xiao is not only well-versed in the art of business,

141
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,680
but can also offer counsel for the nation.

142
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
He even has far-sighted, long-term plans.

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,959
I truly admire him.

144
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
You flatter me, Lord Zhang.

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
This year's poetry gathering coincides with the spring imperial exams.

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,040
Scholars from all over have gathered in the capital.

147
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,279
It's exceptionally lively.

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,839
Isn't that Young Master Kong Sheng from the Kong family?

149
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,639
I heard he passed the imperial exam at sixteen.

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,199
He truly is talented and handsome.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,920
Not only that,

152
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,439
I see that this year has also attracted

153
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,560
many young gentlemen and ladies from noble families.

154
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,560
I also heard

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,399
the eldest son of the Prime Minister's residence will attend as well.

156
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,279
To participate in the poetry gathering with Miss Su

157
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,720
is truly my honor.

158
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,639
You are too kind, Young Master Wei.

159
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,319
If I could obtain today

160
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,680
a calligraphy piece from Her Highness the Princess,

161
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:25,439
the Wei and Su families would become famous in the capital.

162
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,639
Her Highness's calligraphy?

163
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,120
Then I will do everything I can.

164
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,120
That's right.

165
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,439
Isn't that the good-for-nothing from the Xiao family?

166
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,879
I didn't expect you would actually dare to come.

167
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,120
What's wrong?

168
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,519
Acting like a tagalong.

169
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,279
You followed Xueyan all the way here.

170
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm just attending the poetry gathering on my own.

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
Why do you all have such a big problem with that?

172
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,879
Look!

173
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,519
That's Mr. Qianlin.

174
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,600
It's Mr. Qianlin.

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,639
The person beside him...

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,079
Could that be Young Master Han from the Prime Minister's residence?

177
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,879
Mr. Qianlin.

178
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,639
Young Master Han.

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Is that Han Hongzhi?

180
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
You don't recognize him?

181
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,319
Young Master Han is handsome and has an extraordinary presence.

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,839
I really wish I could enjoy poetry with Young Master Han.

183
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,040
What's going on with those two?

184
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,639
Xiao Ning.

185
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,360
This really isn't a place you should be.

186
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,319
Guards!

187
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
Drag Xiao Ning out for me.

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
So this lowly person doesn't disrupt the poetry gathering.

189
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,000
Everyone wants me to get lost.

190
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,319
Sorry about that.

191
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,680
Without me, today's poetry gathering

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,759
really can't go on.

193
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,079
This poetry gathering is sponsored by Nong Tea Pavilion.

194
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,759
With just you?

195
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,279
Not to mention Mr. Qianlin,

196
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,360
and Young Master Han from the Prime Minister's residence overseeing things.

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,519
Who do you think you are?

198
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,839
Who is making all this noise?

199
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,839
A poetry gathering is a place of elegance.

200
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,120
How improper to be so noisy.

201
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,079
Lord Zhang.

202
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,959
It's all this son-in-law causing trouble.

203
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,560
Please, my lord, have him thrown out.

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,279
So the poetry gathering can start sooner.

205
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,759
Wei, my worthy nephew, please watch your words.

206
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,000
M-My lord...

207
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,439
What... what does this mean?

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,560
Young Master Xiao.

209
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,800
I didn't expect

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,680
that Lord Zhang would be the chief judge of this poetry gathering.

211
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,120
Miss Jiang said that this poetry gathering

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,920
is related to the major relief efforts.

213
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,759
She specifically asked me to keep an eye on things.

214
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,560
Could it be that this poetry gathering

215
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,600
is also related to you, Young Master Xiao?

216
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,120
This is not the place to talk.

217
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,720
Young Master Xiao, please come upstairs to discuss in detail.

218
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,399
Let's go.

219
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,799
Why did Xiao Ning leave with Lord Zhang?

220
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,480
How does he know Lord Zhang?

221
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,600
To be honest,

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
after today,

223
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,799
the business at the Tea Pavilion will increase tenfold.

224
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,200
Tenfold?

225
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,000
I truly never expected that.

226
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,480
A poetry gathering could actually affect the shop's business.

227
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,720
Young Master Xiao, please do share your wisdom.

228
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,720
Lord Zhang.

229
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,559
It wouldn't be any fun if I told you now.

230
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,639
You'll see for yourself in a moment.

231
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,279
Then I must keep my eyes wide open.

232
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,399
If I can learn even a little,

233
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,639
I too can do something for the people of our land.

234
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,200
Bring them fortune and honor.

235
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
Um, Lord Zhang,

236
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,919
I have one more thing I'd like to ask you.

237
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,879
Young Master Xiao, please feel free to ask.

238
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,480
Who exactly is Jiang Yun?

239
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
Why was she able to distribute relief with you?

240
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,200
And even invite you, the Minister of Revenue,

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,039
to be a judge at the poetry gathering?

242
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,639
Miss Jiang once did me a great favor.

243
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
So you were just returning a favor.

244
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,840
I thought she was some kind of princess.

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,799
Excellent tea.

246
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,919
Lord Zhang.

247
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,360
Lord Zhang.

248
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,159
Mister Qianlin.

249
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,759
Everyone, please have a seat.

250
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,600
Please.

251
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,799
What are you doing?

252
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,639
Next to His Highness's calligraphy,

253
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,080
how could you possibly stand there?

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Get down.

255
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,279
Master Zhang.

256
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,639
It seems someone doesn't want me to announce the topic.

257
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,759
All of you, keep quiet.

258
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,080
If anyone dares to interrupt Young Master Xiao today,

259
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,399
I'll hold them accountable.

260
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,759
Xiao Ning will announce the topic.

261
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,799
Master Zhang, are you mistaken?

262
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,639
He's just a

263
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,279
good-for-nothing son-in-law who lives in the kitchen.

264
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,840
Can he really handle something this important?

265
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,960
This poetry gathering is organized by the Tea Pavilion.

266
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,679
Young Master Xiao is one of the organizers.

267
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,360
Of course he has the right to announce the topic.

268
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,639
An organizer?

269
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,600
What does Xiao Ning have to do with the Tea Pavilion?
