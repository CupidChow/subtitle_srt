1
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,200
This cup is as clear and pure as water.

2
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,960
It brings peace to one's heart.

3
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,640
It stirs no waves within.

4
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,240
Just like how I feel about you.

5
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,520
Young Master Xiao, please compose a poem with this feeling.

6
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,960
Pure and clear as water.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
Xueyan is telling everyone

8
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,439
that you, Xiao Ning, are not worthy of her.

9
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,480
Clouds surge in my chest.

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
My eyes follow the returning birds.

11
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,760
I shall climb to the summit.

12
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,959
And see all other mountains beneath me.

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,799
What a great poem! What a great poem!

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,040
Du Fu's "Gazing at the Mountain."

15
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,079
Listen to this.

16
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,920
How profound, broad, concise, and deep it is.

17
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,239
Wonderful.

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Truly wonderful.

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,560
In just twenty words,

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,599
it reveals the vastness of the world.

21
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,199
Especially the meaning of climbing high and seeing far.

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,199
It is even more meaningful.

23
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,639
This is a masterpiece.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Though infamous far and wide,

25
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,719
it still has the ambition to reach the sky.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,759
This Xiao Ning is quite interesting.

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Although this poem is good,

28
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,120
it does not reflect what I truly feel.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,280
This poem was not written to please you.

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,319
To stand atop the highest peak,

31
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,240
and see all other mountains appear small.

32
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,520
This is to

33
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,439
cast off everyone's impression of me as wasteful,

34
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,400
to take lightly my status as a son-in-law,

35
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,479
and even more, to show my ambition to soar to the skies.

36
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,879
To stand atop the highest peak,

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,240
and see all other mountains appear small.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Could it be

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,960
that Xiao Ning truly has such lofty aspirations?

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,599
A fine poem.

41
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,400
A truly fine poem.

42
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,639
Excellent.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,039
Young Master Xiao is truly a great talent.

44
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,120
What a pity.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,439
Such a pity.

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,840
Young Master Han, what do you mean by this?

47
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,479
Do you have another interpretation

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,280
of Young Master Xiao's poem?

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,039
It's not that I doubt Young Master Xiao's poem,

50
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,879
but rather, I question his character.

51
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,159
This is because

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,080
after hearing Young Master Xiao's poem,

53
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm sure everyone here believes

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,400
he is a most refined person.

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,159
But it's a pity,

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,000
as everyone knows that tea must be steeped and boiled,

57
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,000
and the ratio of tea to salt

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,479
must also be strictly observed.

59
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,599
The insights gained from brewing tea

60
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,520
are a matter of cultivation for us scholars and poets.

61
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,199
It is a way to cultivate oneself.

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
But as Young Master Xiao just said,

63
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,879
he simply poured hot water into a cup.

64
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
That is truly lacking in refinement.

65
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,120
But it is not without reason.

66
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,920
Young Master Han is right.

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,279
I think this Xiao Ning is just pretending to be refined.

68
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,079
In reality, he's just an unremarkable person.

69
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,040
What Young Master Han said just now was one-sided.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,959
Making tea is simply for everyone's convenience.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,879
How do you know

72
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,360
that what my Tea Pavilion values

73
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,240
isn't the art of tea?

74
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,279
What is he trying to do now?

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
The essence of the tea ceremony

76
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,560
is not about how complicated the process is.

77
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,439
It's about, during the process of tasting tea,

78
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,839
enjoying peace and calming the mind.

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,920
Through flavors that are sweet or bitter,

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,040
one experiences the many flavors of life.

81
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,839
Whether missing home or someone dear,

82
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,199
it all fits.

83
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,800
Let us try new tea with fresh fire.

84
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,040
Enjoy poetry and wine while we are young.

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,279
How come I never heard before

86
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,839
that the young master of the Xiao family is so handsome and elegant,

87
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,639
with such graceful manners,

88
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,959
and great ambition in his heart?

89
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,639
He truly makes people admire him.

90
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
He really is the perfect gentleman.

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,279
It smells so good.

92
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,199
Tasting it this way, the tea's aroma becomes even richer.

93
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,279
The lingering sweetness is truly beyond words.

94
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Young Master Xiao,

95
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,959
Today, I have truly broadened my horizons.

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Young Master Xiao is not only well-versed in poetry and literature,

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,199
but also has such deep insight into the art of tea.

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
What a wonderful saying:

99
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,519
"Let us try new tea with fresh fire,"

100
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,920
"and enjoy poetry and wine while we are young."

101
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,519
I have truly benefited greatly.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,079
You flatter me, elder.

103
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,480
To be honest,

104
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,279
because of my previous work

105
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,000
and experiences,

106
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
I have gained some understanding of the tea ceremony.

107
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
The so-called art of tea

108
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
is nothing more than

109
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,600
cultivating virtue through simplicity and frugality,

110
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,160
pursuing beauty, truth, health, and joy,

111
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,160
living with harmony and sincerity,

112
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,000
and treating others with respect and kindness.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
Treating others with respect and kindness.

114
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,800
In my humble opinion,

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,040
brewing tea is a poetic form of self-cultivation.

116
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,000
This is true insight into the art of tea.

117
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,800
It seems Young Master Xiao understands tea even better than Young Master Han.

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,839
Yes, indeed.

119
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,439
Young Master Xiao's approach to tea truly resonates with me.

120
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,279
I'll take ten jin each of this "Xiaohunxiang" and "Qingruxu" teas.

121
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,800
Give me ten jin of each.

122
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,279
I also want "Meizhenkangle" tea.

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,720
I want twenty jin of each type of tea for brewing.

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,600
I want some too! Me too!

125
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,879
Don't rush, don't rush.

126
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,360
Everyone, please don't rush.

127
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
On another day, at the Tea Pavilion,

128
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,559
everything will be properly prepared for all of you.

129
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,039
Don't worry, everyone.

130
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,399
After today

131
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,960
Nongcha Pavilion will surely become famous throughout the land

132
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,799
Once the poetry gathering is over

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
let's go meet the owner of Nongcha Pavilion

134
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,519
Auntie

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,919
It's just a small tea business

136
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,879
There's no need for you to handle it personally

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Such a small Nongcha Pavilion

138
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,600
can cause such a big stir

139
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,480
The owner of this Nongcha Pavilion

140
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,200
must not be an ordinary person

141
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,960
Just do as I told you

142
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,759
Yes

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,480
Some flashy little tricks

144
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,240
barely catch the attention of my Prime Minister's residence

145
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,960
I can give you a chance

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,200
If you can

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,279
give me the tea-making method of Nongcha Pavilion

148
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,360
No, not interested

149
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,159
Xiao Ning

150
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,480
Don't be so rude to Young Master Han

151
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,840
Don't even think about it

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,639
There's nothing to discuss

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,600
Nothing to discuss, nothing to discuss

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,919
You

155
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,919
Lord Zhang, Mr. Chen

156
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,960
Let's move to a private room to continue our conversation

157
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,840
Alright

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,799
Please

159
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,440
After you, Lord Zhang

160
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,120
Please

161
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,320
Sorry, Young Master Han

162
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,919
He

163
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,519
It's fine

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,240
There's no need for such words between us

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,639
Having to be with people like that

166
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,080
is truly unfair to you

167
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,559
Alright.

168
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,120
What a wonderful way to enjoy poetry and wine while we're young.

169
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,840
This Xiao Ning is not only full of talent,

170
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,799
but also understands the art of tea so deeply at such a young age.

171
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
That's truly rare.

172
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,559
Your Majesty, there is something else you may not know.

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,799
The purpose of holding this poetry gathering

174
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,240
was actually for Young Master Xiao to introduce this new tea.

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,759
Now, all over the realm, people recite poetry

176
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,000
while tasting tea.

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,320
The tea from the Tea Pavilion

178
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,240
is hard to buy, no matter how wealthy you are.

179
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Young Master Xiao's methods are truly impressive.

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,919
This Xiao Ning also knows well how to spread the word.

181
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,000
Previously,

182
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
the major families and merchants

183
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
worked closely with the Ministry of Revenue

184
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,720
to aid disaster victims.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,840
That idea also came from him.

186
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,000
Young Master Xiao even took in disaster victims himself

187
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
and made it widely known.

188
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,799
He forced the major families to step in and provide relief.

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
This allowed our Ministry of Revenue

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,639
to save nearly seventy percent on disaster relief compared to before.

191
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,519
He involved himself personally in the matter.

192
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,879
This young man truly has some wisdom.

193
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,360
Your Majesty,

194
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,840
I humbly request a favor.

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
What are you doing, my loyal subject?

196
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,320
Speak freely.

197
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,840
Xiao Ning is a genius in commerce.

198
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
I am ashamed to be inferior.

199
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,600
Therefore, I boldly ask Your Majesty

200
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,799
to transfer Xiao Ning to the Ministry of Revenue.

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
Let him enter officialdom as a commoner.

202
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,039
There is no precedent for this in our dynasty.

203
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,840
Your Majesty,

204
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
Recognizing and making good use of talent

205
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,120
is the foundation of long-lasting peace and stability.

206
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,919
I am not a stubborn or old-fashioned ruler.

207
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,080
Have him come to see me.

208
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,679
If he is truly talented,

209
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,039
I will certainly put him in an important position.

210
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,360
Your Majesty is wise.

211
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,399
I will go and invite Xiao Ning right away.

212
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,320
I believe Lord Zhang's proposal is inappropriate.

213
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,919
Greetings to Father Emperor.

214
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,159
Yun'er, what do you mean?

215
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,080
Xiao Ning is carefree by nature.

216
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,840
He does things unconventionally.

217
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,559
I think the Ministry of Revenue is too rigid.

218
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,799
It's not suitable for Xiao Ning to fully display his talents.

219
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,759
If Xiao Ning serves in the Ministry of Revenue,

220
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,600
he will only be able to increase tax revenue slightly each year.

221
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,120
But, Father Emperor,

222
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,600
I hold fifty percent of Xiao Ning's business.

223
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,600
All the income goes to the royal treasury.

224
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,919
If we support Xiao Ning's growth,

225
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,120
then the royal treasury

226
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,960
will surely become abundant within a year.

227
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,240
Wouldn't it be faster to then support the national treasury?

228
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,200
This...

229
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,279
So the urgent matter is to get Father Emperor's approval

230
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
to allow all royal shops

231
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,440
to support Xiao Ning.

232
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
Let the Tea Pavilion open branches throughout the entire realm.

233
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,399
When does it open?

234
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,440
This Tea Pavilion has introduced a new tea brewing method.

235
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,360
It also received a calligraphy piece from His Highness.

236
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,480
It has already become a place admired by scholars everywhere.

237
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,879
Auntie

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,120
No matter how famous the Tea Pavilion is,

239
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,279
it's still just a tea shop.

240
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,279
As long as you take action,

241
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
it will soon become

242
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,879
a property of our Han family.

243
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,279
Let's hope so.
