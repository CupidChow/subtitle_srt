1
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:42,679
So many people.

2
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,280
What time is it already?

3
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,560
My legs are going numb from standing.

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,600
Me too.

5
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,200
My young lady is taking the Imperial Academy exam,

6
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,439
so she had me come early before dawn to buy tea.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,759
She said she needs Qing Ruxu tea

8
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,119
to clear her mind.

9
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,840
Can you believe it?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,920
They're opening! They're opening!

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,880
Don't rush, don't rush.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,600
Everyone, please wait a moment.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,719
I'll take five jin of Five-Colored Beauty.

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,039
And ten jin of Luo Qiuxian.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,000
I was here first!

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,280
I want fifteen jin of Hongchen Dream and Qing Ruxu.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,879
Everyone, everyone, please!

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,680
Everyone.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,359
There is a limited amount of tea today.

20
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,400
Only ten jin.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,480
Please, take your time.

22
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,159
Take your time.

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,799
Make way, make way!

24
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,159
No, I want it all!

25
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,400
Don't rush, don't rush.

26
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,159
I was here first!

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,920
Ten jin is way too little.

28
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,680
I am from the imperial merchant Lin family.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,079
We have a business deal worth over two thousand taels

30
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,599
to discuss with your boss.

31
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,359
Our Han family is willing to offer two thousand taels of silver

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,560
just to meet the owner of the Tea Pavilion.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Two thousand taels just for a meeting?

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,480
The Han family truly is the top family in Dajing.

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,719
Even the Han family is getting involved.

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,719
Looks like we have no chance now.

37
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,439
This...

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,480
I can't make the decision on this.

39
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,799
I'll go ask for instructions first.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
Sorry, everyone, please wait a moment.

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,280
Young Master

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,080
Young Master

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
A lot of guests have indeed arrived outside.

44
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,840
I told them everything as you instructed.

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,240
But some of them not only want to buy tea,

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
they also want to discuss business with you.

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,800
As expected.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Dabai

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,039
Just focus on selling tea.

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
The rest has nothing to do with us.

51
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,479
But people from the Han family have come too.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,800
They even brought two thousand taels of silver.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,879
They want to meet you in person.

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
What’s so special about the Han family?

55
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,159
Aren’t they all just trying to take over my tea house?

56
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,759
They’re no different from other merchants.

57
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
You really do have great ambition.

58
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,759
You even ignore the Han family’s offer.

59
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,120
You don’t take it seriously at all.

60
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,439
Jiang Yun

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,000
It’s settled.

62
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,759
But they don’t trust me.

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,840
How could that be?

64
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,439
You’re not like those outsiders who want to take advantage.

65
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,240
You’re different.

66
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,120
How much?

67
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,400
There are hundreds of royal shops across the entire region.

68
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,639
Do you know what status my Han family holds?

69
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,479
How could a small tea house like yours

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,439
afford to be negligent?

71
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,120
I’m truly sorry.

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,599
Our young master

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,759
does have important matters to attend to.

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,439
Sorry, sorry.

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,319
Now that he's gone, I want to—

76
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,680
I want to, I want to—

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Don't rush, don't rush. Everyone, calm down.

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,759
Hundreds of royal shops.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,080
How did you manage that?

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,719
My father helped me with it.

81
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,840
Who's your father?

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,560
That's a secret.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,800
It's related to Dajing's security.

84
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,919
Confidential personnel.

85
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
There's something I don't understand.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
The tea brewed at Nung Tea Pavilion—

87
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,199
has already spread through the Eighth Poetry Gathering

88
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,400
and become known throughout all of Dajing.

89
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,360
The idea of drinking tea and reciting good poetry

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,479
has deeply taken root in people's hearts.

91
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
So that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants across Dajing

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,039
are all eager to buy it.

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,759
But why do you

94
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,800
only sell ten jin to the public each day?

95
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,599
Wouldn't that

96
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,400
be wasting the profits you could make?

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
You don't get it, do you?

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,520
Other tea shops

99
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,280
always try to sell quickly for a good price after becoming famous.

100
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,919
They all want to cash in fast.

101
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,560
But Nung Tea Pavilion

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,759
can actually resist such temptation.

103
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,199
It seems they have bigger plans.

104
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
This is called "hunger marketing."

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,879
Hunger marketing?

106
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,879
See, so many people want to buy it but can't.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Those who really want to drink it

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,959
will find other ways to get it, won't they?

109
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,240
Of course, we'll raise the price for upgrades.

110
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,839
You mean,

111
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,639
once our branch stores open,

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
and Tea Pavilion is all over the region,

113
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
that's when the real profits come in.

114
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
At that time, we just need to

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
raise the price by about twenty percent.

116
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,639
We can't make it so regular people can't afford tea.

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,120
Then we'll divide the tea

118
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,759
into high, medium, and low grades.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,759
So everyone can benefit.

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
Young Master Xiao, you are truly kind.

121
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,600
Young Master,

122
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,839
I'm getting more and more interested in him.

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,480
So next,

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
since we can't meet,

125
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,959
let's try inviting him another way.

126
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,399
A gentleman makes money the right way.

127
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,480
But you,

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,279
helped me solve the supply issue.

129
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,959
That's how we got rich overnight.

130
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,279
If you don't let me down,

131
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,439
I won't let you down either.

132
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,800
Alright.

133
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,600
Miss Jiang,

134
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,319
you're truly my lucky star.

135
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,759
Young Master Xiao, let go.

136
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,079
Again?

137
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,879
If I don't hit you harder,

138
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,120
you'll never learn your lesson.

139
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,480
I got too excited, way too excited.

140
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,240
Sorry about that.

141
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,600
You're my top partner.

142
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,160
Young Master Xiao is solving the people's problems in the region.

143
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
As one of the owners of Tea Pavilion,

144
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,240
doing what I can

145
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,319
is only right.

146
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I have something to do, so I'll go first.

147
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,199
You're leaving already?

148
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,120
I haven't finished talking yet.

149
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,199
I gave you three years.

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,399
The Su family's salt tea business

151
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,879
and you let it end up like this.

152
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,639
Only ten jin sold in seven days.

153
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,839
Patriarch.

154
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,639
It's mainly because of the milk tea from Nongcha Pavilion.

155
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
Our salt tea business

156
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,639
has indeed been affected.

157
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,879
You make it sound easy.

158
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,519
Is it just "some" impact?

159
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,879
This concerns whether the Su family next year

160
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,199
can remain among the top three imperial merchants.

161
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,319
Patriarch.

162
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,040
I will go and ask Young Master Wei.

163
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,920
His father is the Assistant Minister of Revenue.

164
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,399
I'm willing to bring generous gifts to request a meeting.

165
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,319
Ask him to grant the salt tea trading rights of the three southern Su prefectures

166
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,759
all to the Su family.

167
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,720
We agreed to meet at Shen hour.

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,759
Why the unexplained delay?

169
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,160
Let me have a sip of water first.

170
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,759
What about the tea attendants you asked for before?

171
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
They've all been hired.

172
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,839
With so many shops,

173
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,759
how can we get them all running?

174
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,639
Young Master Xiao.

175
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,160
Have you already come up with a plan?

176
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,439
Of course.

177
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,959
Great.

178
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,160
Reliable.

179
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,199
Why don't we make an agreement?

180
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,560
What kind of agreement?

181
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,319
We keep calling each other "Young Master Xiao" and "Miss Jiang,"

182
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
which sounds distant and troublesome.

183
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,680
Why don't we just use each other's names?

184
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,839
Xiao Ning.

185
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,199
Jiang Yun.

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,680
Xiao Ning

187
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
There's something I don't understand.

188
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
I heard you've already married.

189
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,000
Why have you never mentioned your wife?

190
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,399
Jiang Yun, you don't have to spare my feelings.

191
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,480
I'm a live-in son-in-law.

192
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,840
Even as a live-in son-in-law, a couple can still get along.

193
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,879
But the Su family doesn't think much of me.

194
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm just a bankrupt Xiao family's son-in-law to them.

195
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
If I weren't worried about making things hard for my father,

196
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,720
I would have moved out of the Su family long ago.

197
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you all know

198
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,639
what's most important in the art of tea?

199
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,559
Is it the tea-making skills?

200
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,480
Wrong.

201
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,720
Is it the quality of the tea?

202
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,159
Wrong.

203
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
I know!

204
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,320
It must be the tea philosophy that Young Master Xiao often talks about.

205
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,759
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

206
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,799
It's beauty.

207
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,480
In the service industry,

208
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,919
the most important thing

209
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,879
is to make the guests feel beauty.

210
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,679
The tea tastes good, the people look good,

211
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,320
and the manner is elegant and graceful.

212
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,279
Only these can let the guests

213
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
enjoy themselves during the tea tasting.

214
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,879
and feel happy.

215
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,279
Don't just stand there like wooden dolls.

216
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,200
You are the first group of tea ladies

217
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
at my Tea Pavilion.

218
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm counting on you

219
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,440
to go all over the country

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,679
and train students for me.

221
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Alright, alright.

222
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,399
Just follow my lead and learn.

223
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,320
Come on.

224
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,120
Chin up.

225
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,440
Chest out.

226
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Look straight ahead.

227
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Give a flirty glance.

228
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,080
Xiao Ning.

229
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,480
Slow down.

230
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,159
That was a bit too rough.

231
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,840
Why are you still buying so much salt tea?

232
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,039
Didn't you say before

233
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,559
that we'd lose money selling salt tea?

234
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,960
Look at these.

235
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,159
It's true that salt tea in Shangdu

236
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,600
is heavily affected by Nong Tea Pavilion.

237
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,879
But Young Master Wei helped us

238
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,840
get the business rights for the three counties in southern Su.

239
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
Many people from the three southern Su counties are placing orders.

240
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,559
What you see here

241
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,080
is just a small part

242
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,799
of the salt tea stockpiled by our Su family.

243
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
Alright, alright.

244
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,879
I've said everything I could, good or bad.

245
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,200
You decide for yourself.

246
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,840
This last batch of tea

247
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,320
is finally well supplied.

248
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,559
Now, all the branches across the entire region have opened.

249
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,480
The tea from Nong Tea Pavilion on the market

250
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,840
has, thanks to your hunger marketing,

251
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,639
already increased tenfold in price.

252
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,559
It's all because

253
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,600
the wealthy and powerful families have driven up the price.

254
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,639
After seven days, when sales open across the region,

255
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,799
we'll monopolize this industry

256
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,240
and those bloodsucking families

257
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,600
won't be able to profit anymore.

258
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,879
Now, Nong Tea Pavilion has finally achieved some success.

259
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,480
I can finally give Father

260
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,639
a big surprise.

261
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,519
Come on.

262
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,799
Go move the ancestral hall on the west side for me.

263
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,759
Ruin the feng shui of this place.

264
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,320
Yes, sir.

265
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,960
Nobody move.

266
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,840
Who are you, sir?

267
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,080
Why are you tearing down our house for no reason?

268
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,919
Isn't this the third son's family?

269
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,879
The son-in-law who married into the Su family, right?

270
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,759
What,

271
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
Did they kick you out and send you back?

272
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:19,720
Dad.

273
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,919
Dad.

274
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,039
Stop shouting.

275
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,639
Xiao Hetai already sold this house to me a long time ago.

276
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,879
If you're looking for your dad, why are you here?

277
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,320
Go to the north of the city.

278
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,120
He's in that thatched hut.

279
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Go take a good look.

280
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,960
What are you standing around for?

281
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,759
Smash it for me!

282
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,679
Yes.

283
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,519
Sir.

284
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
This is rice soup I traded for.

285
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,799
Drink it while it's hot.
