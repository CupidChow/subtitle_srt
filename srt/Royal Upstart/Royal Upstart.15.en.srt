1
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,479
You... you...

2
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,200
Mother.

3
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,079
Miss Han.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,600
Although the Su family can't compare to the Han family's immense power,

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,600
we are not to be bullied by others.

6
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,880
I must ask for an explanation today.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
Miss Su, you have quite a temper.

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,400
The Su family is overstepping their bounds.

9
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,799
You can't even tell who is the master here.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
Shouldn't you be taught a lesson?

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,159
What a perfect example of punishing one to warn others.

12
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,640
This is a warning to me.

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,480
Young lady

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,760
After all, the Su family has already sided with me.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,319
Show me some respect.

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,760
Sun Hongyan

17
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,920
You were the one who had someone dilute the wine, weren't you?

18
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,319
Diluting the wine

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,000
How could it possibly be me?

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,200
My staff in the backyard of Wangjiang Tower

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,319
all saw it.

22
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,599
They also heard it.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
And you still want to argue?

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,439
Mother, what's going on?

25
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,920
About the fake wine

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,760
This involves tens of thousands of taels of silver.

27
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,000
Your Su family should take full responsibility for this.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,439
What?

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,239
Tens of thousands of taels?

30
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,280
Tens of thousands of taels?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Dear son-in-law

32
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,159
About diluting the wine

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,000
It was Xiao Ning who told me to do it.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
He said we could make a lot of money this way.

35
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,360
You should explain this properly to Miss Han.

36
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,199
Father has already entrusted this matter to the young lady.

37
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,360
She has full authority to handle it.

38
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,240
I can't help either.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,599
This... this...

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,639
Xiao Ning

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,439
You are the one who caused this trouble.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,800
Why won't you face it?

43
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,360
You really are mother and daughter.

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,199
If you don't want to pay, just say so.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,960
Do you really think I'm that easy to push around?

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,039
Setting aside the matter of the wine for now

47
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,360
whether or not it was done by Mother

48
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,840
since you are the wine seller at Wangjiang Tower

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,039
you should make sure the wine meets the standards.

50
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,319
You can't avoid responsibility for this.

51
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,159
That's right.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,719
I have nothing to say to you.

53
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,159
You—

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
What kind of attitude is that?

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,199
Miss Han,

56
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,280
You see, you get to keep the money you earn,

57
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,719
but if something goes wrong, I have to take responsibility.

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,360
Doing business with you is just too difficult.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
I won't be making this wine anymore.

60
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,319
Young Master Xiao, please wait.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,360
All of you, listen carefully.

62
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,919
Young Master Xiao is not a servant of my Wangjiang Pavilion,

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,120
but a great contributor to the Han family.

64
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,800
I will not allow anyone to tarnish his reputation.

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
Is that clear to everyone?

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Yes.

67
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
Miss Han, you are truly reasonable.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,400
How you deal with the Su family is none of my business.

69
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,439
I'm going to bed.

70
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,400
Young Master,

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,520
Lingluo still has important matters to discuss.

72
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,599
There's still more?

73
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,639
Madam Su,

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,919
I don't wish to report this to the authorities.

75
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,319
If this gets out of hand, it will only harm our relationship.

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,599
But as for the compensation,

77
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,400
please send it to the Han residence as soon as possible.

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Young Master,

79
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,280
Let's go.

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,599
Hongzhi

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,040
Xueyan, is there anything else?

82
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,360
Father has found out about the Wangjiang Restaurant incident.

83
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
He was furious.

84
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll take my leave and head back first.

85
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,680
This...

86
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,279
Good son-in-law,

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
how did this matter

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,759
even reach the Prime Minister?

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,519
Go back and explain things properly to the Prime Minister.

90
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,560
Otherwise, our Su family will really be finished.

91
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,800
The restaurant business is the foundation of our Han family.

92
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,839
You've caused such trouble.

93
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,560
Even I can't help you.

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Hongzhi

95
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,240
Mother

96
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,160
Mother was momentarily confused and made a mistake.

97
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,240
Miss Han has already been hit.

98
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,839
Our Su family has lost face as well.

99
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,240
This debt of tens of thousands of taels of silver

100
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,199
is truly a huge burden for the Su family.

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,879
We ask the Han family

102
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,480
to show the Su family a way out.

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,959
Yes, son-in-law,

104
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,079
whatever the Prime Minister wants us to do,

105
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,879
we'll do it.

106
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,240
Just please don't make us pay for the losses.

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,959
Well...

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
Actually, I have a solution that benefits both sides.

109
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,959
Please tell us, son-in-law.

110
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,319
Do you still control the salt and tea trade routes?

111
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,759
Yes.

112
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,240
But the salt and tea routes

113
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,680
have long been blocked by the Nong Tea Pavilion.

114
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,040
We haven't made any profit for days.

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
Then why not turn the salt and tea routes

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
into channels for selling wine?

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,240
That way, you can not only pay off your debts,

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,439
but might even make a big profit.

119
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,600
Son-in-law is right.

120
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Now that this Xiaoyao Spring is so popular,

121
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,680
as long as our Su family makes use

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,439
of our imperial merchant channel advantages,

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
and sells this wine outside of Shangdu,

124
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,879
we're sure to make a fortune.

125
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,800
As for the shares,

126
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,800
Xueyan, don't worry.

127
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,120
With Xiaoyao Spring being so profitable,

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
Mother will definitely have Xiao Ning increase production.

129
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,000
By then, you can have as many shares as you want.

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,199
In the end,

131
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,639
we're still family.

132
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,319
Son-in-law is right.

133
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,759
We are family, after all.

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
Young Master Xiao, have some tea to refresh yourself.

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,800
We lost tens of thousands of taels of silver for nothing.

136
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Miss Han

137
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Are you planning to end our partnership?

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,800
Quite the opposite.

139
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,000
On the contrary, I hope you

140
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,319
can provide more Xiaoyao Spring.

141
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
Why is that?

142
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,959
Let me be honest with you.

143
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,680
Selling Xiaoyao Spring in Shangdu

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,360
was just a test for me.

145
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,439
Now it seems

146
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,399
this wine

147
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,399
is truly in high demand.

148
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,439
Finally aiming for something bigger.

149
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,199
Of course.

150
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,480
Anything produced by me, Xiao Ning, is guaranteed to be top quality.

151
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,399
Young Master Xiao, you are impressive.

152
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,759
My next step is to

153
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,639
sell this wine through all the major channels in the region.

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,600
If you can deliver on time,

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,399
my Han family is willing to give up another half percent of the profit.

156
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,399
Supplying to all the major sales channels in the region

157
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,959
That half percent of profit is nothing to scoff at.

158
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,120
Only a fool would turn down easy money.

159
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,399
Just tell me how much you need.

160
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,560
Ten thousand jars.

161
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
Ten thousand jars?

162
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,720
The silver needed to make that much wine

163
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
would be no less than a million taels.

164
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,079
A million taels of silver

165
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,000
is something my Han family can easily afford.

166
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,439
The question is whether you, Young Master Xiao, can handle it.

167
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,160
She's a real gambler.

168
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,759
Young Master Xiao is stunned.

169
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,560
If you agree to cooperate with my Han family,

170
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,759
Lingluo can even ask the master to step in.

171
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
He can help your father

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
become the head of the Xiao family.

173
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,759
Let my father become the family head?

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
There's such a good deal?

175
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,879
Then you would be the young master of the Xiao family.

176
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,360
But don't forget what Lingluo has done for you.

177
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,000
Alright.

178
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,480
Miss Han, just based on my words alone,

179
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,399
you believed I didn't make fake wine.

180
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,279
This kind of trust in my business ethics

181
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,519
really moves me.

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,440
You truly understand me.

183
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,519
Luckily, I hired enough people before.

184
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,399
Tomorrow, I'll expand the suburban facilities.

185
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,039
Your ten thousand jars of wine are on me.

186
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,360
Cheers!

187
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,919
Then I'll send someone to deliver it tomorrow.

188
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,879
The base wine needed for Xiaoyao Spring.

189
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,679
Thank you for your hard work.

190
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,159
This woman's way of winning people over

191
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,240
is truly frightening.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,559
If I get tied up with her,

193
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm afraid I'll be left with nothing.

194
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Jiang Yun.

195
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,840
Where is Jiang Yun?

196
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,360
Young Master Xiao.

197
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,919
I have something to discuss with her.

198
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,600
Young Master Xiao.

199
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,240
You...

200
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,960
W-what do you need?

201
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,279
You...

202
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,919
Why is your face so red?

203
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,440
Are you sick?

204
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,480
No, I'm not.

205
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
So this is where you're drinking.

206
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,960
Qingfeng.

207
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,679
I told you your young lady is a drunkard.

208
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,559
But you didn't believe me.

209
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm just tasting the Jade Nectar wine.

210
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,639
Seeing if there's anything that needs improvement.

211
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,200
You're about to finish the whole bottle.

212
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
You call that tasting?

213
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,720
Give it back to me.

214
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,159
Qingfeng, you have no idea.

215
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,480
She got drunk at my place.

216
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,399
She slept all sprawled out.

217
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,360
It was hilarious.

218
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Isn't that right?

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,320
Stop making things up!

220
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,039
I'm just saying you drank.

221
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,399
No need to exaggerate so much.

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,879
Qingfeng was just here.

223
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,480
Why are you so careless with your words?

224
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,480
Did you forget about a lady's reputation in ancient times?

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,159
Um...

226
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,000
I was wrong.

227
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,440
I didn't treat you as an outsider.

228
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,679
Not an outsider?

229
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,120
Could it be that Xiao Ning...

230
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Jiang Yun.

231
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,200
If you're not feeling well from drinking too much,

232
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,279
you should rest for a while.

233
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,600
As for dealing with the Han family,

234
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,039
I can handle the preparations myself.

235
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,039
What?

236
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,679
Are we finally going to take on the Han family?
