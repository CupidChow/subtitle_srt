1
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,920
Father Emperor

2
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

3
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,439
Xiao Ning

4
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,799
You are a commoner

5
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,520
How dare you trespass into the forbidden palace grounds?

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,399
I brought Xiao Ning here.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,799
He has a plan for governing the country to present to Father Emperor.

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,759
Your Highness

9
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,640
The harem must not interfere in state affairs.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,719
This was set by the Grand Emperor

11
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,200
as a rule personally.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,480
I am not the one proposing the policy.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,200
When have I ever interfered in state affairs?

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,920
This...

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,200
Xiao Ning

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,599
Minister Han said that you

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,760
harbor intentions to destabilize the state of Dajing

18
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,519
and personally requested an edict against you from me.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,159
Do you admit your guilt?

20
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,079
I am but a commoner

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,599
How could I bear such a heavy accusation from the Prime Minister?

22
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,599
Xiao Ning

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,239
Everyone knows you wish to become the imperial son-in-law.

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,000
It is because you interfered

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,200
that the marriage alliance with Beicang was delayed.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,040
If war were to break out,

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,599
could you bear the responsibility for the downfall of the court and country?

28
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,640
Prime Minister Han, your words are mistaken.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,079
A nation's strength lies in its own prosperity.

30
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,840
If we fear external invasion

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
and casually sacrifice the princess's happiness,

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,840
then what is the purpose of the countless men of Dajing

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,760
who have received the nation's favor?

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,120
Are you implying

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,560
that the men of Dajing are all cowards?

36
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,479
Nonsense!

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,759
Your Majesty

38
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,080
This old minister has no such intention.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
Moreover,

40
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,319
I already have a good plan

41
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,479
to ensure that Beicang will not go to war with Dajing.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
With all the civil and military officials present,

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,520
none would dare make such a bold claim.

44
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,960
You are but a commoner,

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
do not speak such nonsense here.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,319
Your Majesty

47
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,400
Beicang is remote and relies on a nomadic lifestyle.

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,439
Every conflict with Dajing

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,080
has been due to a lack of food.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
Now, commerce thrives in Dajing.

51
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,520
If we can expand trade to the north and west,

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,759
Beicang will naturally benefit as well.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,199
Then there will be no more disputes with Dajing.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,879
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,360
This must absolutely not be done.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,599
Xiao Ning's method

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,520
will transfer our nation's interests to Beicang.

58
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,159
This is an act of betraying the country, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,479
Prime Minister Han, if you don't understand business, then don't speak.

60
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,080
My way of doing business

61
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,159
is to use Beicang as a transit hub

62
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,719
to trade with various tribes.

63
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,439
All they do is transport goods.

64
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,360
It's just bartering.

65
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,400
This method is excellent.

66
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,599
Your Majesty,

67
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,120
Xiao Ning is merely a merchant.

68
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,280
Chasing profit is a petty pursuit.

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,840
Your Majesty must not trust him lightly.

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,560
The pillars of our nation should be us noble families.

71
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,240
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,759
If the noble families prosper, the nation prospers, Your Majesty.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,639
You noble families seize land and act as kings.

74
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,039
You withhold taxes from the court.

75
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,439
To me,

76
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,639
you deceive your superiors and mislead your subordinates.

77
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,280
You disrupt the order of the court.

78
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,680
To the people,

79
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,599
you act tyrannically, inciting the wrath of heaven and the resentment of the people.

80
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,199
How do you have the face

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,079
to utter the nonsense that the nation prospers with the noble families?

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,519
Your Majesty,

83
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,120
If Your Majesty insists on trusting Xiao Ning,

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,319
this old minister is willing to resign to show his resolve.

85
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,399
Please be vigilant, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,720
Please be vigilant, Your Majesty.

87
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,920
Your Majesty,

88
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:46,279
Your Majesty actually trusts

89
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,079
a merchant who only seeks profit so much.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,199
I'm afraid this will tarnish your reputation in the history books.

91
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,600
Are you trying to threaten me by resigning from your posts?

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Your Majesty,

93
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,519
All the ministers here are the pillars of our court.

94
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,319
If we lose them,

95
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,319
I'm afraid our nation's stability

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,519
will be at risk, Your Majesty.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,319
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
Your Majesty,

99
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,480
the scholars you personally selected,

100
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,399
nearly a hundred talented men from humble backgrounds,

101
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,759
have all been settled in the Yuxian Pavilion.

102
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,319
With just one word from you,

103
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,399
these power-hungry officials

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,399
can immediately be replaced by those scholars

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,399
from humble origins.

106
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
The national policies submitted a few days ago

107
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,160
were all drafted by those scholars.

108
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,160
To answer Your Majesty,

109
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,879
that is indeed the case.

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,519
Very good.

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Xiao Ning,

112
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,160
you've done well with this newspaper.

113
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,639
You've actually recruited for me

114
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,800
so many talented pillars of the state.

115
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,040
Are there really nearly a hundred scholars from humble backgrounds?

116
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,319
How could this be...

117
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,079
Weren't you all going to resign?

118
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,000
Hurry up and take off your official hats.

119
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,879
Let those scholars from humble backgrounds take your place.

120
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,279
Go on, take them off, take them off.

121
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you all still willing

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,519
to serve our nation?

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,839
Your Majesty,

124
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,120
we are willing.

125
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,279
Minister Han,

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,959
you have served the court for many years.

127
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,879
It's time for you to retire and enjoy your old age at home.

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Your Majesty,

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,040
This old minister still has some strength left.

130
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,199
I am willing to serve Your Majesty.

131
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,879
That won't be necessary.

132
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,800
The actions of Chancellor Han

133
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,439
have too many matters that need to be investigated.

134
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,879
Return to your residence and await the imperial decree.

135
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,800
Your Majesty, what do you mean by this?

136
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,000
I have served the Great Realm for decades,

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,560
working hard without complaint,

138
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,680
dedicating myself wholeheartedly.

139
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
I have never broken the law, Your Majesty.

140
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,240
Still pretending?

141
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,240
All those things you've done—

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,800
corruption, abuse of power, forming factions for personal gain—

143
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,519
they couldn't even fit in a single book.

144
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,079
Ignorant child!

145
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
How dare a mere commoner accuse this old minister?

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,040
This is pure slander!

147
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,399
Slander!

148
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,600
It's not slander.

149
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Your Majesty,

150
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,480
I, a humble woman, have here

151
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,399
evidence of the Han family's factionalism and self-serving actions,

152
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,120
as well as proof of their crimes against human life.

153
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,519
Madam

154
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,639
Why are you helping Xiao Ning frame me?

155
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,519
I am the one who has truly protected you all your life.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
I am not your wife.

157
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,759
You—

158
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,679
Han Wuguo

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,600
You secretly killed my father and brother for your own gain.

160
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,360
Did you really think I didn't know?

161
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,039
You—

162
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,200
You—

163
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
You wretch!

164
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,159
I'll kill you!

165
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,360
I'll kill you!

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,120
Protect His Majesty!

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
I'll kill you!

168
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,000
Take Han Wuguo to the Dali Temple for strict interrogation.

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,480
I will give justice to the whole world.

170
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,799
Yes.

171
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,120
Ignorant child!

172
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,799
I'll kill you!

173
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,279
Your Majesty is wise.

174
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,399
Your Majesty is wise.

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you, Young Master Xiao, for founding the newspaper.

176
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,840
Only then do I have the chance to realize my ambitions.

177
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,000
I am deeply grateful to Young Master Xiao for his great kindness.

178
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,240
It's what I should do.

179
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,039
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

180
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,720
That's right.

181
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,159
Those noble families

182
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,960
have oppressed ordinary people like us

183
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,000
for so many years.

184
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,960
Now that the Han family has been raided,

185
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,559
the noble families have collapsed.

186
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,559
Young Master Xiao has given us a new lease on life.

187
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,279
Young Master Xiao,

188
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:04,759
there's no need for that.

189
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,879
Young Master Xiao!

190
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,600
Something's wrong!

191
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
My lady has gotten into trouble!

192
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
Your lady is in trouble?

193
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Why are you looking for me?

194
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,559
Han Hongzhi,

195
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,440
you're already wanted by the authorities.

196
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,759
And you still dare to do such things?

197
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,279
Why don't you hurry to the Court of Justice and turn yourself in?

198
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,919
Turn myself in?

199
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,679
Young lady

200
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,320
You really are naive.

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
You've endured for years in the Han family.

202
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,440
Just to see us make fools of ourselves, right?

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,480
How could I let you get your way?

204
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,000
Look at how naive and alluring you are.

205
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:01,919
What are you trying to do?

206
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Don't touch me.

207
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,440
Young lady

208
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,840
My father hasn't been able to perform in bed for a long time.

209
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,279
I guess

210
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,840
he's never truly favored you, has he?

211
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,399
It's fine.

212
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,159
Today

213
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,360
I'll let you experience it for real.

214
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,360
Let go of me.

215
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,480
Let go.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Don't touch me.

217
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,799
Let go.
