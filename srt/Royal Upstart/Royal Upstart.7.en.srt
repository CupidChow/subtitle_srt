1
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,880
In my opinion,

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,079
no more than fifty thousand taels.

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,079
Xiao Ning,

4
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,600
do you have any objections?

5
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,560
Let's do as Young Master Han suggests.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,280
I'll go back and prepare the contract right away.

7
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,519
Is three days enough?

8
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,159
It's enough.

9
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,239
More than enough.

10
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,000
Master,

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,840
Xiao Ning is truly talented.

12
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,760
Acting so forcefully

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,599
might bring about unforeseen trouble.

14
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,159
Madam,

15
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,159
our Han family is the most prominent clan in the region.

16
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,640
Why should we fear someone as insignificant as Xiao Ning?

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,439
I know, Luo'er,

18
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,959
you're recruiting talent for the Han family.

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,040
But the Han family already has countless advisors.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
For just one Xiao Ning,

21
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,159
it's not worth troubling yourself so much.

22
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,759
Master, I can't help but feel uneasy about it too.

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
Master.

24
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,000
My dear Ning'er

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
You finally know how to save money.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,400
Father

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,080
Father

28
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,800
Father

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:42,879
Father

30
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,719
You

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,159
Your luggage

32
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,680
It's all in the bundle, right?

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,159
I-I haven't had time to pack yet.

34
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,199
That's great, that's great.

35
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,280
Hurry, hurry.

36
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,479
This time, I really can't afford to provoke them.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,439
Hurry up and go, hurry up and go.

38
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,240
You

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Your life is more important.

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,960
Go!

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
I knew a leopard can't change its spots.

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,599
It's not what you think.

43
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,039
I'll explain to you when I have time.

44
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,639
Such forceful seizure

45
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,719
There's not a trace of a proper prime minister in them.

46
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:08,879
I'll go find them.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,680
Han Wuguo is the prime minister.

48
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,960
Don't be so impulsive.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,360
So what if he's the prime minister?

50
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,039
As long as they're still citizens of our country,

51
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,280
I absolutely won't allow them to act like this.

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,199
Do whatever they want.

53
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,319
You don't need to worry about the Han family either.

54
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,639
I promise you,

55
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,039
No one in the capital would dare bully you.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,400
Of course, I keep my word.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,520
Alright.

58
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,960
Truly a heroine among women.

59
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,840
I admire you, truly.

60
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,960
The tea is a golden yellow when brewed.

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,560
The cup swirls with a floral aroma.

62
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,000
As expected, the tea here at Your Majesty's place is delicious.

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,159
Ling Luo greets Your Highness, the Princess.

64
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,360
No need for formalities. Please, have a seat.

65
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,839
Miss Han.

66
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,120
Miss Han.

67
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:24,959
Please.

68
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,240
Please.

69
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:32,839
This tea

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,959
comes from a tea shop among the common folk.

71
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,959
I've heard it has had quite an influence.

72
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,040
Recently, the literary style in Dajing has become more refined.

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,199
Prime Minister, are you familiar with this shop?

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,240
Isn't this Luo Qiuxian from the Tea Pavilion?

75
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,759
I didn't expect that Your Highness

76
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,600
also enjoys the tea brewed at the Tea Pavilion.

77
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,040
Miss Han, that's not quite correct.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,439
It's not that I

79
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,240
am fond of the Tea Pavilion's tea.

80
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,279
Rather, this tea

81
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,319
belongs to me.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,399
A simple tea shop

83
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,519
can actually inspire the scholars of Dajing.

84
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,600
To achieve this through business

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,000
is truly rare.

86
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,720
That's indeed the case.

87
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,720
So the methods you used before

88
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,560
must not be used on the Tea Pavilion.

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Your Majesty sees everything clearly.

90
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,759
This Tea Pavilion

91
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,399
can contribute so much to our Dajing.

92
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,519
I believe the court should protect it.

93
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,879
Why would Your Highness say that?

94
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,680
Young Master Xiao and I simply share similar interests.

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,519
We just discussed some business together.

96
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,959
Why talk about using any methods?

97
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,759
Miss Han, there's no need to play dumb.

98
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,839
What Her Highness means is

99
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,120
your Han family

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,879
is not allowed to forcibly acquire the Tea Pavilion from now on.

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Miss Qingfeng, don't be so fierce.

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,199
Since Her Highness has spoken,

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,079
as officials,

104
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,800
we naturally must obey.

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,360
It's just a small Tea Pavilion.

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
I actually don't care much about it.

107
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,079
What I want

108
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,480
is Young Master Xiao himself.

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,399
You are the young concubine of the Prime Minister's residence.

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,439
How can you say such embarrassing things?

111
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,360
Why is it embarrassing?

112
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,319
What Lingluo values is Young Master's way of doing business.

113
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,079
However,

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,839
someone as outstanding as Young Master Xiao—

115
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,800
who wouldn't want to keep him by their side?

116
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,360
Young Master Xiao is perceptive and wise.

117
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,959
He naturally knows who is truly trustworthy.

118
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,079
Then we

119
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,639
shall wait and see.

120
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,079
A small tea house

121
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,120
has actually attracted the attention of His Majesty and the princess.

122
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,240
It seems that Xiao Ning is highly valued.

123
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,319
I guess His Majesty wants to use Xiao Ning

124
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,000
as a pawn to break free from the influence of our noble families.

125
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Now that he has become a royal pawn,

126
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,920
we can no longer forcibly take over the tea house.

127
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,079
All industries in Dajing

128
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,240
are controlled by the noble families of Dajing.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,560
If His Majesty wants to fill the national treasury,

130
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,319
he has to start with these small businesses.

131
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,920
In my opinion, it's nothing to be afraid of.

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,319
Luo'er, you don't need to worry too much.

133
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,079
If a small tea house

134
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,079
can break through the blockade of the noble families,

135
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,799
and gives His Majesty confidence,

136
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,679
then in the future there will surely be

137
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,320
thousands upon thousands of tea houses appearing.

138
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,440
By then,

139
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,559
the status of our noble families

140
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,840
will probably be affected as well.

141
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,960
Luo'er, you think so far ahead.

142
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
In your opinion,

143
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,000
what should we do next?

144
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,240
To preserve the dignity of the royal family and the Han family,

145
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,039
we can't make a move for now.

146
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,200
However,

147
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,279
Father,

148
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,679
we're home.

149
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,879
Son,

150
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,039
are we really home this time?

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,799
Father, don't worry.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,480
I've already thought of a solution.

153
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,480
I'll make sure you can live here in peace.

154
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:29,879
Alright.

155
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,440
Young master,

156
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,519
everything is ready.

157
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,559
Father, I'm going out for a bit.

158
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,039
Alright.

159
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,960
Let's go.

160
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,240
Finally home.

161
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,000
Why hasn't that boy Xiao Ning come back yet?

162
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,919
We told him to arrange a meeting with the owner of the Tea Pavilion.

163
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,919
He hasn't even sent any word.

164
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,960
Father, Mother.

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,879
Xiao Ning is just a servant.

166
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
He probably can't invite them at all.

167
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,399
The owner of the Tea Pavilion.

168
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,600
That's why he's too ashamed to come back.

169
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,600
Master.

170
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,039
The Tea Pavilion has posted a notice.

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,879
It says the owner of the Tea Pavilion

172
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,600
is inviting all the tea shop owners for tea.

173
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,279
Before this,

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
we tried several times to meet the owner of the Tea Pavilion,

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,639
but never succeeded.

176
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,799
This time, we've been invited to taste tea.

177
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
This is intentional.

178
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,120
Yes.

179
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
We don't know if today

180
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,200
we'll gain anything.

181
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,440
Right?

182
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,080
Let's hope so.

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
Master Su

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,279
Master Xu is here too.

185
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,799
You actually want to get tea from the Nong Tea Pavilion as well?

186
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,600
Let me offer you all some advice,

187
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,440
You are all people of status.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,519
With the Su family here today,

189
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,120
I suppose

190
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,600
today is not your turn

191
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
to get the tea from the Nong Tea Pavilion.

192
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,720
Well...

193
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,399
You might as well leave early.

194
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,240
So you don't lose face.

195
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,600
What should we do now?

196
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,039
Yeah.

197
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,759
Look, even the top imperial merchant, the Huang family,

198
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,720
and the second, the Lin family, are here.

199
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,159
Master Huang, Master Lin.

200
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,039
You Su family actually dared to show up.

201
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,240
No matter what,

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,360
the Su family is still an imperial merchant.

203
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,200
Imperial merchant?

204
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,799
With the current state of your Su family,

205
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,960
you still have the nerve to call yourselves imperial merchants?

206
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,679
If it weren't for the Huang and Lin families

207
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,519
leaving you a bit to survive on,

208
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,919
your Su family

209
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,360
would have gone bankrupt long ago.

210
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,159
That's actually true.

211
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,039
Everyone knows the tea market is tough these days.

212
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,559
Whether any of us here can survive in this market

213
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,080
all depends on the Nongcha Pavilion.

214
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,720
Even top imperial merchants like Huang and Lin,

215
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,360
if we don't get the approval of Nongcha Pavilion,

216
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,919
our tea businesses will also go under.

217
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,919
So I hope everyone here

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,840
won't offend the owner of Nongcha Pavilion.

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,879
Otherwise, don't blame me, Huang,

220
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,679
for turning hostile.

221
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,039
Why should that be?

222
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,759
If we can't get tea from Nongcha Pavilion,

223
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,440
our Su family will be finished too!

224
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,679
Exactly.

225
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,919
So many people are waiting for Young Master Xiao.

226
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,639
Why don't you and I go greet him first?

227
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,360
It'll help us leave a good impression on Young Master Xiao.

228
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,240
That makes sense.

229
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,120
Please.

230
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,720
Let's go.

231
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,039
Nongcha Pavilion's business really is booming.

232
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,559
All three major imperial merchants are coming to them.

233
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,399
Sorry about that.

234
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,000
Sorry, everyone.

235
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,679
Thank you for waiting, thank you for waiting.

236
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,960
Well, well, Xiao Ning.

237
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,639
I told you to find someone,

238
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,879
but look at you,

239
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,840
hiding in Nongcha Pavilion and slacking off.

240
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,679
Xiao Ning, why didn't you come back to report?

241
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,360
This is the Su family's son-in-law.

242
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,519
Alright, alright, enough.

243
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,399
Hurry up and

244
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,679
bring out the owner of Nongcha Pavilion.

245
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,360
How dare he treat us so disrespectfully!

246
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,919
Our Su family is an imperial merchant!

247
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,919
Everyone,

248
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
the tea from Nongcha Pavilion has become extremely popular.

249
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,360
This has indeed caused some trouble for all of you.

250
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,320
So, the reason I called you all here today

251
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,000
is to decide to give a batch of tea

252
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,879
for you to sell at retail.

253
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,039
The profit won't be very high,

254
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,000
but I guarantee that for all of you,

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,799
it will be several times more than your salt tea business.

256
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,039
That's wonderful!

257
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,159
You are the owner of Nongcha Pavilion,

258
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,039
Young Master Xiao Ning?

259
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,080
You say he's the owner of Nongcha Pavilion?

260
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,240
Boss Sun,

261
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,440
are your eyes failing you in your old age?

262
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,080
If he were the owner of Nongcha Pavilion,

263
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,080
would the Su family still need to line up here?

264
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,159
Xiao Ning,

265
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,679
did you get a few people to cooperate with you

266
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,360
and put on a show for us?

267
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:42,600
I...

268
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,320
Stop making a scene.

269
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,159
Sorry to make everyone laugh.

270
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,279
Xiao Ning is the Su family's son-in-law.

271
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,399
He's just a servant at Nongcha Pavilion.

272
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,000
He's not the owner.

273
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,639
But we heard that the owner of Nongcha Pavilion

274
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,919
is indeed

275
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,440
a young man named Xiao Ning.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,120
That's right.

277
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,759
Impossible.

278
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,559
Young Master Xiao.

279
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,559
There you are.

280
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,360
Mr. Huang and I have been waiting for you for so long.

281
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,919
That's right.

282
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,279
You two, please don't do this.

283
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
You're making me feel really awkward.

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,720
You—

285
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,559
Xiao Ning.

286
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,360
How dare you be so disrespectful to Mr. Huang and Mr. Lin?

287
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,240
Kneel and apologize to the two elders at once.

288
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,039
Su Mingzhuo.

289
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,600
How dare you show such disrespect to the owner of the Tea Pavilion?

290
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,639
Such insolence.

291
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,720
Are you trying to force the Huang and Lin families

292
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,720
to take action against the Su family?
