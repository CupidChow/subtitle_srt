1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,209
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,610
Please give me your attention
for a moment.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,580
Before Jun Seo died, he left a will.

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,980
He signed up for life insurance...

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,050
worth a total of five million dollars
under the name...

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,589
of his fully-owned corporation,
Audiophile.

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:19,320
He indicated the legatee
of his company's full shares...

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,260
and the beneficiary
of the five million dollars.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,100
"To Jang Jae Gyeong..."

10
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,129
"and Oh Yoon Jin..."

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,500
What is this?

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,240
Jae Gyeong?

13
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,140
"in equally divided portions."

14
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:45,619
I know...

15
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,350
I'm late.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
However,

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,090
I came to tell you that.

18
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,659
I'll put everything back in order.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,130
This happened just a day
after he came to see me.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,399
How was he planning
to put everything back in order?

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,540
If he signed up for insurance
just a week ago,

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,870
did he feel like his life was threatened?

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,709
But why me and Yoon Jin?

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,709
The only clue that connects
to the one who drugged me...

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,579
is this text
that has Jun Seo's SOS code in it.

26
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,819
Jun Seo was a realtor,
so what did he have to do with drugs?

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,049
It's all my fault.

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,489
Who did this to me?

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,959
I made sure to tell him...

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,099
he wouldn't get any payment
if he committed suicide within two years.

31
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,170
No... I just...

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,400
I think it's all my fault.

33
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,140
What should I do, Jae Gyeong?

34
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:42,939
Jae Gyeong?

35
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:46,079
Are you listening to me?

36
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,390
Sorry for the long wait.

37
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,489
Not at all.

38
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,790
- Do you have everything?
- Yes.

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,200
You must've been so flustered earlier.

40
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,200
It's cold. Let's hurry back.

41
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,949
Hey, Ji Yeon.

42
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,009
Yes?

43
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,120
I did some thinking.

44
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,250
Jun Seo.

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,719
How about doing an autopsy?

46
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:31,889
What?

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Well...

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Jun Seo wasn't the type to kill himself.

49
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,729
Am I wrong?

50
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,229
Shouldn't we do everything we can?

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
If...

52
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,909
it wasn't suicide...

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,610
So it wasn't a suicide?

54
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,849
Did someone kill my husband?

55
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,349
No, well...

56
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,750
Just in case,
since it could be a possibility.

57
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,060
If an autopsy's done
and something is found,

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,030
they will all do something, you know.

59
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,689
You saw for yourself.

60
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,759
Among his friends...

61
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,669
is a prosecutor and a detective.

62
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,939
And a journalist too.

63
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,050
Don't cry.

64
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,620
I'll meet with Tae Jin and the doctor
and talk about it.

65
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,659
Try to consider...

66
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,759
doing an autopsy.

67
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:54,969
(Connection)

68
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,639
(Episode 3)

69
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:04,919
When did you know
about the insurance policy?

70
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,419
Just now.

71
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,120
Even if you just found out.

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Why didn't you discuss it with me
if you knew there was a will?

73
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,829
Why did you read it out
in front of everyone?

74
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
Hey.

75
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,329
Jang Jae Gyeong met with Heo Joo Song.

76
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,300
It was a matter of time
before he learned about the will.

77
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,009
Now that I announced it to everyone,

78
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,170
whatever Jae Gyeong says now,

79
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,509
people will think
it's about the insurance.

80
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,279
Guys.

81
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,819
What did Jun Seo actually say
on the phone...

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,649
before he died?

83
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,649
Hey.

84
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,689
What do you mean "actually?"

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,189
It was exactly as Jong Soo said.

86
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,259
So...

87
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,029
what was Jun Seo thinking when he made...

88
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,629
two people he wasn't close with
the beneficiaries?

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,569
If we feel this disappointed,
how must his wife feel?

90
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,569
Exactly.

91
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,410
If it turns out
that Jun Seo didn't kill himself,

92
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,509
they can take
the whole five million dollars.

93
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,509
Darn you.

94
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,850
Nothing changes.

95
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,949
It's a suicide case.

96
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:16,720
So no one will get any money.

97
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Then...

98
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,519
what about the autopsy?

99
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,089
There can't be an autopsy.

100
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,899
This is my opinion as a prosecutor.

101
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:27,829
In this kind of situation,

102
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,329
any other body would've been autopsied.

103
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,199
Jang Jae Gyeong's making a fuss right now,

104
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,410
but later on,
my office will get suspicious too.

105
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,610
It's better...

106
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,209
to perform an autopsy.

107
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,310
Hey.

108
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,250
Guys.

109
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,120
Can you wait outside?

110
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Let's go.

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,529
(Family Room)

112
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,560
Come on.

113
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,500
They whisper about
the important stuff among themselves.

114
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
We were all class officers.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,470
Why are we discriminated against?

116
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,579
Be quiet. They might hear.

117
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,310
Hey.

118
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,279
Sang Eui.

119
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,379
- What?
- Come here.

120
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,319
What?

121
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,560
Where was it?

122
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,990
Where Jun Seo was found dead.

123
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,629
It was Pilo-dong.

124
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,730
The old Fashion Town building.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Fashion Town?

126
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,339
The building under construction
a bit before the three-way intersection?

127
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,339
Yes.

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,209
Okay. You can go.

129
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,810
What?

130
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,579
Are you afraid something will show up
in the autopsy?

131
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,850
There's no guarantee nothing will.

132
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm bothered there was no suicide note.

133
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,889
Think about the will.
That was unexpected too.

134
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
So,

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,699
what did Jun Seo say to you guys
on the phone before he died?

136
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,740
Other than what I know.

137
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,639
Did he say anything else?

138
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,410
No.

139
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,110
Not to me.

140
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,220
It might be extra pressure on me,

141
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,019
but let's skip the autopsy.

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Officially,

143
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,689
we don't want to cut open our friend.

144
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,759
Actually,

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
on the written will,

146
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,430
there is...

147
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,439
one more name we all know.

148
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
What?

149
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,810
Who is it?

150
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,509
Lee Myung Guk.

151
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:56,750
Lee Myung Guk.

152
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,319
Lee Myung Guk?

153
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,850
Yes, Lee Myung Guk.

154
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,850
- Do you know the name?
- No. Do you?

155
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,259
I don't either.

156
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,220
That's weird.

157
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,730
Why didn't Tae Jin read out that name too?

158
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,329
Was it because we didn't know the person?

159
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,660
Didn't Jun Seo tell you anything?

160
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,329
Didn't you ask who that was?

161
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,569
Well, yes. I guess I should've asked.

162
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,639
Given the situation, didn't you
want to know who Lee Myung Guk was?

163
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,439
Do you think it's easy
to find someone with just a name?

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,120
(Lee Myung Guk, March 12, 1967,
670312-11353522)

165
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,549
Seriously?

166
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,220
(Funeral Hall)

167
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,289
Gosh.

168
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,259
(Lee Myung Guk, March 12, 1967,
670312-11353522)

169
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,730
They're back.

170
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,399
You're still here.

171
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,039
Did something happen in the car?

172
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,039
What?

173
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
No.

174
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,710
Hey, I could ask you.

175
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,710
- Say you get a life insurance policy.
- Yes.

176
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,840
If you kill yourself right after,

177
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,710
you don't get the money, do you?

178
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,720
Why do you suddenly want to know?

179
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,549
What? Well,

180
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,320
someone asked me.

181
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,460
Their friend committed suicide...

182
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
- and the policy...
- Which friend?

183
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,860
You wouldn't know them.

184
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,059
Tell us anyway.

185
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,029
What's up with you two?

186
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,659
It's a friend from my personal life.

187
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:20,830
I have lots of friends.

188
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,230
How much is the claim for?

189
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,399
How much did they say it was?

190
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
Five million dollars?

191
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,580
You saw the written will too.

192
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,409
Did you tell Jun Seo's wife?

193
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,549
- What?
- Did you tell her?

194
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,350
That Jun Seo named us as beneficiaries?

195
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,490
Do you think I'm crazy?

196
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,889
How did you find out?

197
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:51,629
Here.

198
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,169
Did you go through their mail?

199
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,929
It seemed weird.

200
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,269
The guy's dead,

201
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,940
and he had a pile of mail
from insurance companies.

202
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,769
I didn't mean to
go through the mail but then...

203
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,879
Wait.

204
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,210
How did you find out?

205
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,149
I helped him take out all these policies.

206
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,519
I see.

207
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,519
That works out, then.

208
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,419
I was wondering how to explain this.

209
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,090
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,490
They should do an autopsy.

211
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,559
You were very right earlier.

212
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,929
Too many things are suspicious.

213
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,370
Do you think they'll find something
in the autopsy?

214
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,909
It's a clear proof of murder.

215
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,679
Goodness.

216
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,750
(The late Park Jun Seo)

217
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:49,889
Ji Yeon.

218
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,500
Jang Jae Gyeong.

219
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,539
You're still here.

220
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I thought you'd left.

221
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,210
Let's do the autopsy.

222
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,669
I'll convince Ji Yeon.

223
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,779
Are you doing this
because you want the insurance money?

224
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,779
You seem to be mistaken.

225
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,649
It's better for you guys
if Jun Seo killed himself.

226
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:21,649
If not,

227
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,559
you three would be
at the top of the suspect list.

228
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,429
You and I both
investigate cases for a living.

229
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,200
Let's forget about the nonsense.

230
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,799
Let's persuade Ji Yeon
and rush the autopsy.

231
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,870
You seem pretty sure...

232
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,539
something will show up
if an autopsy is done.

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's suspicious.

234
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,110
Hey, Tae Jin.

235
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Jun Seo took out...

236
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,309
the policies a week before he died.

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,240
What do you think this means?

238
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,779
It means he wants someone
to look into his death, doesn't it?

239
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,779
What do they think they're doing?

240
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,919
Why?

241
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,450
You wanted to reveal the truth.

242
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,090
Wasn't this what you wanted?

243
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,460
But...

244
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,960
you know what we must reveal first
in order to reveal the rest, don't you?

245
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,299
You and I both make a living
doing investigations.

246
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,470
You must be devastated,

247
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,539
but this is all just part
of the investigation.

248
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,279
I'm Prosecutor Park Tae Jin from Anhyun
District Public Prosecutor's Office.

249
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,409
What is going on?

250
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,549
I'm Lieutenant Park In Soo
of Anhyeon Police Station.

251
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,149
There's something
we need to investigate...

252
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,620
regarding Mr. Park Jun Seo's death.

253
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,490
Is that so?

254
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,159
You should come with us too,
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong.

255
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,230
I'll explain to you on the way.

256
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,529
Is this perhaps about the insurance
and his will?

257
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,600
Hey, Park Tae Jin.

258
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,570
What do you mean, a will?

259
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,940
Ji Yeon, I think it'd be better
if I explained that to you.

260
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,200
You, be quiet.

261
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,840
I should've told you about it first.

262
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,039
Jun Seo...

263
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,679
took out a five-million-dollar
life insurance policy before he died.

264
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:56,409
But...

265
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,620
the beneficiary wasn't you
but these two people here.

266
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,250
For five million dollars.

267
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,960
That's what I find strange too.

268
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,460
It doesn't make sense that he'd leave
that much money to me,

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,860
a friend he rarely contacts.

270
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,960
- So...
- So,

271
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,840
is that why you wanted to do an autopsy?

272
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,500
- No, that's not it.
- No, that's...

273
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,639
You said my husband wasn't someone
who'd commit suicide!

274
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,639
But...

275
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,840
I still think the same.

276
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,750
- Also...
- Because of the insurance money?

277
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,019
This is all about that insurance money,
isn't it?

278
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,220
How could you people...

279
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,460
How could you do this
at your friend's funeral?

280
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,820
Do you still call yourselves his friend?

281
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,330
Please calm down.

282
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,230
I'm sorry.
I should've told you beforehand,

283
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,629
but you weren't here earlier.

284
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,200
Everyone involved is here,
so we should all go together.

285
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,840
Yoon Jin, Joo Song.
You should come with us too.

286
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,669
Ji Yeon, please calm down first.
Come this way.

287
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,809
Come with me.

288
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,080
You should stay here.

289
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
Okay.

290
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,139
I'm only here as a testifier.

291
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,809
Why are you interviewing me in here?

292
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,080
I asked to do it here.

293
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,509
We should at least hear
what he has to say.

294
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,019
Good.

295
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,159
Sorry for making you come
at such a late hour.

296
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,460
Also, may he rest in peace.

297
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,259
This won't take long.

298
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,559
The two of you.

299
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,740
Were you aware of the fact
that the deceased wrote a will?

300
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,370
- No.
- No.

301
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,409
Then, from both your perspectives,

302
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,970
do you consider yourselves close enough...

303
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,179
to Mr. Park Jun Seo that
he'd leave you his insurance money...

304
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,909
of five million dollars
instead of his family?

305
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
Well, I'm also aware...

306
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,279
that you didn't kill Mr. Park...

307
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,850
with the intention of receiving
five million dollars.

308
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,019
Excuse me.

309
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,549
Please watch what you say.

310
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,320
Did what I say bother you?

311
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,259
I'm just saying.

312
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,159
If you had really killed Mr. Park...

313
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,960
with the intention of
getting five million dollars,

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,129
you would've made it look like
a murder or an accident.

315
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,429
You wouldn't have made it look like
a suicide.

316
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,570
I said that out of consideration
for you two.

317
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,210
You know?

318
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,809
Then, why do you think Mr. Park
left you five million dollars?

319
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,179
Neither of you are able to give me
any particular answers.

320
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,080
I don't understand this situation at all.

321
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,879
Is it just me?

322
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,789
That's right.

323
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:50,149
We also find that strange.

324
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,720
Honestly, Park Jun Seo wasn't
a close friend who kept in touch with us.

325
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,759
Why did he do such a thing?

326
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:58,500
So, do the autopsy as you should,

327
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,000
and let's do this investigation right.

328
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,070
Park Tae Jin is behind that mirror, right?

329
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,639
Did you ask him?

330
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,570
What is the reason he's against
doing an autopsy...

331
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,639
when someone who fell from the ninth floor
of a construction site...

332
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,440
took out a five-million-dollar
insurance policy a week ago?

333
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
Seriously, quiet down.

334
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,850
Weren't you able to ask him?

335
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,309
Why?

336
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,919
Are you still crawling on the floor
at one word from a prosecutor?

337
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,919
Hey, punk.

338
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,590
I'm seriously trying to
wrap this up nicely.

339
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,820
Are you out of your mind?

340
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,360
Do you seriously want to
come in as a testifier...

341
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,519
and leave as a suspect?

342
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,190
Fine, let's do that.

343
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,159
I'm fine with becoming the suspect.
Just do your job.

344
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,029
Don't embarrass yourself.

345
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,529
Why, you little...

346
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:42,509
Everyone, calm down.

347
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,379
Let's just look at the facts.

348
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,610
There were no signs of foul play
at the site.

349
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,350
And as the prosecutor who conducted
the postmortem screening.

350
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,179
I didn't find anything
out of the ordinary.

351
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,789
Does the police have anything more to add?

352
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,360
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- Don't call my name so easily.

353
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,359
I'm here as a prosecutor right now,
not as your friend.

354
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,230
Got it?

355
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,630
Anything else?

356
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
No, sir.

357
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,809
The family has already expressed...

358
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,369
that they do not want to do an autopsy.

359
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,579
Let's proceed with that.

360
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,220
Why? Is there something
we might find in Jun Seo's body?

361
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,519
What are you trying to hide
that you're going this far?

362
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,690
Say it, you jerk.

363
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,019
That's enough!

364
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,130
Are you crazy?

365
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,589
What do you think you're doing right now?

366
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,339
I'm Chief of Police, Bae Byung Ho.

367
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,539
I hope the funeral goes well.

368
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,380
We must also do our jobs.
Please understand...

369
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,210
that things have come to this.

370
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,750
Inspector Yoo, wrapt things up quickly.

371
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,990
Yes, sir.

372
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,250
I thought the family said
they didn't want to do an autopsy.

373
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes, sir.

374
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,690
Then, what more is there to discuss?

375
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,759
Take her back so that they can continue
with the funeral.

376
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,789
Chief!

377
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,470
Prosecutor, join me for a cup of tea
in my office.

378
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,200
Sure.

379
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,670
The autopsy...

380
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,019
I want to do the autopsy.

381
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,920
I think he's asking me to do it.

382
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,720
What are you talking about?

383
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,130
Jun Seo is already dead!

384
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,990
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- My goodness.

385
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,029
Why are you all so eager
to cut up a dead man's body?

386
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,529
Ji Yeon, why are you doing this?

387
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,509
I just want to feel at ease.

388
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,009
No matter how I think about it,

389
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,950
I can't believe that he committed suicide.

390
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,579
After Yoon Hee left,

391
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,650
I wanted to die several times myself.

392
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,859
But I'm still alive.

393
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,160
He said to me.

394
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,299
Our dear Yoon Hee...

395
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,640
would've gone to a nice place.

396
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,009
So, in order to meet Yoon Hee again,

397
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,349
we should live the rest of our lives
as good people too.

398
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,150
We should wash away all of our sins
if we have any.

399
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,619
But someone like that, committing suicide?

400
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,190
I want to know exactly
if there was any other reason.

401
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,130
But if it really was suicide,

402
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,670
I'll just curse at him all I want, then.

403
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,279
Then, as per the family's request,

404
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,549
we will conduct an autopsy
on Mr. Park Jun Seo.

405
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:21,589
Prosecutor.

406
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Go ahead.

407
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,369
(Interview Room)

408
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,089
Is this normally how you do your job
as a prosecutor, you punk?

409
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,789
I told you to stop that autopsy,
no matter what, didn't I?

410
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,630
- Jong Soo.
- Shut up.

411
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,529
You called me all the way
to the police station...

412
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,970
and made me look like a fool.

413
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,000
At this rate, will you be able to
stay my friend for life?

414
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,839
You must be very anxious.

415
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:10,609
What, anxious?

416
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,109
You and I were there together.

417
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,250
We saw it together.

418
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,950
What's the problem?

419
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,250
Nothing will be detected
from Jun Seo's body. So...

420
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,089
Even if something is detected,
you should go ahead and stop it. Got it?

421
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,430
Even if you have to step down
from being a prosecutor,

422
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,759
just stop it this time. Okay, punk?

423
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,599
Understood?

424
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,839
- Understood.
- Answer me loudly, punk!

425
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,609
Okay. Someone might hear you.

426
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,200
We'll now start the autopsy.

427
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:48,609
(Park Jun Seo)

428
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,180
(Rest in peace)

429
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,000
- Here.
- Thanks.

430
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,039
What are you doing?

431
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,410
It's Jae Gyeong.
I'm going to send him Jun Seo's pictures.

432
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,339
What's wrong with him?

433
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,650
He caused all that fuss,
but he was not here for the funeral.

434
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,579
Exactly.

435
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,579
He said something urgent came up
at work.

436
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,619
He was always like that.

437
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,150
He's so self-centered.

438
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,759
Everyone asked me where he was.

439
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,130
Of course,
no one would understand it.

440
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you think things will be calm
until the autopsy report comes out?

441
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,529
From what I hear,

442
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,039
it'll take a month for the result
at the earliest.

443
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Gosh.

444
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Hey.

445
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,509
I can't just sit around until then.

446
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,579
Jun Seo wrote my name in his will.

447
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,750
This means I have a role to play.

448
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,019
I'll make sure...

449
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,490
I play that role right.

450
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,099
Early this morning,

451
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:24,299
someone reported those two fighting
in front of a convenience store.

452
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,869
The station nearby dispatched,

453
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,240
and even with the naked eye,

454
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,940
it was obvious both were suspicious
of using drugs.

455
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,910
Also,

456
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,549
they found this in the pocket
of one of them.

457
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:36,779
It's that drug again.

458
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,819
Did you find out anything about it?

459
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,250
Yes.
It became popular about three months ago.

460
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,690
They told people...

461
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,319
it could make you feel happy
and help you focus.

462
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,960
They started selling it
through word of mouth.

463
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,230
It's highly addictive,

464
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,329
and the tolerance level is high.

465
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,759
It recently started
to cause serious issues.

466
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,769
Does it have a name?

467
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,029
I heard it's called Lemon Mulberry.

468
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,180
(Heo Joo Song: Here's Jun Seo
on his way. Good luck with work.)

469
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,700
On February 27, 2024, around 4:00 a.m.,

470
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,569
you two had a brawl
in front of a convenience store...

471
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,039
in Panseo-dong, Anhyun,
before you were taken to a station.

472
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:38,609
That's right.

473
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,309
- Continue.
- Okay.

474
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,750
The patrol station
found you suspicious of drug usage,

475
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,880
and you were sent here.

476
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,750
Do you admit to using drugs?

477
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,960
I told you, I didn't use drugs.

478
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,890
Since you won't admit to it,

479
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,890
we'll go ahead
and conduct urine and hair tests.

480
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,829
We'll stop recording until the tests.

481
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,349
Hey.

482
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Did you fight over this?

483
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Sit down.

484
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,759
Put your hands down.

485
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Since when did you take these?

486
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,839
If you answer me, I'll give it to you.

487
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,470
Maybe since two months ago? No.

488
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,140
I think about a month and a half ago.

489
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,380
How long does a pill last?

490
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,650
It lasts for a day or two at first,
but then...

491
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:52,849
Does it last shorter?

492
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,119
Yes.

493
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,190
How long has it been
since you last had one?

494
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Detective.

495
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,759
I haven't had one for a week!

496
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,500
Why has it been so long?
Were you not able to get any?

497
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,299
It has become very difficult
to get them since two weeks ago.

498
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,609
- Please...
- How many do you take now?

499
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Now?

500
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,750
Four.

501
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,079
- "Four?"
- Yes.

502
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,019
Did you take other drugs before?

503
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,450
Yes.

504
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,490
What's different with this one?

505
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,119
Try it.

506
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,859
Try one.

507
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,069
Hand it over!

508
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,109
You said you'd give it to me!

509
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,039
- Get up, jerk!
- Hand it over!

510
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,250
- You said you'd give it to me.
- Get him!

511
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,609
Let go!

512
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:57,910
Give it to me!

513
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,450
- Come with me.
- You're a liar!

514
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,950
Come on!

515
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,519
Give it to me.

If you feel uncomfortable
going home alone,

518
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,700
would you like us to come with you?

519
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:20,099
No, it's okay.

please call me.

523

Okay.

524
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,049
I'll get going too.

525
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,079
I see. Thank you for everything.

526
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,319
As for the realtor office,
I'll help you get it organized...

527
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:36,390
after all the urgent matters
are dealt with.

528
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,920
So don't worry about that
and get a few days of good rest.

529
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
Okay.

530
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,460
- Who is that?
- Oh, she's...

531
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,859
She was the manager
of the realty my husband used to run.

532
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,029
I see.

533
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,069
Are you planning to get rid of it?

534
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,069
Yes.

535
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,099
It'll be difficult to run without him.

536
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,539
I'll do that in time.

537
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,809
- Let's get together to eat soon.
- Thanks for coming out so far.

538
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,740
- It looks like they're leaving.
- We'll all go together.

539
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,740
Let's meet up soon.

540
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
Bye.

00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:05,619
Are you leaving?

542
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,619
- Yes.
- We'll get going.

543
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,890
Thank you and sorry for troubling you.

544
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,230
Bye.

545
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,359
Take care.

546
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,829
Take care.

547
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,200
Even their exit looks cool.

548
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,369
You're right.

549
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,740
So,

550
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,670
what's the next step?

551
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,569
What do you mean?

552
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,910
You want to play the role...

553
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,380
of uncovering the truth
behind Jun Seo's death.

554
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,509
What will you do first?

555
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,579
- Are you going to join me?
- Yes.

556
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Jun Seo came...

557
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,650
to me to sign up for insurance
and wrote a will.

558
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,289
He was acting so strange,

559
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,890
but I didn't ask him any questions
or help him.

560
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,130
Maybe that was why he died.

561
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,759
My heart feels heavy.

562
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,769
Of course, I like being around you too.

563
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,799
Are you really doing this
because of the insurance money?

564
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,670
Yes.

565
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,309
What?

566
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,250
Don't look at me like that.

567
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,519
Jang Jae Gyeong is not any different.

568
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,079
What will you do with the money?

569
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,119
Ye Eun.

570
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,289
I want to bring her back
and live with her.

571
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:29,400
Why does thinking
about her make me hungry?

572
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,069
For some reason,
I get hungry whenever I think of her.

573
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,369
Hold on. Should we eat something?

574
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
I know a good noodle place nearby.

575
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,549
Let's have a bowl each...

576
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,579
so we can live long noodle-like lives.

577
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:46,650
That sounds great.

578
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Let's go.

579
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,890
So is this called Lemon Mulberry?

580
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Yes.

581
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,390
What a fantastic name.

582
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:59,099
They were selling it high
and low online and offline.

583
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,799
Why did they suddenly stop supplying?

584
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,829
The supply has been scarce
since two weeks ago.

585
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,799
Maybe they had trouble keeping up
with the demands.

586
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,240
It's designed
to be highly effective and addictive.

587
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,269
They were planning to sell
a large sum in a short time.

588
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,269
It's different
from the drugs we saw before.

589
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,779
Hallucination symptoms
aren't as severe as meth.

590
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,910
Instead,
it can actually clear your head...

591
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,309
and give you confidence at first.

592
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,519
Those two started using it
for better concentration...

593
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,279
and to boost their confidence.

594
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,920
But the drug wears out fast,

595
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,119
so you feel lethargic
and get shortness of breath.

596
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,420
Most of all, it encourages you
to increase the dosage.

597
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,230
Which then damages the central nerves.

598
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
It must be easy for someone
to start using them.

599
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,859
This is dangerous.

600
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,769
First, check the regular supply routes
and ask around.

601
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:39,569
If someone new is responsible for this,

602
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm sure they would know already.

603
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,039
Get out there and fetch something.

604
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,339
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

605
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,539
Jang Jae Gyeong.

606
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,279
Yes?

607
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,690
You forgot to turn in your firearm again?

608
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,089
- Yes.
- Hand it in now.

609
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,920
The guy in charge called.

610
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Okay.

611
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,910
Let's make it tomorrow at midnight.

612
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,150
If you go past midnight,

613
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,720
I'll also stop dealing Lemon Mulberry...

614
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,250
and focus on going around to catch people.

615
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,660
(Doctor)

616
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:50,369
Doctor.

617
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,339
Have you heard of a CEO Yoon?

618
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,609
"CEO Yoon?" No.

619
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,950
They're a Lemon Mulberry distributor.

620
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,819
- Where did you get that info?
- From Jang Chul Gu.

621
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,980
- He doesn't know who it is?
- No.

622
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,690
I'll look into it.

623
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,950
That Lee Myung Guk guy.

624
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,819
Yes.

625
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:10,460
Jae Gyeong doesn't seem to know
who Lee Myung Guk is?

626
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,130
Right.

627
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,569
He asked his colleague to run the ID.

628
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,470
- Do you know him?
- What?

629
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,440
You know,

630
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,910
when I saw that name on the will...

631
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:32,519
in the dim light of the corridor,
my hair stood on end.

632
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,079
(Lee Myung Guk,
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals researcher)

633
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,079
He's missing?

634
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,519
Yes. He was reported missing
seven months ago.

635
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,890
He was last seen entering...

636
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,230
the subway station by his office.

637
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,089
- Who reported him missing?
- A colleague.

638
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:45,400
Where did he work at?

639
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,700
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals.

640
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,400
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals?

641
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,269
Won Jong Soo's the CEO.

642
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:51,769
Correct.

643
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,140
It's a subsidiary of Geumhyung Group...

644
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:56,440
that Vice-Chairman Won Jong Soo
runs in person.

645
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,210
How did you get to know Lee Myung Guk?

646
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,049
He wanted to report
some internal corruption.

647
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,210
He asked me to put it in the paper.

648
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:07,220
- Did you meet up with him?
- Hey.

649
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,690
Do you think he was the only one
with such a story?

650
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,360
So you didn't meet him?

651
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,159
I said no and was about to hang up.

652
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:21,030
That last comment hit me hard.

653
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,030
He had terminal lung cancer.

654
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,130
Criminal Affairs Division One
looked into it.

655
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,840
They didn't think
it was linked to any other case.

656
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,469
They're assuming he took drastic measures
due to his negative situation.

657
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
No way.

658
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,750
That meant he had nothing to lose.

659
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,619
It's no joke when someone like that
decides to blow the whistle.

660
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,650
Right.

661
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:44,519
But he didn't show up
on the day we were supposed to meet.

662
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,989
- I couldn't reach him either.
- Then...

663
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,690
Yes.

664
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,659
I heard later on...

665
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,760
that it was the day after
he'd gone missing.

666
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,570
Hey.

667
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,239
Shouldn't you tell Jae Gyeong right away?

668
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,369
Who, me?

669
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:06,539
Should I?

670
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,579
Darn it.

671
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,449
I don't want to.

672
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,750
Still, you should.

673
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,849
Okay, I will tell him.

674
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,260
I know pretty well
where he is and what he's doing.

675
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,929
(Mijoo Apartments)

676
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,929
Who is it?

677
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,769
- Does Lee Eun Hee live here?
- It's mine!

678
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:33,070
Then which is mine?

679
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,269
- Mr. Lee Myung Guk's daughter.
- Will you be quiet?

680
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:37,940
That's me.

681
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:39,579
I'm from Anhyeon Police Station.

682
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:46,119
- Pow...
- Pow...

683
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,690
The police gave it back
saying they didn't need it.

684
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:53,690
Do you need it again?

(Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals)

686
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,829
Have you heard the name
"Park Jun Seo" before?

687
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,559
No.

688
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,929
What did your father do
at Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals?

689
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,440
I don't know well. He was a researcher.

690
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,869
Sometimes he made copies
of foreign medications,

691
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,010
and sometimes he developed something new.

692
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,349
Did anyone from the company visit...

693
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,449
or contact you?

694
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,119
No.

- Bye.

Hey. What is it called?

- Lemon Mulberry.
- "Lemon Mulberry?"

700
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,570
What a simply obvious name.

701
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,869
The pill color
plus a slang term for drugs.

702
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,599
- Anything else?
- That's it.

703
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,340

- No.
- Hey.

What's going on?

721
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,900
Are you okay?

722
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,530
Hey.

723
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,199
This won't do.

724
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:20,800
Get up.

725
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,710
Try to walk.

726
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,840
Let's take my car.

727
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,760
Which hospital should we go to?
Are you registered anywhere?

728
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,659
No hospitals.

729
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,530
What are you on about?

730
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,130
You're sick.
You need to go to a hospital.

731
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,440
You can't take me to a hospital.

732
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,340
Home.

733
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,710
Take me home.

734
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:18,530
We're almost there.

735
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,869
Jae Gyeong.

736
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,000
What's the code to the door?

737
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,539
Zero.

738
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,610
- Five.
- Five.

739
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,610
Zero, two.

740
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,079
Zero, two.

741
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:43,949
Hey.

742
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,719
Come on.

743
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,800
Hang on.

744
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,300
Wait.

745
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,769
There's nothing in here.

746
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,380
Jae Gyeong.

747
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:15,449
Drink this.

748
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:20,659
Goodness.

749
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,429

(Park Jun Seo)

752
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,239
Lemon Mulberry.

753
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,579
I see that
you've already taken all your pills.

754
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,280
Take this when you really need it.

755
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,730
What is it?

756
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
It...

757
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,869
It was inside, wasn't it?

758
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,139
What was?

759
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,079
Give it to me.

760
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,889
I don't know what you're talking about.

761
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:58,989
What?

762
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,190
Let go!

763
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:04,989
Let go of me!

764
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,409
Yoon Jin, open the door.

765
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
No.

766
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Open the door.

767
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,309
This is a drug.

768
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,920
Come to your senses, Jang Jae Gyeong.

769
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:28,849
I can't do without that.

770
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:31,590
I might die without that.

771
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:32,960
Help me!

772
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,760
Why did you get like this?

773
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,329
How could you do drugs?

774
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,469
Open the door.

775
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,739
Do you think I can't open this up?

776
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,650
Please, come to your senses, Jae Gyeong.

777
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,119
Open up.

778
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,250
Come to your senses.

779
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:07,389
Come to your senses, Jang Jae Gyeong!

780
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,269
(Tuesday, February 27, 6:30 p.m.)

781
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,940
Jun Seo.

782
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,949
He came to see me the day before he died.

783
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,849
This was the tenth time.

784
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:17,989
What?

785
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,389
The number of times
Jun Seo came to see me.

786
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,619
This was the tenth time.

787
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,329
Seeing how I can remember
how many times it was,

788
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,369
I must've been waiting for Jun Seo too.

789
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,199
What did he say when he came by?

790
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,969
The same thing each of the ten times.

791
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,369
To forgive him.

792
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
No way.

793
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,150
About what happened 20 years ago?

794
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,550
So,

795
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:49,949
what did you say?

796
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,690
I said the same thing each time too.

797
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:56,389
That I didn't want to hear it...

798
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,300
and that he should get out of my life.

799
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,199
If I accepted his apology then,

800
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,539
he'd still be alive, right?

801
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,610
That idiot.

802
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,820
He should've just said it.
Why would he die?

803
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,559
Whether or not I forgive him,

804
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:31,090
he could've just lived fine on his own.

805
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:34,500
What am I to him?

806
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,300
Why did he keep coming back,
and ten times at that?

807
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:45,469
And until the end,
I kept refusing to forgive him.

808
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,610
How did you end up like this?

809
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,079
I don't remember.

810
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,420
After a team dinner,

811
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,519
I was abducted by someone
in the bathroom.

812
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,389
When I opened my eyes,
three days had gone by.

813
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:04,460
And I was already addicted to drugs.

814
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,400
Sorry about earlier.

815
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,469
Is there someone you suspect?

816
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,780
But what's weird is...

817
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,480
that Jun Seo, who was a real estate agent,

818
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,250
was involved in drugs.

819
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,059
I can't prove it yet,

820
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:35,190
but that's the only lead.

821
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,260
Still, for now,

822
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:41,000
let's tell someone about this.

823
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,559
No.

824
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,039
You might really end up in big trouble
at this rate.

825
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,269
I saw a woman die in front of her child
after taking that pill.

826
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,739
Her eyes weren't human.

827
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,809
Tell the police
about this right away, okay?

828
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,980
And you need to go to the hospital.

829
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:05,519
No.

830
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,219
Why not?

831
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:09,929
If this gets out,
I will be taken off this case.

832
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,900
If I step aside from this,
no one will be interested in this case.

833
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,559
You saw it too.

834
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,530
The prosecutor and detective in charge...

835
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,500
tried to have him cremated
without an autopsy.

836
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:21,900
Please keep it a secret for now.

837
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,280
You can't tell anyone that I'm addicted.

838
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,340
If I'm taken off the case,

839
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,250
the insurance money you're hoping to get
is gone too.

840
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,920
Once everything is sorted out,
I'll tell them myself.

841
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,059
Until then, this fact can't get out,

842
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,730
and I can't collapse.

843
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,530
Do you...

844
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,630
still have that pill?

845
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,239
No.

846
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:55,699
I got rid of it.

847
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:58,809
In the bathroom.

848
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,280
Good.

849
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:10,849
You did well.

850
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,159
Where are you going in that state?

851
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,530
There isn't much time.

852
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,230
Someone made me get addicted,

853
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,099
and someone did that to Jun Seo.
We have to find out quickly.

854
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,010
If you're going to go
to Lee Myung Guk's house,

855
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,510
I'll give you a ride.

856
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:42,579
I'll tell you on the way...

857
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,949
about how I know Lee Myung Guk.

858
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,150

- Yes.

- Yes.

862
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,539

What will you do if you faint again?

868
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,550
Hurry up and open it.

869
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:50,619
Fine, don't open it.

870
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,460

What is it?

874
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:14,409
It's nothing. It's just a clothesline.

875
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,650
I hit my head on it.

876
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,309
Be careful.

877
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,159
Hey, is it okay to just go in like this?

878
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,289
Is it above or below?

879

Above?

00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,900
Hurry over with Forensics.

906
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,400
Was it 63-38, 973 Inhyun-ro?

907
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,500
That's right.

908
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,070
Understood.

909
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,980
Is it normal for a dead body...

910
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:47,250
to have that much fluid pouring out?

911
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,380
No, not this much.

912
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,159
Lee Myung Guk went missing
around late July last year.

913
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,489
It has been seven months,

914
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:58,889
but the body hardly decomposed.

915
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:01,030
This means he was frozen after death...

916
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,760
and was only defrosted recently.

917
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,130
That is why there is so much body fluid.

918
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:10,409
But...

919
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,210
If they went through
the trouble of hiding him,

920
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:15,239
why did they bring him out now?

921
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,380
Exactly my point.

922
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,480
No one even knew he was dead
for the last seven months.

923
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:49,809
Come on.

924
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,829
What's going on?

925
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,599

926
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:13,800
Jae Gyeong, what's the matter?

927
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,670
Hey! Wake up!

928
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,039
It's no time for this.

929
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,340
The police cars are coming.

930
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:22,380
Wake up. Jae Gyeong!

931
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,909
Go to the car.

932
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,579
What? Okay, let's go.

933
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,980
Wait.

934
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,590
Can you get up?

935
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,960
Go.

937
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,500

938
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:24,539
Hey, Jae Gyeong. Wake up.

939
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,170
Where should I go?

940
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,980
To the police station.

941
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,409
What?

942
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,550
We just dodged them.
Why would we go to the station?

943
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,119
Hurry to the station.

944
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,989

945

949

What's the matter?

953
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,860
Are you feeling sick?

954
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,769
Can you go get me some medicine?

955
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,139
- What do you need?
- One for digestion...

956
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,039
and one for fevers.

957
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:32,739
Wait just a moment.

958
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,230
Let go!

959
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,699
You said you'd give it to me!

960
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,800
Come on.

961
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,380
Yes?

962
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,710
I'll keep it safe.

963
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Wake up.

964
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,130

write down the students' creed
word for word on the blackboard...

970
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:14,099

- Did you finish cleaning?
- Yes.

01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,570
What about the students' creed?

978
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,670
I didn't write it down.

979
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,340
How are you so bold?
Didn't you just transfer here?

980
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:34,349
Are you the president here too?

981
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,320
I guess. Why?

for the rest of your days here.

985
