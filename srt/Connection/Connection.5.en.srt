(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,890
Gosh.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,890
Does he think he's all grown up now?

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,960
He thinks it's actually okay...

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,190
for him to sleep over at a friend's house.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,329
I'll head home after a couple more rounds.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,230
Yes.

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,239
No.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,039
I'll eat at home.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,810
Just set something simple. Okay.

11
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:40,140
(Connection)

12
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,040
(Episode 5)

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,609
(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

14
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,849
(Time spent on committing the crime)

15
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:54,920
Five minutes.

16
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,359
(5-6 minutes to commit the crime)

17
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,689
At most, six minutes.

18
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,560
(5-6 minutes to commit the crime)

19
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,340
It was still bright out.

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
If they had walked through
the main street,

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,639
people would have noticed
since they were covered in blood.

22
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,969
(Who is the Pilo-dong redevelopment for?)

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,840
But there are no witnesses.

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,409
I'm certain they escaped in a vehicle.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,979
Let me go and grab
a flash drive from my car.

26
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,789
(We press our own oils.)

27
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,889
The culprit knew I would head back
to my car.

28
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,030
Where were they watching from?

29
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,430
(Modeun Hardware Store)

32
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,710
(Pilo-dong site, Mill)

33
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,379
It was 12:31 p.m.

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,150
Construction work
was going on in that alley.

35
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,020
If he came in...

36
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,479
this was the only way.

37
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,219
(Construction in progress)

38
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,020
(Modeun Hardware Store)

39
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,860
(Construction in progress)

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,729
It was a three-minute walk
from the mill to the crosswalk.

41
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,229
Not a single car drove into the alley.

42
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,610
It took me about 30 seconds
to cross the road...

43
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,439
and that's how long I stopped looking.

44
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,340
I bought some apples...

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,949
and set my eyes back on the mill
about a minute later.

46
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,110
(5-6 minutes to commit crime,
4 minutes 30 seconds)

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,680
That means the culprit
had two minutes at most.

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,020
(2 minutes at most)

49
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
It's impossible.

50
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,919
To kill a man, burn the server,
and drive away unnoticed...

51
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,659
in under two minutes?

52
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
No.

53
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,729
It's utterly impossible.

54
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,960
(Residents who lose properties
go into debt)

55
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,270
Then...

56
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,370
(No to redevelopment)

57
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,639
That's it.

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,169
The culprit parked at that dead end...

59
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,870
and watched me.

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,240
(Residents who lose properties
go into debt)

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,460
The oil is still wet.

62
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,620
This car just parked here.

63
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,439
My gosh!

64
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,670
Who are you?

65
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,009
I'm a detective.

66
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,180
Do you have cameras at home?

67
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,209
No. My goodness.

68
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,779
Are there any CCTV cameras around here?

69
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,949
Why do you ask?

70
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,720
Who owns this car?

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,120
The people opposite here.

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,189
Was it here during the day?

73
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,290
No, because they drive to work.

74
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,189
I'd like to know if another car...

75
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,199
was parked here during the day.

76
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,529
There was another car here.

77
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,899
- Right here?
- Yes.

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,639
I came out to get some doenjang
to make an early dinner.

79
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,680
A car was parked right outside the gate.

80
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,639
Did you see someone inside?

81
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,209
I only get a glimpse from inside my home.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,149
I don't know if anyone was inside.

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,750
You didn't come outside?

84
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,920
You could've wanted to ask
why they parked here.

85
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,120
Oh, it was a taxi.

86
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,689
- A taxi?
- Yes.

87
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,060
I thought my neighbor had called for one.

88
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,930
(Welcome to Chukbok Mill)

89
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,540
He was such a nice guy.

90
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,310
- What a disaster.
- Poor guy.

91
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Oh, dear.

92
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,620
(Who is the Pilo-dong redevelopment for?)

93
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,829
If the taxi came this way...

94
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,430
(Taxi route)

95
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,329
Did the taxi make a right turn?

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,870
(Pilo-dong site, Mill)

97
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,439
The street ahead is one-way.

98
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,310
(One-way street)

99
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,310
CCTV?

100
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,079
(CCTV)

101
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,250
The camera would've caught him
if he had turned right.

102
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,360
(Pilo-dong site, Mill)

103
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,430
To Pilo-dong.

104
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,069
(To Pilo-dong)

105
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,579
That's the culprit's escape route.

106
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,779
The taxi driver is the culprit...

107
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,579
or at least an accomplice.

108
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,879
If we check the cameras on the main street
that heads to Pilo-dong,

109
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,180
we can identify the culprit.

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,490
Captain Jang.

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,050
Whose case do you think this is?

112
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
Inspector Yoo's.

113
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,990
It has a jurisdiction
and a detective in charge.

114
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,089
Don't you give a crap about seniority now?

115
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you think
the special promotion made you my equal?

116
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,399
Do you really not know
or know and are pretending not to?

117
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,670
This murder. The body
found in Lee Myung Guk's home.

118
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,110
They're all connected
to Park Jun Seo's case.

119
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,139
I'm telling you, Park Jun Seo's case
is no longer a suicide case.

120
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,149
Exactly, you punk.

121
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,480
Whether Park Jun Seo's case
is a suicide case or not.

122
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,589
Whether we'll link this case
to Lee's and investigate at once.

123
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:30,120
That's for me to decide, not you!

124
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,490
Instead of focusing on your drug case,

125
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,490
you dug around mine...

126
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,829
because you wanted the insurance money.

127
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,660
That's why another man ended up dead.

128
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,199
How will you pay for it?

129
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,230
This case is drug-related.

130
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,600
I can't believe what I'm hearing now.

131
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,500
Well? Where?

132
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,240
Where are the drugs?

133
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,769
Oh, over there?

134
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,509
Did you find drugs in there?

135
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,879
Or...

136
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,449
Park Jun Seo, that friend of yours...
Was he a druggie?

137
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,980
You might think...

138
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,649
Park Jun Seo, Lee Myung Guk,
and the mill owner too...

139
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,889
had something
to do with drugs, but I think...

140
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,720
You were always there...

141
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,329
and that's what I think
is the weirdest thing!

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Explain that.

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,360
Explain it, you moron.

144
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,569
How dare you?

145
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:18,769
Hey!

146
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,240

148
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,720
How dare you...

149
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,120
You can't come in without shoe covers.

150
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Detective Min.

151
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,960
Get me some shoe covers.

152
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,500
You think nothing of your seniors.

153
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,870
Are you already back?

154
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Goodness.

155
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,870
Hello. What can I get you?

156
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,870
He wouldn't have brought a weapon.

157
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,809
What great timing.
I just made a new batch.

158
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,210
When the man turned away
to get some rice cakes,

159
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,950
the killer stabbed him in the back
with scissors for the plastic wrap.

160
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Once.

161
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,990
Twice.

162
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:12,789
Thrice.

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,029
That wasn't enough still.

164
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,559
That's why he used the scales.

165
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,059
He didn't aim for the vital points.

166
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,769
So he wasn't that experienced.

167
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,970
A shoe size eight,

168
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,909
about 170cm tall.

169
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,570
But why?

170
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,080
Why did he burn the CCTV server?

171
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,779
To delete what?

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
The taxi driver.

Not at all.

180
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,250
- Take care.
- Bye.

181
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:18,789
Hello.

182
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,690
What took you so long?

Okay.

185
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,230
So, did you take a look?

186
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,669
Will you buy me a drink?

187
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,940
Fine, I will. Tell me already.

188
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:32,870
It was No Gyu Min.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,110
The guy who drove 0233 on February 23.

190
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,370
No Gyu Min?

191
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,940
Who's that? Do you know him?

192
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,610
No, not well.

193
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,710
He joined after you quit.

194
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,480
I only said hi a few times.

195
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,389
Give me his number and address.

196
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,220
Hang on.

197
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,990
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

198
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,429
It's 010-0847...

199
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,830
My gosh.

200
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,600
Hey!

201
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Sorry.

202
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,730
- My bad.
- What the...

203
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,840
- Hello?
- Why? What just happened?

204
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,909
Never mind.
Some psycho almost plowed into me.

205
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,669
Darn it. Give me the number.

206
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Okay.

207
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
There was another car here.

208
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,389
Was Jun Seo's taxi driver the culprit?

209
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,039
I'm the detective you talked to earlier.

210
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,610
Was the taxi parked
outside your home orange?

211
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,570
What? No, it wasn't.

212
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,539
It was silver.

213
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,679
Okay, thanks.

214
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,350
It's a different taxi.

215
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,289
The culprit is another taxi driver.

216
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,419
Hello. Can I ask you something?

217
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,860
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

218
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,990
Hello.

219
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,129
February 23, licence plate 35A0233.

220
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,129
Could you tell me the driver
who was driving at the time?

221
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,570
Just a moment.

222
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,240
(Yoon Mi Ja, Chief of Accounting)

223
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,440
It was No Gyu Min.

224
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,009
What's this about?

225
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,549
The No Gyu Min you just mentioned.

226
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,279
Is he at work right now?

227
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,720
No. He quit yesterday.

228
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,080
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

229
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,620
Do you have his number and address?

230
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:30,889
Yes.

231
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,759
- Shall I write it down for you?
- Yes, please.

232
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,070
Did anyone ask the same question today?

233
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,029
No.

234
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,309
If anyone comes to ask the same thing,

235
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:50,110
please call this number right away.

236
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Okay.

237
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,210
Thank you. Have a good day.

238
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,460
(Sohyun-ro 133)

239
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,500
Is anyone home?

240
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,899
Who's there?

241
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,909
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

242
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,539
Is there a Mr. No Gyu Min here?

243
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,049
- No Gyu Min?
- Yes.

244
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,250
It's the guy who used to live there.
Why?

245
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,519
Did he go somewhere?

246
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,759
He said he was suddenly leaving
the other day,

247
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,129
and when I looked this morning,
he was gone.

248
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,690
By the way,
did he get into some kind of trouble?

249
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,230
Didn't he say where he was going
or anything?

250
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,500
No.

251
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,000
He said to wire him the deposit
once the room gets rented out.

252
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,039
Was there perhaps a car
that Mr. No used to drive?

253
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,350
It seemed like the deposit was
his entire fortune. He didn't have a car.

254
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,419
Should I give you
his phone number, at least?

255
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,250
No, I have his number.

256
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,750
Then,

257
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,220
if he calls about his deposit,

258
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,919
please call me at this number.

259
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,759
Thank you.

260
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:17,460
He hasn't gotten himself
into big trouble, has he?

261
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,129
No.

262
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,230
Darn it.

263
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,100
Why is it so hard to reach you?

264
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,240
Why? What's up?

265
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,909
Hey, I think we were filmed.

266
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,940
- On the CCTV camera at the mill.
- What do you mean?

267
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,679
On the day Jun Seo died.

268
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,350
Early in the morning.
In the alley at Pilo-dong.

269
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,750
There was a CCTV camera there.

270
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,450
What?

271
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,519
- So?
- What do you think?

272
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,190
I took care of it.

273
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,490
"Took care of it?" Took care of what?

274
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,559
You didn't...

275
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,200
Don't worry.

276
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,899
I took good care of it
so it wouldn't cause any trouble.

277
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,809
Where are you right now?

278
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,940
Oh, when I watched the CCTV footage,

279
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,850
a taxi driver dropped Jun Seo off
in that alley.

280
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,450
So, I came to the taxi driver's house.

281
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,279
I was trying to see
if I could get anything, but...

282
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,490
Jae Gyeong got here before us.

283
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,059
Come to Pilo-dong right this instant.

284
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,759
Don't do anything else,
and just come right away.

285
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,529
I told you not to worry.

286
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,929
I think Jae Gyeong didn't get
any leads either.

287
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,500
The taxi driver seems to have disappeared.

288
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,399
So, shall I try looking for him?

289
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,440
Hey!

290
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,669
Stop uttering nonsense
and just come if I tell you to.

291
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,679
Why are you yelling? You startled me.

292
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,509
Okay. I'll be right there.

293
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,649
Should I bring some beer...

294
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,559
(Park Jun Seo)

295
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,789
You'll probably need to take two pills
at a time now.

296
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,690
Don't take them all at once
just because you feel the urge.

297
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,779
I know I'm late.

298
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,650
However,

299
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,450
I'm going to keep trying.

300
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,950
I'll put everything back in order.

301
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,089
How could you do drugs?

302
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,859
Park Jun Seo, Lee Myung Guk,
and the mill owner too...

303
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:09,359
had something
to do with drugs, but I think...

304
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,089
You were always there...

305
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,500
and that's what I think
is the weirdest thing!

306
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,109
(Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan)

307
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:05,049
A murder case occurred near
the site of Park Jun Seo's death.

308
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,319
Please call when you have the time.

309
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,359
(Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan)

310
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,259
- This is Park Tae Jin.
- Hello, Prosecutor Park.

311
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,099
You saw the text I sent you, right?

312
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,430
Yes, what was that about?

313
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,569
We haven't specified a suspect yet.

314
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,200
We're investigating the surrounding area.

315
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:28,170
But the area near the crime scene
is a very quiet alley.

316
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,170
So, what does that have to do with
Park Jun Seo's suicide?

317
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,910
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong was...

318
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,109
investigating Park Jun Seo's suicide
when this happened.

319
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,150
Jang Jae Gyeong is also the person
who reported the case.

320
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,880
- Pardon?
- There was a mill...

321
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,490
in the alley to the site
where Park Jun Seo died.

322
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,059
There was a CCTV camera
underneath the tarp.

323
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,160
The suspect must've found out,
and I think this incident occurred...

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,660
in the process of
getting rid of the footage.

325
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,230
Hello?

326
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,500
Yes, I'm listening.

327
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,099
There was a CCTV camera?

328
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,210
Have you gotten access to the server?

329
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,940
Well, that is...

330
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,140
The suspect burned down the whole server.

331
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,880
We will send it to NFS.

332
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,980
But it has practically melted,

333
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,750
so it might be hard to get anything.

334
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,420
What about Jang Jae Gyeong?

335
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,220
He went somewhere in a hurry
from the site.

336
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,460
I mean, did Jang Jae Gyeong see
that CCTV footage?

337
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,029
He had gone to grab...

338
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,230
a USB flash drive
from his car to get a copy of the server.

339
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,559
That's when the murder occurred.

340
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,900
So, he must not have seen it either.

341
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,339
So, what is it you want to do?

342
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,839
Pardon?

343
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,880
So, this case...

344
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,779
will have to be considered connected
to Park Jun Seo's suicide.

345
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,950
I will have to combine the two cases,
and...

346
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,849
- Look here, Inspector Yoo.
- Yes?

347
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,559
Based on what evidence
will you connect...

348
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,029
Park Jun Seo's suicide
and the murder case at the mill?

349
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,500
Then, are you saying
Park Jun Seo was murdered?

350
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,369
No, I don't mean that, but...

351
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,730
A murder occurred at the mill,

352
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,170
and the suspect destroyed the CCTV
in case his face was caught on camera.

353
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,539
As for the motive, you can look into
those close to the victim...

354
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,440
or see if anything has disappeared.

355
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,009
Oh, right.

356
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,009
Treat this as a separate case.

357
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Also,

358
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,990
Inspector Yoo.
Will you call and text me...

359
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,819
every time there is a new case
in Anhyun City?

360
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,819
No, sir. I'm sorry.

361
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,269
Get up.

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,440
Wipe the floor first.

363
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,950
Are you sure no one saw you?

364
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,319
Yes.

365
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,289
Did you get rid of
your fingerprints and hair?

366
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,400
Yes.

367
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,769
Did you get rid of your hair too?

368
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,039
Chi Hyun, I got rid of everything.

369
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,710
If you went in there
to get rid of the CCTV footage,

370
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,880
why did you kill someone?

371
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,950
All you had to do was scare him
and lock him up.

372
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,890
There was no time.

373
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,519
I had a feeling Jae Gyeong...

374
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,259
would barge in at any moment.

375
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,730
You can't keep causing trouble
or you'll be tracked down.

376
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,730
You should think of your wife
and your kids.

377
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,970
I do.

378
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,970
I do this because I do.
I didn't do it for myself.

379
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,039
I did it for Si Jung, Jong Soo, Tae Jin,

380
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,339
and you.

381
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,779
I'm taking the bullet
so all of our lives can work out.

382
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:30,779
Right?

383
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Am I wrong?

384
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,890
Did Jae Gyeong see us in the footage?

385
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,359
No.

386
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,329
I don't know.

387
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:44,829
But...

388
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,599
I have a feeling he didn't.

389
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,869
But...

390
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,799
how did he know
we passed that road that night?

391
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,670
Also, how did he show up
at Lee Myung Guk's place?

392
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,339
Are you sure you have no idea...

393
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,450
who put Lee Myung Guk's body back?

394
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,880
I told you. I don't know.

395
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,099

(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

398
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,619
He got out here on purpose...

399
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,549
so he would be captured on camera.

400
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,900
This is 25 minutes after he got off.

401
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,430
Why did this car suddenly stop here?

402
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,400

Lieutenant Kim Chang Soo was here.

406
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,819
Did you look through the CCTV footage?

407
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:55,829
I didn't either.

408
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,190

417
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,880
Let's say...

418
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,180
you're married.

419
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,220
I can't afford to get married.

420
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:58,990
Let's just suppose.

421
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,890
You're married,

422
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,960
and your wife cheats on you
with your friend.

423
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,430
If you find out,

424
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:09,069
what would you do?

425
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,470
First, I'll have to see
what my friend is like.

426
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,039
Is he someone I can beat in a fight?

427
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,240
If you were to meet with him,

428
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,910
wouldn't a construction site be good?

429
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Of all places?

430
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,210
And that friend happens to be
a prosecutor.

431
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,079
Then I shouldn't fight him.

432
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,190
Right.

433
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,589
You would probably try
to talk it out at first.

434
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,559
But you'll grow more angry over time.

435
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,759
You'd feel a sense of loss too.

436
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:37,390
And that's why...

437
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,460
it could develop into a fistfight.

438
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
Is that necessary?

439
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,529
After that,

440
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,769
he somehow pushes you off
the ninth floor...

441
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,140
and you die.

442
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,109
Since he's a prosecutor,

443
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,240
he tries to cover up the case.

444
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,640
He performs
the postmortem screening himself...

445
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:55,650
and tries to skip the autopsy.

446
00:27:58,849 --> 00:27:59,849
Don't you think...

447
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:01,849
this story makes sense?

448
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,289
Does it or not?

449
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,730
Well...

450
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,430
That friend of yours who died...
Did he fall from the ninth floor?

451
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,599
- Yes.
- And that friend's wife...

452
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,670
and his prosecutor friend
are having an affair?

453
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,140
Yes.

454
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,509
It smells fishy.

455
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
Doesn't it?

456
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,180
But you need evidence.
Did you find anything?

457
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,049
Do you have any pictures
of their affair or any recordings?

458
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Right.

459
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,220
That's what you need to work on from now.

460
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:39,789

461
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,859
- You're here.
- Yes.

462
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:47,859
Why are you standing? Sit down.

463
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,299
The board meeting is tomorrow,

464
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,500

but you came on your own.

467

such a thick book after so long.

468

469
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,210

471
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,450
then head over to my hideout
to finish reviewing it.

472
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,160
What is it? Did something happen?

473
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,359
Yesterday, someone was murdered
at the mill in front...

474
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,460
of the construction site Jun Seo died.

475
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,460
And?

476
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,630
It seems that mill had a security camera.

477
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,369
What?

478
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,869
What was captured on it?

479
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,039
Luckily, the server was burned down.

480
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Nothing could be salvaged.

481
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,140
But,

482
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,009
Jang Jae Gyeong was there.

483
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,779
What do you mean he was there?

484
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:41,720
He left to get a copy of the server,

485
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,549
someone murdered the mill owner...

486
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,759
and burned the server down.

No.

490
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,170
Are you sure?

491
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:01,869
I told you. I don't know.

492
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:04,269
So what? What happened?

493
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,279

494

The police are investigating.

495
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,019
It will be investigated as...

496
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,119
a homicide by a robber
unrelated to Jun Seo's case.

497

why tell us?

It's awkward to call her this woman
and that woman.

519
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,819
We also shouldn't say her name in public.

520
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,250
Come up with a nickname for her, will you?

521
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,089
All right.

522
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,059
You promise to give me
the 100,000 dollars, right?

523
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,529
Hey.
Don't you think this is more productive...

524

than trying to land an exclusive?

from Anhyun Economic Daily.

542
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,519
I see. What brings you here?

543
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,289
In September of 2023,
someone named Park Bok Rye died...

544
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,119
from a medical accident.

545
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:33,589
You remember it, don't you?

546
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,059
Who?

547
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,160
Park Bok Rye.

548
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,630
I see. Last September?

549
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,599
I don't remember such an incident.

550
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,940
Sir,

551
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,299
I already know everything.

552
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,039
Do you think I came here
without doing some basic research?

553
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,210
I talked to the victim's family already.

554
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,950
I thought of going
straight to the hospital director,

555
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:01,880
but came here first
to give you a chance to talk.

556
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,920
You can say whatever you want,

557
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,359
but it better not be
"I don't know" or "that never happened."

558
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,859
I hate those phrases the most.

559
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,069
Did her son tell you everything?

560
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:19,769
Yes.

561
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,940
Can we talk somewhere else?

562
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,210
Sure.

563
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,650
Hello, director.

564
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,420
When do we get the equipment?

565
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,049
Next month... Let me check.

566

(Oh Yoon Jin, Anhyun Economic Daily)

567
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,829
Next month on the 11th.

568
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,500
I don't think
the builders will be done by then.

569
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,869
Postpone the delivery to fit the schedule.

570
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,970
I'll do that.

571
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,900
Who's this?

572
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,269
She said she was a reporter.

573
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:57,970
I'm Oh Yoon Jin
from Anhyun Economic Daily.

574
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:00,279
Park Bok Rye.

575
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,380
I remember her too.

576
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,450
So many people here must die each day.

577
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,789
Ms. Park must've been a unique case...

578
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,019
if you remember her.

579
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,019
Yes.

580
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,719
It was very unique.

581
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,159
Most people accept it
as fate or the inevitable,

582
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,599
but Ms. Park's son...

583
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,000
blamed the hospital and staff quite a lot.

584
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,670
A patient died because of
a mistaken prescription.

585
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,039
Do you not remember covering that up?

586
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,309
"A mistaken prescription?"

587
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,480
- Yes.
- Do you mean...

588
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,420
instead of what should've been prescribed,

589
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,949
the patient was given something else?

590
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,460
Are you saying I'm wrong?

591
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,030
I talked to the victim's son.

592
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,630
Did he...

593
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,570
mention an injection?

594
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,210
Yes. Of course.

595
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,780
What else would we be talking about?

596
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,679
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
was here last week.

597
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,619
What was their conclusion
on our prescription for injectable drugs?

598
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,519
In the past two years,

599
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,920
we had no problems with injectable drugs.

600
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,159
That includes Park Bok Rye's prescription.

601
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,159
Come on.

602
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,900
- Woonjong Medical Center...
- You must know...

603
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:29,000
there are patients
or mourning relatives...

604
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:30,630
who wish to damage our reputation.

605
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,539
It's a shame.

606
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,210
If anyone wants to talk about this case,

607
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:39,710
be sure to inform me
before you say anything.

608
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Okay.

609
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,150
If you request an official interview,

610
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,050
I'll see you then.

611
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,679
Are there any complaints?

612
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,079
No.

613
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,050
They talked about killing us
for stopping the supply,

614
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,679
but now they're thanking us.

615
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,780
What about the Doctor?

616
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,250
I asked around,

617
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,920
but no one knew about him.

618
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,320
There are almost zero
domestic manufacturers because...

619
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,090
they were all arrested or moved abroad.

620
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,260
I don't know where he came from.

621
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:34,230
There's no trace of him at all.

622
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,769

624
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,639

You know Jung Eun, right?

630
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:05,329
She was wanted too,

631
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,559
but she went to baseball games
and clubs...

632
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,400
and the police took two years to get her.

633
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,400
There's no need to be intimidated.

634
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,139
Being wanted isn't the issue.

635
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,269
If CEO Yoon hears of this,
she might use it...

636
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,909
as an excuse
to deal directly with the Doctor.

637
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,610
No one knows what the Doctor will do
if he hears about it too.

638
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,719
He wouldn't switch.

639
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,150
Let's be careful anyway.

640
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:31,320
Don't do business with new people.
Stick to known contacts.

00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:26,820
but let me say something that others
often say in situations like this.

718
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:29,719
Take care of your own self.

719
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,389
Eat.

720
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,460
Eat up and find your strength...

721
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,260
so we can talk about
what to do from now on.

722
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,969
Have you checked what it says
in this text message?

723
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:47,369
Yes.

724
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
I have.

725
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,909
The victim refuses to say anything.

726
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,139
The hospital director is acting
like he knows nothing.

727
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,980
But I'm sure there's something there.

728
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,280
I'm going to keep digging into this.

729
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
By the way,

730
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,550
I get that Park Jun Seo mentioned...

731
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,920
you, me, and Lee Myung Guk's names...

732
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,360
in his will so that we'd reveal the truth
about his death.

733
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,159
But seriously, what's up with the drugs?

734
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,800
Why would Park Jun Seo have
anything to do with drugs?

735
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,170
If what you say is true,
it means Jun Seo was dealing drugs.

736
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,510
And you...

737
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:33,320
Why did you go back
to the police station last time?

738
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:38,190
The day
Lee Myung Guk's house caught on fire.

739
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,360
You were practically dying,
but you came back here.

740
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,000
There was
a Lemon Mulberry pill here, right?

741
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,969
You came back here to take that pill,
didn't you?

742
00:43:54,969 --> 00:43:55,969
Yes.

743
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,610
Did you take it?

744
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,820
Jae Gyeong.

745
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,019
There was no other way.

746
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:12,489
I just couldn't stop...

747
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,590
then and there.

748
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,860
What will you do
if that situation happens again?

749
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:22,929
Will you take it again?

750
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,630
Yes.

751
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:30,710
(Heo Joo Song)

752
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,179
What?

753
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,210
I just called you for the first time.

754
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,789
Speak.

755
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:45,849
About that company that Jun Seo founded...

756
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,190
Audiophile, Incorporated.

757
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,920
I found the address for that company.

758
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,730
But how should I say this?
It seems rather odd.

759
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,829
I was going to tell Jae Gyeong about this,

760
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:55,530
but I wanted to ask you about it first.

761
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,099
You don't like opening up
all the information to Jae Gyeong.

762
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,469
What should we do?
Should we just check it out ourselves?

763
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,210
Let's hang up for now.

764
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,039
I was suddenly curious
about the address...

765
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,079
of the company that Jun Seo had founded.

766
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,780
But why is it Pilo-dong all of a sudden?

767
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,750
It's not close to Jun Seo's house.

768
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:16,949
I know.

769
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,820
Hey, what did Jun Seo say
when he came to see you?

770
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:23,090
You didn't tell me
when I asked you at the funeral.

771
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,230
What happened 20 years ago,

772
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:26,900
and things that have changed since then...

773
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,429
He said he would put
everything back in order.

774
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,730
By 20 years ago,

775
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,199
did he mean Chae Kyung Tae?

776
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:38,309
Goodness, Jun Seo must've had that
on his mind all these years.

777
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,739
I guess he still felt bad that you were
forced to transfer schools...

778
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,250
because of that incident, right?

779
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,960
(We welcome the development of Pilo-dong.)

780
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,659
(Congratulations on the redevelopment,
and we wish you success.)

781
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,670
(Pilo-dong's architectural designs passed!
Public redevelopment confirmed!)

782
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,280
(Cancel the redevelopment that
the residents did not approve of!)

783
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:20,650
(Who is this redevelopment for?
Cancel authorization for the project!)

784
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,659
Hey, found it.

785
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,500
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it.

786
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Hey.

787
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:39,469
Is it okay...

788
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,039
for a company to have its address
listed in a place like this?

789
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:44,539
Is anyone here?

790
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,510
Is anyone here?

791
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,719
Excuse me.

792
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Gosh, that's hot!

793
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,340
Who are you?

794
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,280
We're not bad people.

795
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,949
- Do you perhaps...
- So, who are you?

796
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:23,949
Park Jun Seo.

797
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,010
You know Park Jun Seo, don't you?

798
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,980
No.

799
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,750
He's dead.

800
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:35,059
How do you know each other?

801
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,699
When?

802
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,099
A few days ago.

803
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:42,800
Are you alone?
Are there any adults around?

804
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:44,369
What's your name?

805
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:51,710
Jang Jae Gyeong.

806
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,280
How do you know that?

807
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Oh Yoon Jin.

808
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,980
Oh, my.

809
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,119
Come with me.

810
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,099
(Min Hyun Woo)

811
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:30,050
What's your name, buddy?

812
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:31,949
Min Hyun Woo.

813
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:33,679
Right?

814
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,420
By the way, how do you know our names?

815
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,519
He said you'd come.

816
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,860
When?

817
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,860
Last time.

818
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,659
Last time, when? How many days ago?

819
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:46,929
About...

820
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,630
ten days ago?

821
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,030
If a guy shows up, it's Jang Jae Gyeong.

822
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:52,630
If a woman shows up, it's Oh Yoon Jin.

823
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,639
I'm Heo Joo Song. Nice to meet you.

824
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:00,880
You're a cop.

825
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,250
And you're a reporter.

826
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,880
You still haven't told us.

827
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
How do you know each other?

828
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,449
We just met in passing.

829
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,159
Didn't he tell you anything else?

830
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,829
Are you here alone?

831
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,559
My grandma is inside.

832
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,130
What?

833
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Grandma.

834
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Hello.

835
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,099
There was a motorcycle outside.

836
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:30,940
- Do you do deliveries?
- Yes.

837
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:33,239
- What do you deliver?
- Just anything.

838
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Do you deliver drugs too?

839
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,380
What?

840
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,079
No.

841
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,650
They just look like regular pills.
Yellow ones.

842
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,980
Haven't you ever delivered those before?

843
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,320
I said I haven't.

844
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,619
Have you heard of someone
called Lee Myung Guk?

845
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,489
No.

846
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,559
Oh, I see.

847
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,030
Then, you must've had a huge pig farm.

848
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,530
Of course.

849
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:02,369
This whole area used to be a pig farm.

850
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,539
You see that commercial building
down there, right?

851
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,539
Yes.

852
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,880
That whole spot used to be a pig farm.

853
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,010
Our pig farm.

854
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,480
You must've made some money
for land compensation.

855
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,079
Hyun Woo's dad...

856
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:17,320
sold it too early.

857
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,590
He was tricked.

858
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,590
Why?

859
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,489
We had no idea they were building
a new town.

860
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,489
Goodness.

861
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,800
These are newly harvested chestnuts,
aren't they?

862
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,869
They're tasty.

863
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,840
They're not newly harvested.

864
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:38,869
By the way, you could live somewhere else.

865
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,510
Why did you come somewhere
with so many hills? It must be hard.

866
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,039
Where else would we go?

867
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,679
This is where we used to live.

868
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,119
After being pushed out to live here,

869
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,650
I used to farm produce to sell them.

870
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,690
I'm too old now.

871
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,429
I noticed the name Min Seung Wook
on your gate.

872
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,590
Is that your husband's name?

873
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
No, my son's.

874
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:04,769
Is he out?

875
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,969
I don't know why he rushed to leave.

876
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,079
That's enough. It's too tiring.

877
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,679
- I'm okay.
- You should stop.

878
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,280
I'm having fun. I enjoy it.

879
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,380
Gosh.

880
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,619
Are those chestnuts?

881
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,559
Anyway,
Mr. Park hasn't been here in a while.

882
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,289
His friends are just as handsome.

883
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,360
- Am I handsome?
- Gosh.

884
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,730
Mr. Park...

885
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,269
is a good man.

886
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:43,000
He always helps us when we're in need.

887
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,440
He's good to Hyun Woo too.

888
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,210
Gosh.

889
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,139
Why didn't he come with you?

890
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,449
- Well...
- Well...

891
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,949
- He passed away.
- What?

892
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,719
I'm a detective.

893
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,820
This is the address of his company
he left behind.

894
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,760
I came to confirm it.

895
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,199
Wait. Hold on...

896
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,840
What is he talking about?

897
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,599
Let's go.

898
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:18,909
- What is he talking about?
- I'll visit again.

899
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,280
What?

900
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,139
Hold on a minute.

901
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,780
- Jae Gyeong.
- Hey!

902
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,420
Hey!

903
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,519
Did you have to say that now?

904
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,719
She can find out about it later.

905
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,989
Are you rubbing it in or something?

906
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,690
Does it make you happy
to tell her that way?

907
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,460
Then when should I tell her?

908
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,059
She can hear it from him,

909
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,500
or it might come up later
and she hears about it.

910
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,570
You should look at the situation
and do it when she's ready.

911
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,300
No problem in this world waits
for the right time...

912
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,699
or for people to be ready.

913
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,039
I'm here as a detective.

914
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:54,480
Also, she's not Jun Seo's family.

915
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,480
I don't have the time right now.

916
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,309
I can't waste time
without gaining anything...

917
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,119
after coming up all the way here.

918
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,719
Fine.

919
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,619
You're right.
Nothing waits for the right time...

920
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,019
or for people to be ready.

921
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:09,360
I work in insurance.
I know that better than you.

922
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:13,159
But how are you always so busy?
You always have to have it your way,

923
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,630
and you don't consider everyone else.

924
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,530
Sorry to bring this up,
but you did this when Chae Kyung Tae died.

925
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,730
You did the same thing to Jun Seo.

926
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,840
It's not easy to betray a close friend.

927
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,409
Why were you so inconsiderate
of Jun Seo's situation?

928
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,309
If you had given him some time,

929
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,050
we would have never parted,
and you wouldn't have transferred schools.

930
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:44,690
Park Jun Seo, that fool.

931
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,460
What is he trying to put back in order?

932
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,659
It's meaningless.

933
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:06,949
Hey.

934
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,519
Call me if anything happens.

935
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,989
Do you have a motorcycle insurance?

936
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,860
- No.
- Make sure you get one.

937
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,960
Always wear a helmet,
and don't skip school.

938
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,099
I'll kill you
if you make your grandma worry.

939
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,250
Anyway, tell them to sell it
while I'm offering a proper price.

940
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,559
If things don't go his way,
my husband will low-ball the land price.

941
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,090
All right.

942
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:52,230
You should give me one more.

943
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,630
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

944
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,420
It has been long
since the three of us got together.

945
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,590
- How about some drinks?
- Drop me off over there.

946
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:24,889
Bye. I'll call you.

947
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,730
- Gosh.
- What?

948
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,699
Hey. I know you were mad,

949
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,300
but why did you bring up Jun Seo?

950
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:34,769
Don't you know it pushes his buttons...

951
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,170
when we bring up Chae Kyung Tae
from 20 years ago?

952
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,769
He's so inconsiderate,
and he always does things his way.

953
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,480
How much longer do we have to stand it?

954
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,840
Even so.

955
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:44,250
On top of that, he's not well.

956
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,550
What's wrong with him?

957
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,550
He looks fine to me.

958
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,780
I'm the one who's aching everywhere.

959
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:51,849
Hey.

960
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:54,159
Drop me off at the nearest subway station.

961
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:57,230
I thought you wanted to have dinner.

962
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:58,630
I meant the three of us together.

963
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,599
I was suggesting we eat together.

964
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:02,429
Why would I have dinner with you?

965
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,349
What?

966
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,920
What?

967
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:31,230
(Oeseong Station)

968
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,199
Jang Jae Gyeong showed up
at CW's place.

969
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,369
Jang Jae Gyeong?

970
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,099
What is "CW?"

971
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:00,389
What?

972
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,420
It was a long time ago,

973
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,389
but some guy came...

974
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:06,900
and asked to watch
the CCTV like you, detective.

975
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,159
He asked if he could get a copy.

976
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,269
So, I told him to go ahead.

977
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,570
Here.

978
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:15,400
Is that man in this photo?

979
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,440
Hang on.

980
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,539
It was this guy.

981
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:21,079
Oh, right.

982
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,679
This was the man who got out of
the taxi in the CCTV footage too, right?

983
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:26,409
I knew I had seen him somewhere before.

984
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,050
It was this man.
The man who got a copy of the video.

985
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,690
Hello.

986
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,230
What brings you here?

987
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,530
If it's okay, may I come in?

988
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,099
I need to look for something
as a part of the investigation.

989
00:57:51,739 --> 00:57:52,769
Come in.

990
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,039
Please excuse me.

991
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,050
Thank you.

992
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,519
- Would you like some tea?
- No, I'm okay.

993
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,559
Is there a computer, a laptop,

994
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:15,300
or a flash drive he used to use?

995
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:19,170
There is a laptop
and a couple of flash drives.

996
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,800
Please wait a moment.

997
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,260
(Park Jun Seo)

998
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,219
- Good job.
- Look over here.

999
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,090
- Mom.
- Mom.

1000
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,260
Mom!

1001
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,059
Hi, Mom.

1002
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,760
There are so many, right?

1003
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,300
Yes, these are scissors.

1004
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:01,769
Yoon Hee, say hi to Mom.

1005
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:03,239
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, Mom.

1006
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,510
Give me a kiss.

1007
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,639
Yes!

1008
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:14,820
You're eating so well.

1009
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:16,880
What are you looking for?

1010
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,320
It's nothing special.

1011
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,619
It looks like you're searching
for a video.

1012
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,389
It won't take long.

1013
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:39,469
Yoon Jin, over here.

1014
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,420
- Is he still in there?
- Yes.

1015
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:51,989
By the way,

1016
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:53,489
what is "CW?"

1017
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,860
"C" is for cheating...

1018
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,690
because she is a cheating...

1019
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,760
- Woman?
- Yes.

1020
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,860
- Nice nickname.
- Thanks.

1021
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,429
I wonder why he came here at this hour.

1022
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,500
I'm not sure.

1023
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:12,539
Thank you for your time.

1024
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,780
I guess you couldn't find
what you were looking for.

1025
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,050
No, it was helpful.

1026
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:21,650
- Bye.
- Bye.

1027

1028
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:01,590
Chae Kyung Tae, that punk.

1029
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,690
His funeral...

1030
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,929
is tomorrow.

1031
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,059
If you want to attend it,

1032
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:12,199
let the class president know.

1033
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:16,739
Class president, put together
a list of names and bring it to me.

1034
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,570
Class president.

1035

1036
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,380
Yes.

01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:28,820
Gosh. You punk...

(No Gyu Min)

1039
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,920
I know it's true. You went
to Kyung Tae's that day!

1040
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,329
I told you I didn't!

1041
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,960
Jun Seo, we're friends.

1042
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,630
Why are you hiding it from me?

1043
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:45,070
You can't focus in class.

1044
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:48,340
Whenever Yoon Jin and I talk to you,
you're out of it and talk in gibberish.

1045
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,840
Kyung Tae's place caught on fire...

1046
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:56,210
and he died,
but it wasn't an accident, was it?

1047
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:58,579
What happened?

1048
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,880
Who was there? What did you see?

1049
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,880
I don't know!

1050
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:02,519
I told you, no.

1051
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:05,449
What do you know?

Darn it.

1058
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,780
I don't want to be an adulterer
who fools around with married men.

Let's get a divorce.

1060
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,909
Are you hiding something
from me these days?

1061
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,420
Are you telling me
to ignore the chairman's opinion?

1062
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,019
Won Jong Soo,
show us what you've got.

What are you doing?

1066
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:16,920
I said, what are you doing?

1067
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,760
I know you don't dare touch
the people you should sue.

Who are you threatening to sue?

You said you haven't had the drug
in a week.

How did you hold out?

1071
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:25,730
If you relax your throat for a second,

1072
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,070
you get a surge of air.
