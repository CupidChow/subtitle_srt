we were in Audiophile...

116
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,240
so we're asking neighbors if they have...

117

anything on their dashboard cameras.

118
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,080
It would've been hard
to move the body alone,

119
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,580
so there must be a trace.

120
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,889
The killing, freezing,
and burying of the body...

121
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,389
would've been done by the same person.

123
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,559
and put him back at home...

124
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,200
would be someone else.

00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,100
dug him up days later

134

it was Lee Myung Guk's body?

What do you have
that made you suspect it was him?

141
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,509
I mentioned a source within the police.

142
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,840

as an exclusive on a murder?

143
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,610

your police friend and add that?

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,899
- Instead of mentioning a source.
- No way.

150
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,830
He's the type to sue us both...

151
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,970
because I said "source within the police."

that you didn't have enough.

00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,840
I think...

187
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,710
Chang Soo viewed the security footage
but didn't sign in either.

188
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,710
(CCTV Footage Access Ledger)

189
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,710
Why?

190
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,379
Does he know I'm addicted to drugs?

191
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:33,379
You told me to be here by 7:20 a.m.

192
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,990
My phone shows
I texted Chang Soo on Sunday night,

193
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,759
but I have no memory of that.

194
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,190
It's very possible
to access my phone with my print...

195
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,399
and fake a text.

196
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,669
What if someone used my phone
to text Chang Soo...

197
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,570
and had him come not to Jeonghoon...

198
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,299
where the delivery was scheduled...

199
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,740
but to Anhyun City Hall,
the station before?

200
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:57,809
Who was it?

201
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,309
Who on earth left me at car exit 3-4...

202
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,580
at Anhyun City Hall Station?

203
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,220
And why did they call Chang Soo?

204
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,919
Did he know everything...

205
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,750
before he came to wake me at 7:20 a.m.?

206
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,919
Also,

207
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,330
the only person I told that I'd found
a body at Lee Myung Guk's...

208
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,330
was Chang Soo.

209
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,799
Write down this address.

210
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,470
Inhyun-ro, Jangsoo-dong, Anhyun.

211
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,440
It's 63-38, 973.

212
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,240
Shortly after the call with Chang Soo...

213
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,240
the Molotov cocktails flew in.

214
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,610
It was the master bedroom too.

215
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,639
Right where I happened to be.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,669
Captain.

217
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:01,940
- Hey.
- Do you need something?

218
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
No.

219
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,250
(Anhyeon Police Station)

220
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,250
(5:10 p.m., Monday, February 26, 2024)

221
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,230
(5:10 p.m., Monday, February 26, 2024)

222
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,629
(Medical Area A)

223
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,110
You still haven't found anything?

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,750
Why is it taking so long to see
if there was a medical accident...

225
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,950
at Woonjong Medical Center last year?

226
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:46,549
Yoon Jin.

227
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,220
Do you think that little of me?

228
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,120
What is it now?

229
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,659
You told me to be thick-faced...

230
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,960
and scared me into
finishing the investigation by today.

231
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,529
And today, you suddenly want me
to drop it to do something else.

232
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,860
If you keep this up,

233
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,070
I'll burn out sooner than expected.

234
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,970
Who will you work with if I quit?

235
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,169
I'm sorry, okay?

236
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,809
What's going on?

237
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,409
Give me a reason I can understand.

238
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,480
This morning...

239
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,409
I met Seo Eun, the couple's daughter.

240
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Let's do something else.

241
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,289
Of the medical accidents
at Woonjong Medical Center,

242
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,100
the most recent one was three years ago.

243
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,730
The patient is someone else.

244
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,429
Then the accident from last September.

245
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,629
Only we know about it?

246
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,580
Hello.

247
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,679
Hello.

248
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,120
- Who are you?
- Is this...

249
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,389
where Park Bok Rye lives?

250
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,500
That's my mother.

251
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,900
I see.

252
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,630
When she was being treated
at Woonjong Medical Center,

253
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,240
I heard there was an accident
with her medication.

254
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,309
Said who?

255
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:18,940
You don't need to know who told us.

256
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,410
We'd like to talk to you about it.

257
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,450
Could we go inside...

258
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,750
I don't know about that.

259
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,519
Go away.

260
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,920
Your mother might have passed,

261
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,190
but don't you feel wronged?

262
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:34,829
- Hey.
- Wait.

263
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,690
Can't you tell us about it?

264
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,660
If we run the story,
the hospital will compensate you...

265
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,799
Should we have bought some snacks?

266
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,700
Is he upset we came empty-handed?

267
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,369
Let's ring the doorbell again.

268
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,210
We should change tactics.

269
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
What?

270
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,390
Yoon Jin. What are you up to?

271
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,559
I'm working.

272
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:07,960
Speak fast. I'm busy.

273
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,529
Are you free at 5:30 p.m. today?

274
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,630
No.

275
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,200
Ji Yeon called at around lunchtime today.

276
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:17,769
Choi Ji Yeon?

277
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,339
She wanted to ask me something
and invited me to her place.

278
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,509
She told me to come at 5:30 p.m.

279
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,140
It would be weird
to visit her alone at that time.

280
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,710
The sun sets pretty early nowadays.

281
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,549
If she called you,
it'd be about the insurance.

282
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,950
Go on your own.

283
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,779
I asked if it was about the insurance
and she said no.

284
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,289
Still, you should go
and hear what she has to say.

285
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,460
This just means that
you don't seem that threatening enough...

286
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,390
to call you even when she's alone.

287
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,660
Just think of it as a compliment.

288
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,359
Okay.

289
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,359
Bye.

290
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,369
- Let's go.
- Okay.

291
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,210
Who did you get the pills from at first?

292
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,410
At first,

293
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,680
a friend's senior gave them to me.

294
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,519
What's this senior's name?

295
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:07,579
I don't know his name.
He just told me to call him Senior.

296
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,319
- And your friend?
- My friend?

297
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,890
My friend went back to America.
That punk is American.

298
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,289
You have that senior's number, right?

299
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:16,829
Yes, sir.

300
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,829
You have Kang Min Ho's phone, right?
Give it to me.

301
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,230
Here you go.

302
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,400
Call him.

303
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,940
Say that you need pills now.

304
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,970
Let's see that senior's face.

305
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Well...

306
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,710
I don't think he'd answer...

307
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,720
my call.

308
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,180
Call him until he does.

309
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,589
You'll have to prove if that senior
really gave you the pills.

310
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,619
If I prove it,

311
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,619
you really have to help me.

312
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,930
Okay.

313
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:50,890
Gosh, you're lying.

314
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,259
You didn't even give me
the pill last time.

315
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,900
What does this guy look like?

316
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,769
Something like his height
or any characteristics.

317
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,140
Senior?

318
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,670
There's nothing much that stands out.

319
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:04,940
He's just about average height.

320
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,549
He had a tattoo on his finger.

321
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,490
A tattoo of what?

322
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,599
Jin Wook.

323
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,839
That Doctor guy is so weird, isn't he?

324
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,279
How does he know to release the pills
right before people start to croak?

325
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,279
It was going to be released like this,
but I got so scared.

326
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,819
It's not the Doctor.

327
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,089
What?

328
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,160
I couldn't hold back and called first.

329
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,500
Doctor.

330
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,029
It's me.

331
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,700
I'm sorry I called first...

332
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,539
It must've been bearable for everyone,
seeing how you're only calling now.

333
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,210
Let's start selling again.

334
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,940
How much do you need now?

335
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,640
I need 1,000 by today.

336
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Fine.

337
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,349
(End call)

338
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,650
The altered voice was the same,
but the speech pattern changed.

339
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,450
And it seems like he didn't know...

340
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,259
that I went against the rule
that I'm not supposed to call first.

341
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:29,529
Then,

342
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,630
what happened here?

343
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,170
We'll have to wait and see.

344
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:40,339
(Oh Soo Hyun)

345
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,420
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

346
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,400
- Captain.
- Yes.

347
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,599
I got the CCTV footage from
around Lee Myung Guk's house.

348
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,569
- Where do you want to watch it?
- Let's watch it at my desk.

349
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Okay, just a moment.

350
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,519
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

351
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,420
The kids who were brought in yesterday.
There was one Lemon Mulberry pill left.

352
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,960
- Yes?
- It disappeared.

353
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,890
Look for it again.

354
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,730
I put it in my desk drawer
for a brief moment...

355
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,930
while writing up their case reports.

356
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,230
Are you sure?

357
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,269
Well, so... You can't leave
evidence in your desk drawer.

358
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Darn it.

359
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,470
I know. What should I do?

360
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,369
I'd be dead if Captain finds out, right?

361
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,480
Did you draw blood from those kids
and ask for the analysis?

362
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,240
Yes, we're waiting for the results.

363
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,279
Come here.

364
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,450
So, Captain.

365
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,019
Yes?

366
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,220
There's something we have to tell you.

367
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,690
What is it?

368
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,529
You know those kids yesterday?
The ones fighting over the Lemon Mulberry.

369
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:11,259
Yes?

370
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,759
Soo Hyun was writing up
the report on them,

371
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,900
and it was a hassle to take it to and from
the evidence locker.

372
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,440
So, she put it in her desk drawer,
but it disappeared.

373
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,269
I thought you came here because you knew.

374
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,109
Lieutenant Kim Chang Soo was here.

375
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,650
Kim Chang Soo, what are you trying to do?

376
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:31,819
It disappeared?

377
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,150
What does that mean?

378
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,690
I'm sorry, sir.

379
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,619
It'd be one thing
if it got crushed up and disappeared.

380
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,630
That's an illegal drug.

381
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,390
If it just disappeared,
it could be abused.

382
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,859
Why did you manage it like that?

383
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,769
- That's true, but...
- No. No "buts."

384
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,809
Did you look through the CCTV footage?

385
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,410
No, sir.

386
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,279
I didn't either. Sorry, sir.

387
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,220
Did you get blood from the suspects?

388
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:10,890
I did.

389
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,460
And I requested for blood analyses.

390
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:16,630
Then,

391
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,500
change the records
so that it says there was no evidence.

392
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,940
We can't hand it over
to the prosecution...

393
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,940
saying we lost something
that exists in the records.

394
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,710
Is there any other way?

395
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,140
- No, sir.
- Be careful from now on.

396
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,849
I'll report this to the Unit Chief myself.

397
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,609
Sorry, sir.

398
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,519
I'll make sure this never happens again.

399
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,150
Soo Hyun, you can go.

400
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,789
- You wanted to watch the CCTV footage.
- Oh, right.

401
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,799
Turn it on.

402
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Yes, sir.

403
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,240
Couldn't he just be pretending
not to know?

404
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,440
In case it puts me in an awkward spot,

405
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,809
he could just be letting it slide
as if he doesn't know.

406
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,119
The cars that left from near the house
around the time of the fire...

407
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,390
was this compact vehicle and this SUV.

408
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,990
The car in the back is my friend's car.

409
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,859
And I was riding in it.

410
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,690
Yes, sir.

411
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,599
Aren't you curious why I escaped
in a hurry from that crime scene?

412
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,029
I am curious.

413
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,029
I called because I was curious,
but you didn't answer.

414
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,799
I just assume you must have
some reason for it.

415
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,509
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

416
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,640
Did you perhaps get CCTV footage
from Sunkwang General Hospital?

417
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,779
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

418
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,319
Just as a formality.

419
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,789
But how did you know that, Captain?

420
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,259
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

421
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,359
I called them
because I wanted to take a look too.

422
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,900
But they said they sent it to you.

423
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,170
Yes, sir.

424
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Go on.

425
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,970
Yes, sir.

426
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:12,440
If you watch,

427
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,309
the compact vehicle in front
has tape over the license plates.

428
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,509
It's hard to track it down.

429
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
No.

430
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
It's not right.

431
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,789
Circumstances are too weird
for him to be covering up for me.

432
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,089
Could he have been bought out recently?

433
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,559
If so, who was it?

434
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,789
I think the driver was aware of the CCTV
as he drove home.

435
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,130
There is a CCTV from another angle.

436
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,869
From there,
we can see the vehicle clearly,

437
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,640
but it's also hard to see the driver.

438
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,839
Which way is he driving towards?

439
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,269
It connects to Yanghoon-ro.

440
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,940
Then, check the CCTVs from
near Yanghoon-ro...

441
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,849
and keep tracking where that car
is heading to.

442
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,819
Yes, but the time period is rush hour.

443
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,089
Still, Yanghoon-ro would have
lots of CCTV cameras.

444
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:56,990
If we check from several angles,
we'd be able to track the movements.

445
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,490
That's true,

446
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,559
but these are black-and-white cameras,
and headlights in the dark...

447
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,059
Just do as you're told!

448
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,460
- You're here.
- Yes, hello.

449
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,430
- Come in.
- Okay.

450
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:37,960
I bought these on my way here.

451
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,730
Oh, thank you.

452
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,299
- Do you like oranges?
- Yes.

453
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,569
I'm sorry to call you over
when you must be busy.

454
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:45,569
No.

455
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,900
I just had a meeting end
right around here.

456
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,210
I came too early, didn't I?

457
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,240
No, I got home early today too.

458
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,740
Oh, would you like some tea?

459
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,380
Yes, anything is fine.

460
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,690
Goodness.

461
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,460
My husband used to love listening
to music.

462
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,089
Right.

463
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,730
We were
in the same music listening club...

464
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,730
when we were in high school.

465
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,799
I see.

466
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,069
Right. Why did you call me?

467
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,440
It's about my husband.

468
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,339
I'm not familiar with his finances,
accounts, or insurance.

469
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,109
I heard there was a way
to review all of them at once.

470
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Yes, there is.

471
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,079
It's called One-stop Service
for Safe Inheritance.

472
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,549
All you have to do is apply.

473
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,049
Do you have a laptop?

474
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,519
You can do it right now.

475
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,859
Yes. My husband's laptop must be around.

476
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,720
Good.
Why didn't you just ask me over the phone?

477
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,759
The ward office can do it for you too.

478
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,960
I actually have more to discuss with you.

479
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,369
Go ahead.

480
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,630
Actually,

481
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,400
it was too hectic during the funeral
for me to realize,

482
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,339
but I thought about it,

483
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,779
and this is about my husband,

484
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,509
not some stranger.

485
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,410
Right.

486
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,049
If he signed up for insurance,
he must have paid it too.

487
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,589
When you think about it,
that money comes from us.

488
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,890
Yes.

489
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,619
I don't know the reason,

490
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:50,059
but he left his life insurance money...

491
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,859
to Jae Gyeong and Yoon Jin instead of me.

492
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,859
I think his purpose is clear.

493
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,529
One of them is a detective,

494
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,339
and the other is a reporter.

495
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,109
My husband must have left some bait...

496
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,809
hoping someone would uncover
the truth behind his death.

497
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:07,180
"Bait?"

498
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,609
I heard he wasn't that close
to the two of them.

499
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,589
He left them five million dollars
instead of me.

500
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:18,289
It's definitely a bait.

501
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,660
In the end, I feel like he's leaving
the money to me.

502
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,769
That's why I can't just sit and watch.

503
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,529
I should know how it progresses.

504
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:33,769
Unlike them,

505
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,839
there is no conflict of interest
in your case.

506
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,910
If you find out anything,

507
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,180
please let me know.

508
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,710
Sure.

509
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,079
I'll go grab the laptop.

510
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,079

when I told you to.

and he was found as a corpse.

- What?

You better not tell me not to worry.

to worry about?

Lee Myung Guk being found dead...

538
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,539
is not as bad as compared
to having him missing.

539
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,710
To put it bluntly,

540
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,779
this can be much cleaner...

541
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,480
than having him suddenly show up
without notice.

542
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,980
It's simple.

543
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,490
A fire kills a researcher
from Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

544
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,890
That's it.

545
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Don't worry about it.

546
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,099
What is it?

547
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,910
Take a look.

548
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,279
(Pilo-dong Development Plan
Development Project Overview)

549
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,519
The view is always so nice here.

550
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,960
(Type of project: Land development)

551
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,460
To me and the rest of us,

552
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,789
turning you into the chairman
of Keumhyung Group is our priority.

553
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,730
Jun Seo is gone,

554
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,529
but our friendship will never die.

555
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:52,140
I also have full trust
in you becoming the chairman.

556
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,809
So, Jong Soo.

557
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,279
Don't let this petty incident
get us anxious...

558
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,680
or upset.

559
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,159
How is it going...

560
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,730
with the funding?

561
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,360
I'll have to discuss this with Yigu Group.

562
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,829
Keumhyung can't handle it alone.

563
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,769
I'll announce it this Friday
at the board meeting...

564
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,769
and wrap up the funding plan.

565
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,969
It sounds like
you might need additional funding...

566
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,039
from external organizations
or private investors.

567
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,809
Why do you ask?
Do you have someone in mind?

568
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,820
Well, I think someone might be interested.

569
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,179
Hey.

570
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,019
They need to invest ten million dollars
at the minimum.

571
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,320
Are you thinking
of your senior prosecutors...

572
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,719
whose wives come from rich families?

573
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,690
Come on, Tae Jin.

574
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,630
When it comes to a project like this,

575
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,429
only those who can afford
to lose ten million dollars can play...

576
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,699
such a betting game.

577
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,900
Someone needs to tell them their place.

578
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,739
They should focus
on working for the state...

579
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:04,440
instead of wasting their time.

580
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:06,239
I wasn't referring to them.

581
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,809
If someone has ten million dollars
in cash,

582
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,909
I thought you might include them
regardless of who they were.

583
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,250
I was only asking
if you might be interested.

584
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,590
Don't overact.

585
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,820
Is that so?

586
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,329
How about this?

587
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,230
If they bring me ten million dollars...

588
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,960
and lower their head to beg me,
I'll think about it.

589
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,210
Detective Park.

590
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,309
Did you manage to get the CCTV footage...

591
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:41,809
from around the building
where Park Jun Seo died?

592
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,250
- I did.
- May I look at them too?

593
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,920
Please ask Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan first,

594
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,219
and I'll show them to you.

595
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:50,489
Detective Park.

596
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,519
Don't you find it strange too?

597
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,320
The prosecutor was against conducting
an autopsy.

598
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,489
Inspector Yoo is also uninterested
in investigating the case.

599
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,360
- It's not because of the insurance...
- Excuse me!

600
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,099
I don't know anything about this...

601
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,130
nor do I care.

602
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,469
We couldn't find anything.

603
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,280
You couldn't find anything
from the construction site's cameras?

604
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Detective Park!

605
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:20,579

of the subway drug dealer.

Yes.

611

Turn on the computer.

612
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,730

and put them in the electronic wallet.

614
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,469
The drugs will be shipped the next day.

615
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:53,039
Collect the payment
for yesterday's shipment.

616
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,980

618
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,679
That's all. Take care.

619
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,789
Wait. Just a moment, Doctor.

620
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:06,519
Yes.

621
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,590
May I...

622
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,530
contact you at this number?

623
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,429
If there's an emergency like last time.

624
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,670
You can call me...

625
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,070
just once after midnight.

626
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,510
I understand.

627
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,050
I told you not to come...

628
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,199
Tell me.

629
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,360
What's the password?

630
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,300
I'll ask you just one more time.

631
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,739
Tell me the password now.

632
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:33,780
What's the password?

633
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,849
Tell me right now!

634
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,900
Ji Yeon. Tell me quick.

635
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,309
That's how you and I both
can escape this situation.

636
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:05,909
What situation?

637
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,980
That we were in it together?

638
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,579
What?

639
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,280
Do you want me gone now?

640
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:17,090
Your group of friends.

641
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,360
You thought you were
the best and closest there were.

642
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:21,690
Look at you now.

643
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,289
The money might go to someone else now.

644
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:26,800
Why did you ask for an autopsy?

645
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,960
You shouldn't have taken me
to the police station.

646
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,579
Give me a million dollars.

647
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,150
- What?
- Give me a million dollars,

648
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,289
and I'll tell you.

649
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,630
You don't want your friends to know...

650
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,159
that we slept around.

651
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:04,900
Would they let you off?

652
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,199
So many of them adore Jun Seo...

653
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,900
and still call him "class president."

654
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,579
You slept with your friend's widow.

655
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,480
Who knows?

656
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:21,019
What if that's why Jun Seo died?

657
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,590
- Shut your mouth!
- Don't shout!

658
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,659
You said you wouldn't
leave your wife for me.

659
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,030
Give me something
if you want to silence me.

660
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,699
Isn't that how things work?

661
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,980
(Pilo Town House Construction Site)

662
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Why was it this construction site?

663
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,369
There are two construction sites...

664
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:12,469
within 500m of Jun Seo's home and work.

665
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,909
They weren't by large roads
and would've been easier to sneak into.

666
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,840
Why would he avoid cameras
just to come here?

667
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,719
Hello.

668
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:31,019
It's pretty cold.

669
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,690
I'm from Anhyeon Police Station.

670
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,090
Where's the site manager?

671
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,030
I'm the site manager.

672
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,559
The police investigated
and cleared the site.

673
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:42,929
I'm aware of that.

674
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,099
I'm looking into it again.

675
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,039
Do you have cameras around the site?

676
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,369
We don't.

677
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,539
You have cameras everywhere
in case people steal building materials.

678
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:55,909
We have a camera at the gate for that.

679
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,780
There's no room for cameras
at the actual site.

680
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,320
Let's see the footage
for the camera at the gate, then.

681
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,090
Where do I go? Can I see that here?

682
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:06,059
Well...

683
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,670
Where's the other entrance?

684
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,039
We have just this one gate.

685
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,039
So many people...

686
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,139
steal scrap metal and wires
from construction sites these days.

687
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,650
We made sure
not even a rat could sneak in.

688
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,349
Was the main gate locked
the day the body was found?

689
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,750
Yes. I unlocked it myself
the next morning.

690
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,760
How did the dead guy get in, then?

691
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,860
- What?
- You said not even a rat could sneak in.

692
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,289
If the gate was locked...

693
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,500
and the camera showed
no one went in or out,

694
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:48,199
how did the dead guy get in?

695
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:50,969
How would I know?

696
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,969
The police said it looked like
he came in through the building next door.

697
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,969
Do people scale walls to sneak into
a building next door to kill themselves?

698
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,539
When the police were here,
did they actually watch this footage?

699
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,710
- Yes.
- Then let's go.

700
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,449
- What?
- Come to the station.

701
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:07,679
Let's write up another report
and investigate again.

702
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,820
Why are you doing this, detective?

703
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,659
- Can I drink this?
- Yes, of course.

704
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,289
We had to stop working for days
because of that investigation.

705
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,329
We're having a really hard time right now.

706
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,829
There's another entrance, isn't there?

707
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
(No to redevelopment.
Don't plunder our private property!)

708
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,969
We'd made a small entrance
so the workers...

709
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,110
could come and go at mealtimes.

710
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,809
I guess he came in through here.

711
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,420
Not many people know this place.

712
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,690
Can I go now?

713
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,349
(Construction in progress)

714
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,360
Yes.

715
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,900
(No to redevelopment.
Don't plunder our private property!)

716
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,900
That's blocked now.

717
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,199
(Mill and Rice Cakes)

718
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,079
So you're a policeman.

719
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:13,150
Did people use that entrance often?

720
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:14,579
You bet.

721
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,849
Everyone used it at lunchtime.

722
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,050
But something happened a few days ago.

723
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,460
They blocked it up after that.

724
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,590
- How much do I owe you?
- Just ten dollars.

725
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,230
Here you go.

726
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,730
- Did the police come by?
- No.

727
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:33,840
I thought they didn't see the need
since it was a suicide.

728
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,440
But you're here now.

729
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:39,940
Where is that camera?

730
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,710
Under the eaves.

732
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,989
(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

733
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,679
Can I see the footage from the camera?

734
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,480
From February 23 if possible.

735
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,150
It's your lucky day.

736
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:18,880
I was going to delete the old stuff.

737
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,869
- Yoon Jin.
- Where are you?

738
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,599
I'm on the way home.

739
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:44,809
What?

740
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,510
You said you'd be at Jun Seo's
at 5:30 p.m.

741
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,579
I left because we were done.

742
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,090
I hurried over
to see how Ji Yeon was doing.

743
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:59,760
Then I'll come back.

744
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,360
No, don't bother. Why would you do that?

745
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,630
Why did she...

746
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,360
want to see you?

747
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,369
She asked about
Jun Seo's insurance and inheritance.

748
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,869
- She...
- Wait.

749
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:13,570
I'll call you back.

750
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,050
Shoot.

751
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,510
Darn it.

752
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,469
Darn it.

753
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,679
(A happy change, a new Anhyun)

754
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,400
Please stop for a second.

755
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,269
I'll take a photo of the license plate.

756
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:56,909
Please play it again.

757
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:03,579
One second.

758
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,690
Jun Seo, why on earth did you come here?

759
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:28,800
What do you have to do with drugs?

760
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,710
Could you play it once again?

761
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,190
That was at 10:56 p.m.

762
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:48,460
The estimated time of death was
between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m.

763
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,489
But he arrived
at the scene 30 minutes earlier.

764
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Why?

765
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,630
Would you like to watch more?

766
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,570
Yes.

767
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yes, that part.

768
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:21,760
Are there any other CCTVs
besides that one outside?

769
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,389
No, I think that's the only one
around here.

770
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,670
I'll look through the rest thoroughly
after I get a copy.

771
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,119
My gosh.

772
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,389
Are the cats making trouble?

773
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,599
Oh, gosh.

774
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:51,849
Well, this is...

775
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,750
- I'll take some rice cakes.
- All right.

776
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,480
There's not much storage space on here,

777
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,889
but there is some footage on here
that I had backed up.

778
00:51:58,019 --> 00:51:59,519
You can take this and use it too.

779
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,820
No, it's fine.

780
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,289
I think I'll have to get
a copy of everything.

781
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,659
I'll be right back.

782
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:08,429
I mean, the construction workers
kept parking here illegally,

783
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,929
so I got this CCTV to catch them.

784
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,500
But it's more popular than I thought.

785
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,309
- What?
- It was a long time ago,

786
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:20,610
but some guy came...

787
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,280
and asked to watch
the CCTV like you, detective.

788
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,579
He asked if he could get a copy.

789
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,320
So, I told him to go ahead.

790
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,780
When was this?

791
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,050
Was he a police officer?

792
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:32,150
No, he wasn't a police officer.

793
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,820
I'm not exactly sure when it was,

794
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,360
but I think it was about six months ago,
at least.

795
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,730
Didn't that man leave
some contact information or anything?

796
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,099
I'm not sure.

797
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:43,429
Oh, right.

798
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:45,869
After I made a copy for him,

799
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,670
he came back in a few days to thank me.

800
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,210
Here. He came and gave me this.

Is that man in this photo?

805
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,760
I'm not sure if I'd be able to remember
since it has been a while.

806
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:13,429
Hang on.

807
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,099
It was this guy.

808
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,099
Oh, right.

809
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:23,769
This was the man who got out of
the taxi in the CCTV footage too, right?

810
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:26,579
I knew I had seen him somewhere before.

811
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,280
It was this man.
The man who got a copy of the video.

812

Did you?

850

asked me out.

851
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,300
I told him we should remain friends,
but he didn't want to.

852
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:56,480
Even if I date Jun Seo,
it won't come between us, right?

853
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,909
We're all friends, so I'm worried...

854
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,980
that dating him might distance us.

855
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,750

Why are you asking me?

862
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:40,559
You can go out with him
if that's what you want.

863
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:45,960
Do you think so?

864
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:51,969
All right, then.

866
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,010

or at least an accomplice.

887

who was driving at the time?

Did Jae Gyeong see that CCTV footage?

891
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,650
You can't keep doing this.

892
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:28,590
How can I trust you?

893
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,059
You shouldn't get involved in this case
just because of the insurance money.

894
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,199
They'll see you as a target
if you keep going around with me.

895
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:35,329
You should worry about yourself.
