2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,450
(April 2005)

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,650
Hey, Kyung Tae.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,019
Chae Kyung Tae!

5
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:14,689
Where's the ramyeon?

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,190
In the kitchen.

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,359
Check inside the cabinets.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,129
In the cabinets?

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,739
I can't find it.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,509
Look harder.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,039
Come and take a look. It's not here.

12
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,909
Why can't you find it?

13
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,909
- It's right here.
- Where?

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,250
I see. It's here.

15
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,750
Is it that difficult to find?

16
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,850
Here it is.

17
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:50,789
Darn it.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,159
Come on.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,590
Why did you spill that?

20
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,259
It was because of you.

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,329
Make sure you clean that up well.

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,100
It stinks.

23
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,980
- Don't add in too much water.
- Don't worry.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,310
- No Gyu Min.
- Yes?

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,150
- Lend me your lighter.
- My lighter?

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,180
Let's see.

27
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,719
Here.

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,590
Okay.

29
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,659
I need to pee.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
It's on.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Darn it.

32
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,209
Is there no electricity?

33
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,840
There's no running water or gas.

34
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,310
Would there be electricity?

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,439
Darn it.

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,010
It's quiet today.

37
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,450
Is there no protest?

38
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,680
They went to talk to Won Jong Soo's dad.

39
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,920
If things go well,
they might get compensated.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,359
Hey, Chae Kyung Tae!

41
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,930
- What's this?
- What's what?

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,560
What are you staring at?

43
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,799
Darn you.

44
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,629
Won Jong Soo?

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,909
Are you insane?

46
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,479
Jong Soo, a fire.

47
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,719
Be quiet.

48
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,819
Oh Chi Hyun, stand him up.

49
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,919
You need to
remember your place, Kyung Tae.

50
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:39,729
(Connection)

51
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,069
(Episode 9)

52
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,050
(Tuesday, March 5)

53
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,900
Isn't it your day off?

54
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,129
It is.

55
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,240
I'll go to Cheongwoon Temple.

56
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,210
Go back to sleep.

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,860
(Gyeonggi 34A5253)

58
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,539
(Gyeonggi 34A5253)

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,150
Young Eun. Open the door.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,629
Jeong Young Eun!

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Who is it?

62
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,379
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,550
Is Yoon Ho home?

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,490
He's out.

65
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,550
Isn't it his day off?

66
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,060
It is.

67
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,920
He went to Cheongwoon Temple to pray.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,930
Cheongwoon Temple.

69
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,629
It's on Mount Injeok.

70
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,430
It's a bit off Route 392 to Hwansung City.

71
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,399
Captain Jang, we'll get Jeong Yoon Ho.

72
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,399
You stay there.

73
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,839
We'll get you backup from the patrol unit.

74
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,040
Talk to the family
and keep them distracted.

75
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,709
Be sure they don't talk to Jeong Yoon Ho.

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,110
Can I wait inside?

77
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,850
Okay.

78
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,889
Whose car is this?

79
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,629
It's mine.

80
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,860
What about it?

81
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,730
I'm just taking a look.

82
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,449
The compact vehicle in front
has tape over the license plates.

83
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:43,449
It's hard to track it down.

84
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,100
Is the car unlocked?

85
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,329
I think so?

86
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,550
What's this about?

87
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,290
Is someone taking an exam?

88
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:59,689
What?

89
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,689
You said he went to pray.

90
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,259
He goes to pray for this and that
on his days off.

91
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,470
Come in.

92
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:08,829
Goodness.

93
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
Your daughter?

94
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,810
Yes. She's in seventh grade.

95
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,850
Time flies, doesn't it?

96
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,019
Being a mom reminds me of
when I was in school.

97
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,759
Back then, we had so much fun together
whatever we did.

98
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,389
Right?

99
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,399
Can I sit down?

100
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Yes.

101
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:02,889
Yoon Ho.

102
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,490
Is he in trouble?

103
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,829
Was it a traffic accident?

104
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,230
Was he drunk?

105
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,269
I knew today was his day off.

106
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,740
I came by early to take him away...

107
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,810
as quietly as possible.

108
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
But here we are.

109
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,379
Did...

110
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,820
the other detectives go to get him?

111
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,230
You know...

112
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,100
he has a record, right?

113
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,429
I found out recently.

114
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:49,669
He didn't...

115
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,039
do the same thing, did he?

116
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,539
He can't have.

117
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,480
He promised me he wouldn't do it again.

118
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,250
His friends are his everything.

119
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,850
Even now, he went to pray
for Jong Soo's business to do well...

120
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,450
and for Tae Jin to become
the public prosecutor general.

121
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,059
Gosh.

122
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,190
He cares more about his friends
than his own family.

123
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,789
The case is still open.

124
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,799
So...

125
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,500
do something about it.

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,570
You're good at what you do.

127
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,309
You can help out a friend.

128
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
Jae Gyeong.

129
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,379
The case is still open.

130
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,190
So what?

131
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,330
Are you saying you'll arrest Yoon Ho?

132
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,029
You are.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,169
I'd forgotten that about you.

134
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,169
Years ago...

135
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,809
you coaxed kind Jun Seo...

136
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,210
into reporting your classmates
to the police.

137
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
What?

138
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,279
Are you getting revenge...

139
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,419
for getting kicked out of school?

140
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,450
- You loser.
- Si Jung.

141
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,360
You came to take Yoon Ho quietly?

142
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,230
Don't be stupid.

143
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,259
How dare you pretend
to be considerate when you came...

144
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,500
right at the time
our kid gets ready for school?

145
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,799
You're just a scumbag!

146
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,139
Si Jung.

147
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,740
Mom, I'm off to school.

148
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,889
Hey, sweetie.

149
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,190
Run away.

150
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,659
Get out of there.
Detectives are on the way.

151
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,169
Don't come home.

152
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,769
You can't get caught, okay?

153
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,539
Don't ever get caught!

154
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,299
Please take this child to school.

155
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,600
This officer will take you to school.

156
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,940
Let's go.

157
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,340
- Search the inside of the house.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,309
Call the forensics team
and tell them to analyze that car.

159
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,309
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
Unit Chief.

161
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,620
Yes, we're almost there.
We're 3km away.

162
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,990
Jeong Yoon Ho's wife told him
that you were on the way.

163
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:06,000
What? What are you saying?

164
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,100
What were you doing
that you couldn't even stop that?

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Sorry, ma'am.

166
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,269
All right.

167
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Darn it.

168
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,620
What did the chief say?

169
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,320
Did he just say to let it go?

170
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,820
I told you to look closely
at each of the taxis!

171
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,120
A taxi driver turned out to be
the culprit in the end!

172
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,029
This case got passed on
to Jang Jae Gyeong as a whole.

173
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,000
Park Jun Seo, Lee Myung Guk,

174
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,070
and the mill owner's case. All of it.

175
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,029
Seriously.

176
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,149
Yes, Prosecutor.
Do you have time for a call right now?

177
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,549
Didn't we get anything
from the CCTV cameras?

178
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,389
We got footage of Jeong Yoon Ho
leaving Cheongwoon Temple.

179
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,990
And after that?

180
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,360
He was caught on CCTV cameras again
on Route 887...

181
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,889
toward Hwansung.

182
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,389
We haven't located him after that.

183
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,100
From now on,
the mill murder case is ours too.

184
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,039
As you know, the suspect, Jeong Yoon Ho,
and his wife, Kang Si Jung,

185
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,200
are all Inspector Jang's
high school friends.

186
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,840
I think it'd be best
for Soo Hyun to lead this case.

187
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,279
You agree, right?

188
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,779
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,980
You can investigate Lemon Mulberry
and back Soo Hyun up.

190
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,250
First, look for places
where he might be hiding out.

191
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,850
Ask the local precincts
for CCTV footage from nearby.

192
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,649
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

(Park Jun Seo)

194
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,620
You're doing well.

195
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,690
Don't take more than
two pills this time either.

(CCTV Recording)

197
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,870
Hey, did you check it out?

198
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes, there was a package here,
just like you said.

199
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,940
How many pills are there?

200
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,440
Four. And there's a note.
Should I read it for you?

201
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
No.

202
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,850
Did you take those pills?

203
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Yes.

204
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,350
How is it? Does it help?

205
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,350
I'm not sure yet.

206
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,190
I just took it for the first time.

207
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,659
Are you at the police station now?

208
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,590
Yes, I'm on my way out now.

209
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,559
- Where to?
- Why?

210
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,830
What will you do if you go into shock
and pass out?

211
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,600
How touching.

212
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,970
Someone should stay by your side
until we confirm that those pills help.

213
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,940
So, where are you going?

214
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,919
CEO Won, today at 10 a.m.

215
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,450
And Vice-Chairman Han Sung Hoon
of Yigu Group is planning to visit...

216
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,789
Why is Han Sung Hoon coming here?

217
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,549
I believe it's about...

218
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,789
Yigu Group's regular board meeting
in two days.

219
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,460
What do you think?

220
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,830
Will Yigu invest in us?

221
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,029
It's hard to be certain
that the board will approve.

222
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,570
Those on the inside predict
it's about 50-50.

223
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,399
I can't believe
I'm so worried about the results...

224
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,009
of another company's board meeting.

225
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,210
And Park Tae Jin...

226
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,080
Tell him to come for dinner tonight.

(Pilo-dong Development Plan
Development Project Overview)

228
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,250
Vice President Han Sung Hoon
of Yigu Electronics is here.

229
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,289
Yes, send him in.

230
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,860
We just saw each other
a few days ago.

231
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,360
What did you want to say
that you called me here?

232
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,529
You could've just told me over the phone.

233
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,330
Did you just come from home?

234
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,899
Of course.
Where else would I have come from?

235
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,000
You know I take a day off every week.

236
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,169
By the way, what is it you want to say?

237
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,480
- Are you out of your mind right now?
- What?

238
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,539
The board meeting is in two days,
but you're lounging around at home?

239
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,710
Hey.

240
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,909
Does anything change
if I go and sit there?

241
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,720
If it's going to get passed,
it'll happen whether I'm there or not.

242
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,820
And if it isn't going to get passed,
it won't pass whether I'm there or not.

243
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,220
- It won't get passed anyway...
- Hey!

244
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,490
Darn it.

245
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,559
Hurry up, right this instant.

246
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,089
Get changed and go to the office.

247
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,029
Go and do everything you can
until the end.

248
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,500
Meet with the board members
who are for the bioindustrial complex...

249
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,769
and get their word for it.

250
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,640
If any punks are against it,
either buy them off or threaten them...

251
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,509
to get this passed by the board. Got it?

252
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,839
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

253
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,049
- I told you.
- Hey, Sung Hoon. You...

254
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,519
Both of us have to put our lives
on the line for this.

255
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,190
We have to show them this time.

256
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,619
We should show anyone with eyes...

257
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,920
that we're the next owners
of these companies.

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,460
- Isn't that right?
- That's... Right.

259
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,029
Yes, you're right.

260
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,359
Okay, I understand.

261
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,029
Calm down,
and let's grab some lunch first...

262
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,029
I have nothing more to say to you.
Just get going.

263
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,440
Go. Hurry up,

264
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,240
and have lunch
with your company's directors.

265
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,779
Gosh, punk. Why are you
acting like this all of a sudden?

266
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,130
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

267
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,059
Jeong Yoon Ho was watching you
from over there?

268
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,730
(We press our own oils.)

269
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,269
Yoon Ho didn't get
Jun Seo's call that day.

270
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,740
Judging by what he did at the funeral,

271
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,509
he might not even have come here, no?

272
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,809
That's what's weird.

273
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,579
Even at the funeral, Won Jong Soo,
Park Tae Jin, and Oh Chi Hyun...

274
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,880
didn't mention coming to
the construction site...

275
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,049
on the day Jun Seo died
until the very end.

276
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,180
Right.

277
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,049
But why did Jeong Yoon Ho,
who didn't even come here,

278
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,960
kill a man just to get rid of
that CCTV camera?

279
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,420
He wouldn't have even been on it.

280
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,930
Did the other guys make him do it?

281
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,529
Maybe they asked him to get rid of it
just in case.

282
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,869
Yoon Ho didn't come prepared
with a weapon.

283
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,680
He found out about that CCTV camera
and committed an unplanned murder.

284
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,509
(We press our own oils.)

285
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,960
What about Jeong Yoon Ho?
Did he get caught?

286
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,859
He must've run off for now,

287
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,329
but he will get caught soon
if we leave him be.

288
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,630
That idiot punk.

289
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,470
- Did you try calling him?
- His phone is turned off.

290
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,470
Let's wait. He has no one else
to ask for help but us.

291
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,970
I'm sure he'll call
once he gets somewhere safe.

292
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,910
He could've called Si Jung!

293
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,180
Si Jung is at the police station too.

294
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
What?

295
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,579
They must be questioning her
for helping Yoon Ho get away.

296
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,210
Is it Jang Jae Gyeong again?

297
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,690
What will you do now?

298
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,730
We'll have to help him hide.

299
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,759
We don't know what Jang Jae Gyeong has
as of now.

300
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,130
Hey.

301
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,630
I'm just coming from meeting with
Vice President Han of Yigu Electronics.

302
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,369
Their board meeting is in two days,

303
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,170
and we're really so close to the end.

304
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,210
But if we get tangled up
in Jeong Yoon Ho's case now,

305
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,869
it'll all be over, Tae Jin.

306
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,609
It's highly likely
that Yoon Ho will call you.

307
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,410
If he calls,

308
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,119
tell him not to get any other ideas
and to lie low.

309
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,220
Got it.

310
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,319
What I find odd is...

311
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,890
How did Jang Jae Gyeong
pinpoint Jeong Yoon Ho...

312
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,859
as the murderer of the mill owner?

313
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,730
Apparently, he suspected the taxi driver
from the beginning.

314
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,859
What if that punk, Jang Jae Gyeong,

315
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,430
had a copy of the CCTV footage
from the beginning?

316
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,970
Are you sure we weren't on there?

317
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,039
Jae Gyeong already knew.

318
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,109
What?

319
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,940
He came to see me yesterday morning.

320
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,450
He already knew
that we were all gathered...

321
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,450
at the construction site
the night Jun Seo died.

322
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
So?

323
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,089
What did you say to him?

324
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,690
I told him the truth.

325
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,220
We rode the elevator up,

326
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:56,359
and Jun Seo jumped from the ninth floor.

327
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,799
Why did you tell us that just now?

328
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,099
You had an important meeting ahead of you.

329
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,519
And did Jang Jae Gyeong believe that?

330
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,720
I don't know
what he's thinking on the inside.

331
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:26,720
He asked me if I killed Jun Seo...

332
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,289
and if you ordered me to do it.

333
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,859
What?

334
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,230
So what did you say?

335
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
I told him no,

336
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,769
not as far as I know.

337
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:41,940
"Not as far as I know?"

338
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:44,369
You two.

339
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:48,079
Why did you go to the construction site
so obediently?

340
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
What?

341
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,950
It was nearing midnight.

342
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,650
It wasn't like you to come out
just because he called you.

343
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:00,259
Jong Soo.

344
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,029
It wasn't you, was it?

345
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,359
Jerk. What are you talking about?

346
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,529
Why would I kill Jun Seo?

347
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,700
What about you?

348
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,099
Why did you show up that night?

349
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,380
I killed Lee Myung Guk.

350
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Why?

351
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,460
Why would you?

352
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,990
Did I ask you to kill him for me?

353
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,490
I didn't!

354
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,559
Lee Myung Guk...

355
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,970
constantly threatened you through me.

356
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,630
He demanded 100 dollars
for each pill made...

357
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,000
with the natural narcotics
he discovered, or...

358
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,740
He threatened to tell the world
about you...

359
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,210
and Yigu Group's Vice President Han...

360
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:53,910
that you two were addicted.

361
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,579
(Pilo Station)

362
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:56,579
Doctor!

363
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Get in.

364
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,549
Where are you suddenly taking me?

365
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,690
You know, to be honest,

366
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,660
the price you want is too much.

367
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Get in first.

368
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,089
We can't discuss it here.

369
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,859
I knew this would happen.

370
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,369
I thought you might get suspicious,
so I took a taxi.

371
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,269
It's not like I can abduct you
with a taxi.

372
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,809
Hurry and get in.

373
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,039
Come on, get in. Go on.

374
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,039
Initially, my plan was to just scare him.

375
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,079
Gosh.

376
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Punk.

377
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:43,329
You punk.

378
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,329
Hey.

379
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,529
Stop.

380
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,549
Push.

381
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:28,539
So?

382
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,670
You left Lee Myung Guk's body...

383
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,710
in Youngryun Cold Storage?

384
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,549
Yes.

385
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,779
(Youngryun Cold Storage)

386
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,549
Do you remember our visit
to Lee Myung Guk's place?

387
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,119
I told you that his body was frozen
at first,

388
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,690
but was recently buried,

389
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,630
and that someone had dug it back up...

390
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,759
to place it in his house.

391
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,359
Don't tell me he was here.

392
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,700
Did they leave him frozen
at this place for seven months?

393
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,799
The moment we discovered the body,

394
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:00,640
Molotov cocktails were thrown in.

395
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,039
And Yoon Ho was the one who threw them.

396
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,539
Yoon Ho?

397
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,039
Why? Why would he?

398
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,210
Whoever left Lee's body there...

399
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,680
must have told Yoon Ho...

400
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,519
that the man he killed and buried...

401
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,390
was dug back up and placed at home.

402
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,359
Did Yoon Ho kill Lee Myung Guk too?

403
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:26,359
Yoon Ho showed up at that house
to get rid of Lee Myung Guk's body.

404
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,299
So Jeong Yoon Ho killed
the owner of the mill...

405
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,900
and Lee Myung Guk.

406
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,670
But nothing connects them.

407
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,240
What if you had the body
of Lee Myung Guk stored...

408
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,769
at Youngryun Cold Storage
and was planning to retrieve it?

409
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,440
Which route would you take?

410
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,119
These two streets lead...

411
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,450
to a main street.

412
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,519
I would probably come from this way...

413
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,220
to avoid security cameras.

414
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,160
I'd pass the mill...

415
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,869
The security camera.

416
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,069
Yoon Ho killed the owner of the mill...

417
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,869
and attempted to get rid
of the security footage...

418
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,839
because he thought
he was caught on camera...

419
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,980
when he came to the storage...

420
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,049
to retrieve the body of Lee Myung Guk.

421
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Also,

422
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,119
when Yoon Ho's taxi passed
the street in front of the mill,

423
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:24,789
I doubt...

424
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,819
Yoon Ho was alone.

425
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,430
When did you take him out
of Youngryun Cold Storage?

426
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:31,289
Around 1:30 a.m. that day.

427
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,759
"That day?"

428
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:34,329
The day Jun Seo died.

429
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,430
Jun Seo called and told me...

430
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,339
if I didn't show up by 11:30 p.m.,

431
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,900
the police would go to the storage
the next morning...

432
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,069
to find Lee Myung Guk's body,

433
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,940
and that he'd confess we were behind it.

434
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,079
Does that mean Jun Seo had evidence?

435
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,319
He said he did.

436
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,619
Yoon Ho killed that mill owner...

437
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,519
because he was trying to get rid of...

438
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,390
the security footage we were on.

439
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,789
Don't make excuses for him.

440
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,160
Then what about Lee Myung Guk's body?

441
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,400
Who put it back in his home?

442
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,299
That's what I don't know.

443
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,630
Hey.

444
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,670
Don't tell me you don't know.

445
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:16,269
Who else aside from you and Yoon Ho knew
about moving the corpse?

446
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,039
No one.

447
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,180
Seriously, no one knows about it.

448
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,980
Don't say that and try to remember.

449
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,750
Ever since the body was found,
Jae Gyeong has been poking at everything.

450
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,950
You shouldn't have made such a mess
to begin with,

451
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,859
or at least cleaned it up well.

452
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,430
I'm frustrated too.

453
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,500
If it wasn't one of us, who was it?

454
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,799
It means someone...

455
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,000
was following you two that day.

456
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,799
How else would a buried corpse
return home?

457
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,579
There must be at least two people.

458
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
What?

459
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,920
Yoon Ho and I struggled to move him.

460
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,750
It's not a one-man job.

461
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,230
(Maintain safety together
for a safe Anhyun)

462
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,640
Looking at the color of your face,
it looks like the drug is working.

463
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,410
Should we meet around 7:00 p.m.?

464
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,210
Who do you think killed Park Jun Seo?

465
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,750
For now,

466
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,250
- I think it's Park Tae Jin.
- Why?

467
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,750
He performed
the postmortem screening himself.

468
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,690
He tried hard to stop the autopsy too.

469
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,990
He's also having an affair
with Choi Ji Yeon.

470
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,690
Do you think it was Tae Jin
who drugged me too?

471
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,769
Park Jun Seo made drug deliveries
for Won Jong Soo.

472
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,170
Despite that, he shared information
about a drug deal with me...

473
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,970
with the code 1882 before he was killed.

474
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,309
As soon as I received the information,
I was abducted...

475
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,109
and drugged.

476
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,039
Do you think...

477
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,220
Won Jong Soo made Lemon Mulberry
and sold it?

478
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,019
I see.

479
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,450
That's possible too.

480
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,960
You're from the Narcotics Unit,

481
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,529
and Jong Soo must have known...

482
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,700
that you recently got a special promotion.

483
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:22,029
If he could drug you
and get you out of the picture,

484
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,599
it would allow him to get rid of...

485
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,569
a big threat to his drug business.

486
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:29,569
But,

487
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,009
after they drugged me,

488
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,839
they could've left me anywhere.

489
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:37,279
But they dragged me to the scene
of a drug deal.

490
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,750
It was as if they were setting me up
to catch the culprit. Why?

491
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,619
What if...

492
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:45,759
someone is using you...

493
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,460
to get at Won Jong Soo?

494
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,059
It would keep their hands clean...

495
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,670
if they could take advantage of you
with the drug.

496
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,099
They can break up the organization
behind the Lemon Mulberry...

497
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,869
and can corner Won Jong Soo...

498
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,710
and drive him out.

499
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,779
No way.

500
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,289
Hey.

501
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,390
I've already started.

502
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,390
I'm sorry I'm late.

503
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,329
You work for the state.
It's hard to keep time.

504
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:58,329
Take a seat.

505
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Yes, sir.

506
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,630
I'm sorry, but I can't drink.

507
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,299
I have to go back to work after.

508
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,839
Okay.

509
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Here.

510
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:16,650
The old lady who used
to run this place died five years ago,

511
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,009
but the food tastes the same.

512
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,279
Gosh.

513
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,450
A person's taste can be the most cunning.

514
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,259
I wonder how people who take over
manage to keep the food tasting the same.

515
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,259
- Isn't it impressive?
- It is, yes.

516
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,400
Jong Soo.

517
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,269
Do you think
he'll do well if he succeeds me?

518
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,869
I can't even ask you a question.

519
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,279
- Eat up.
- I will.

520
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:51,549
I read your business proposal.

521
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:53,349
Thank you.

522
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:54,819
But why does...

523
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:58,420
the asset management company
have so many attachments?

524
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,460
Yigu Group will ask for an opening
to siphon money,

525
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,869
- and Keumhyung too...
- Is that...

526
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,740
what you want in return
for designing the business?

527
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,240
To make a secret opening
to siphon money from...

528
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,349
behind Jong Soo and my backs?

529
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,920
The reason I kept you close
since you were young is...

530
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,759
because I believed you knew
where the line was drawn.

531
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,859
You're crossing the line.

532
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I'm confident, Chairman Won.

533
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,569
This project will be a success.

534
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,599
Trust me once more.

535
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,380
Why are you doing this?

536
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,509
Twenty years ago,

537
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,750
when Anhyun City was established,

538
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,549
my father failed to grab the opportunity.

539
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,720
He sold his cattle one by one...

540
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,250
and lived off of the tiny amount
he got as compensation...

541
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,059
before dying as a nobody.

542
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,990
I don't want to be like my father.

543
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,930
I will make this opportunity count.

544
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,029
I'll use this project...

545
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,269
to go all the way and make Jong Soo
the richest man ever.

546
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,539
Let me take part in it.

547
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,970
You're just a deputy chief prosecutor.

548
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,380
I have many other contacts.

549
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,650
Prosecution office directors, ministers,
supreme court judges, assemblymen.

550
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,519
I can get them
to make the impossible possible...

551
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,420
and cover up mistakes.

552
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,319
Would I have let you...

553
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,920
stay close to Jong Soo for that long
only to use you to do that?

554
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,069
If you want to keep your promise
of making him the richest man ever,

555
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,339
you must remain a prosecutor
instead of joining this project...

556
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,509
and continue to do
what you have been doing.

557
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,980
Do your job.

558
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,240
Chairman.

559
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,680
Aren't we in the same boat now?

560
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,289
At last...

561
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,860
I see for sure what you were thinking.

562
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,429
You think you can't be replaced.

563
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,469
Don't you?

564
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,300
You were there beside me
and Jong Soo for 20 years,

565
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,840
and each time I made an important decision
I heard your advice.

566
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:35,610
Do you think...

567
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,110
that made you family?

568
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,150
Sir, I meant...

569
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,190
The moment you give up your duty,
you mean nothing to me.

570
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,719
Do not get on my nerves,

571
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,760
remain silent,

572
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,699
and remain in your position.

573
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,139
Hello.

574
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:04,809
I ordered an ice cream cake.
It's for Heo Joo Song.

575
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,809
Okay. How long do you need to travel?

576
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,139
About an hour?

577
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,179
Here you go.

578
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:12,550
- Are there candles too?
- Yes.

579
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,280
Thank you.

580
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,190
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

581
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:23,929
Hello.

582
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,400
Hey, you got here early.

583
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,909
I had something to set up.

584
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,110
- What's that?
- It's Yoon Jin's birthday.

585
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:49,110
We should surprise her.

586
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,389
It's frozen so hard
the candle won't go in.

587
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:00,659
Is it cold on your balcony?

588
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:03,030
Let's hide it there
and bring it out later.

589
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,860
I need you to cooperate.
You're in charge of the lighting.

590
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,199
It all depends on you.

591
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,599
- It's Yoon Jin.
- Why is she here so early?

592
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Hang on.

593
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,170
I'll hide out on the balcony.

594
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,710
The balcony. Wait.

595
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:22,110
Give me a while.
Don't open the door yet.

596
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,880
Just wait.

597
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,050
See you later. Okay?

598
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,090
Hey, hi.

599
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Hang on.

600
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,570
So what? Choi Ji Yeon...

601
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,139
No.

602
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,769
CW. Is she leaving?

603
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,539
Yes, in full makeup too.

604
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,639
What are they up to?

605
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,510
Follow her.

606
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,820
Yoon Jin. Can't we stop now?

607
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,519
All I do is follow people to motels.

608
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,619
I've been feeling a sense of shame...

609
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,690
because I didn't become
a reporter to do this.

610
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,860
Hang on a bit. We're almost there.

611
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,260
We need to figure out
the password Park Tae Jin wants.

612
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,230
What if she goes right into the motel?

613
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,400
Then you can go home.

614
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,239
Hey.

615
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,909
We'll make some progress today.

616
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:25,440
That's how things look right now.

617
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,849
If Park Tae Jin keeps feeling rushed,

618
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,349
there's a possibility
that she might reveal everything today.

619
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,650
It's not like CW
will tell the passcode for all to hear.

620
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,619
You don't know what Park Tae Jin's like.

621
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,789
He's going to make Choi Ji Yeon
tell him the password no matter what.

622
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:44,460
Even if we don't get the password,

623
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,559
Tae Jin might say what the account is...

624
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,800
and how much is in it.

625
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,139
Stop complaining
and get a recording, okay?

626
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,269
Okay.

627
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,710
Text me when they meet up.

628
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,489
What's this weird atmosphere?

629
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,289
Your call ended?

630
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,519
Yes.

631
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,190
Where were you?

632
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,630
I just got here.

633
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:19,960
As if.

634
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,829
I saw your shoes and jacket as I came in.

635
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,699
I was on the toilet.
Gosh, my stomach.

636
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,510
The toilet? Okay.

637
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:32,340
Did you read Lee Myung Guk's work logs?

638
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

639
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,530
Hey, we looked and found nothing.

640
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,929
It's just a list of times
and places or names.

641
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,670
Yes. Did you find a phone or something?

642
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,840
- Yoon Jin.
- Yes?

643
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,170
What character do you think this is?

644
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,909
What CEO doesn't know this?

645
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,710
It's "pil." It means "at all costs"
or "without fail."

646
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,110
It's "pil," right?

647
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,550
I thought so,
but the handwriting was dreadful.

648
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:18,250
Hang on.

649
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,460
Look at this.

650
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,389
It's here too.

651
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,559
Oh, it's the same.

652
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,429
(March 18, 2023, Research lab,
"necessary," "discussion")

653
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:36,769
It's here too.

654
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,010
It's at 9 p.m.

655
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,309
Did he work overtime?

656
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,780
Then, at 7 a.m...

657
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,150
or at 9 p.m. "Research lab."

658
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,380
"Necessary. Discussion."

659
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,250
Does this mean there was something
he needed to discuss?

660
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,619
Jeong Sang Eui.

661
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
What?

662
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,929
I think this is referring
to Jeong Sang Eui.

663
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,829
Jeong Sang Eui was...

664
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:04,570
Lee Myung Guk's direct junior researcher
at Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

665
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,570
What?

666
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,170
Why are you only telling us that now?

667
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm telling you now.

668
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,409
Didn't you know? I knew that already.

669
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,280
Hey, how would I know about
what's going on with Jeong Sang Eui?

670
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,980
Gosh, hang on. So, what's going on?

671
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,380
Then, whether it was at 7 a.m. or 9 p.m.,

672
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:23,050
he met with Sang Eui in person
at the research lab no matter what.

673
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,190
Is there a meeting that's not necessary
to meet in person?

674
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,829
Hey, could this be...

675
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,530
Hang on.

676
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,699
(Pilo-dong in Chinese characters)

677
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,800
I was right.

678
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,269
The character for "pil"
that means necessary...

679
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,530
is used in the name, "Pilo-dong."

680
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,039
- Pilo-dong?
- Research lab. Pilo-dong.

681
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,969
Jeong Sang Eui. What's this?

682
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:45,739
Youngryun Cold Storage.

683
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,409
I checked on the way.

684
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,010
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical owns
Youngryun Cold Storage.

685
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,510
(Certified copy of real estate register)

686
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,980
But there was no office there.

687
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,750
There was nothing there when we went.

688
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,150
The search and seizure warrant
will be issued soon.

689
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,489
We should go and look through the place.

690
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,590
Okay. I'm coming too.

691
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,329
(9 p.m., Research lab,
Pilo-dong, Sang Eui)

692
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Is this it?

693
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,510
Yes.

694
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,210
They left right after that.

695
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,920
Yes, I understand.

696
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,650
Then, I'll be going home now.

697
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,920
Yes, thank you.

698
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:45,170
Why are they only talking
in the car today?

699
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,199
Go to a motel or something.

700
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,869
I'm starving.

701
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,619
What's that?

702
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,170
Let me take this call.

703
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,809
The cake will melt.

704
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,909
Gosh, you're right.

705
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,579
Yes, what happened?

706
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:35,380
They didn't go anywhere today...

707
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,719
and were only talking in the car.

708
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,420
But CW just left and is on the move.

709
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Alone?

710
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Yes.

711
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,230
Did they perhaps fight?

712
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,429
I wouldn't know.
They only stayed in the car.

713
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:50,429
But the direction she's headed
is the complete opposite of her house.

714
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,429
Which direction is it?

715
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,269
Oh, hang on.

716
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,110
What is it?

717
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,769
She just went into an apartment complex.

718
00:43:57,769 --> 00:43:58,769
Which apartment?

719
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:00,139
Park Tae Jin's apartment?

720
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,539
I'm not sure. I can't see very well.

721
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,579
That can't be.

722
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,750
Park Tae Jin is married
and even has a kid.

723
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,519
Is his house empty today?

724
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,019
Gosh.

725
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,760
Those two are getting so bold.

726
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,210
She's at the entrance
of the apartment now.

727
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,510
What about Park Tae Jin?
Is he not there yet?

728
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,679
No. I'm not sure,
but I don't think he's here yet.

729
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,519
- Go in after her.
- But I'll be caught.

730
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,380
Still, you could check
the building and unit number.

731
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,119
Hang on.

732
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,320
Well, it's not the first floor.

733
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,289
How many floors is the whole building?

734
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Three floors.

735
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,159
Hang on.

736
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,530
She's headed to the second floor.

737
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:56,199
What?

738
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,599
What's the apartment called?

739
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,739
Taekyung Apartment.

740
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,440
Taekyung Apartment,
Building 306, 2nd floor.

741
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:23,989
Hello.

742
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:25,329
Yes, hello.

743
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,460
Come in.

744
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,780
(What's going on?)

745
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,780
What's going on?

746
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,280
Hold.

747
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,070
(293D3929)

748
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,639
(293D3929)

749
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,309
(293D3929)

750
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,349
(293D3929)

751
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,159
(Building 306, Unit 202,
Taekyung Apartment)

752
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,130
(Taekyung, 306)

753
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,250
How did you know to come here?

754
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,690
I was wondering how to deliver this,

755
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,929
but then, I heard you had a meeting today.

756
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:14,670
I'm not sure if it'll help.

757
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,739
Oh, you must've gotten the results
for the Safe Inheritance One-stop Service.

758
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,079
Gosh, you could've told me this
over the phone.

759
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,780
Jun Seo's bank account information,

760
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,619
his insurance policies...

761
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,820
His bank account information?

762
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,590
Most of them, I already knew about.

763
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,690
But one of them is weird.

764
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,150
Which one?

765
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,389
Out of the insurance policies below,

766
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,530
there was a pension insurance
that Jun Seo got 11 years ago.

767
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,900
He had it since before our marriage,

768
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,699
but I had no idea about it.

769
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:44,570
So, I asked the insurance company...

770
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,570
and an old lady in her 60s in Boryeong
has been receiving the pension.

771
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:49,739
Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province?

772
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,079
Yes, neither Jun Seo nor I have
any connections to that place.

773
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,440
So, did you go there?

774
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,039
Not yet.

775
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,050
What about the address?

776
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:58,809
Have you found that out?

777
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,619
- Yes.
- Then, please tell us the address.

778
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,719
Well,

779
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,530
didn't you say you came
in case you could help?

780
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,730
Let's go together.

781
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:16,929
All of us.

782
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,730
Us?

783
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:25,769
Jun Seo's case...

784
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,880
is still being investigated by the police.

785
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,579
We haven't gotten the autopsy results
from the NFS yet either.

786
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,480
Anything that might serve as proof
in revealing Jun Seo's cause of death...

787
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:36,150
should be left to the police...

788
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,119
to investigate, even if you're curious.

789
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:40,619
If that's why you came,
you made the right decision.

790
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,860
I told you this before, Joo Song,

791
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:48,630
but the life insurance money
that my husband left behind...

792
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,630
He left it to the two of you...

793
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,599
because he needed to use it as bait
for you to reveal the truth...

794
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,869
about his wrongful death.

795
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,639
"Bait?"

796
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:01,179
Did you just say it was bait?

797
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,079
Where are you going?

798
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,179
You heard her.

799
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:09,150
She told me this before.

800
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,849
Then, I already know this part.

801
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,750
You two can talk amongst yourselves.

802
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,860
So?

803
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,929
If the insurance payout was
five million dollars,

804
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:24,230
The insurance payment
must have been expensive.

805
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,800
Where do you think that money came from?

806
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,300
He probably paid it with our money.

807
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,840
- So?
- So...

808
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,110
That five million dollars...

809
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,250
As a matter of fact, it belongs to me.

810
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,420
Hold on.

811
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,920
What kind of nonsense is this?

812
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,949
Yoon Jin.

813
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:46,960
Hey.

814
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,219
The insurance money belongs
to the recipient.

815
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,690
Who cares who paid for it?

816
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,429
Also, if it's yours, it's yours.

817
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,460
What do you mean it's a matter of fact?

818
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,570
I'm speechless.

819
00:49:57,769 --> 00:49:59,469
He didn't give it
to his closest friends...

820
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,199
or his sole family member.

821
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,940
He left the two of you his insurance money
although he hardly contacted you.

822
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:08,139
You found that strange too.

823
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,449
Isn't this a matter
of being shameless or not?

824
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,880
- "Shameless?"
- Yoon Jin.

825
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,099
Ji Yeon.

826
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,230
Let me talk casually
since I'm a few years older.

827
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,699
I can let everything pass,

828
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:39,139
but it makes me sick
to hear you say the word "shameless."

829
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,110
What did you say?

830
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,809
How dare you call me shameless?

831
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,019
If you want to keep your promise
of making him the richest man ever,

832
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:23,219
you must remain a prosecutor
instead of joining this project...

833
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,250
and do your job.

834
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,230
The moment you give up your duty,
you mean nothing to me.

835
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:37,030
Do not get on my nerves,

836
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,099
remain silent,

837
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,800
and remain in your position.

838
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,409
I'm afraid...

839
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:47,539
one day I won't even see you...

840
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,150
as a friend of my child.

841
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,619
You're so busy.
Are you sure we can go to Jeju Island?

842
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,590
I already booked the hotel and the flight.

843
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,659
Don't worry, I can make it.

844
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,659
Doesn't your family say anything?

845
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,929
You're always away on weekends.

846
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:14,699
What?

847
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,070
No.

848
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,480
(Park Jun Seo)

849
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,429
- Yes, Jun Seo. Why...
- Are you with Ji Yeon?

850
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,269
At 11:30 p.m.,

851
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:48,269
show up at the construction site
by the Pilo-dong three-way intersection.

852
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,610
Come around the back alley
where you'll find an open entrance.

853
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,380
A construction site?

854
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,309
Why at this hour?

855
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,079
Tae Jin, I can't go on any longer.

856
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:05,119
I intend to tell the guys...

857
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,760
- what we've been up to.
- Jun Seo.

858
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,489
You said we'd stop
if we reached 500,000 dollars.

859
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,360
But you didn't listen to my request,

860
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,300
and I had no choice...

861
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:18,530
but to let my daughter go.

862
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:20,500
On top of that, now...

863
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Jun Seo.

864
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,239
Not today. Let's talk one-on-one.

865
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:28,309
- You're too emotional right now.
- You're wrong.

866
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,380
My mind's clearer than ever.

867
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:35,679
I can see everything clearly.

868
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:39,389
I'm scared too,

869
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,590
but...

870
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,159
if I can turn anything back,

871
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,429
I must do it.

872
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,829
- Jun Seo.
- When you get there,

873
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,000
you'll learn something new...

874
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,239
about the other guys too.

875
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,239
See you in a bit.

876
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,039
Park Jun Seo.

877
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,809
Yes?

878
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:46,219
Hello?

879
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,659
Tae Jin. It's me, Yoon Ho.

880
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,489
What? Where are you?

881
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,230
I'm still in Anhyun.

882
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,159
Why did you call me?

883
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:58,230
- I'm hanging up.
- I'm calling from a payphone.

884
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,199
Tae Jin,

885
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,940
please help me.

886
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,440
You can't call me like this.
How can I help you?

887
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,940
I don't have anything else to say.
Don't call me again.

888
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,280
Jun Seo's wife.

889
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:12,380
Did Jun Seo know about it?

890
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,019
That you have...

891
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,320
a thing with her?

892
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,320
- What did you say?
- I noticed you met her today too.

893
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:21,820
I wonder what Jong Soo will say
when he finds out.

894
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,159
He might think you killed Jun Seo...

895
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,559
because of it.

896
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,960
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yes.

897
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,530
I'm crazy. So what?

898
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,769
You have to help me!

899
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,269
I know you can.

900
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,070
I can leave the logs here, right?

901
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,480
I'll get going.

902
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:18,079
Yoon Jin!

903
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:23,719
Happy birthday

904
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,989
To you

905
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,920
Happy birthday to you

906
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:34,599
- Happy birthday, dear Yoon Jin
- Happy birthday, dear Yoon Jin

907
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,900
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

908
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,809
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

909
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,610
I didn't know things would turn this way.

910
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:52,409
But still, it's your birthday.
I can't just skip over it.

911
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,480
Hey, this is dripping.

912
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,489
Just blow them out,

913
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:59,690
make a wish, and eat the cake.

914
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,820
Please don't be so angry.

915
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,130
Happy?

916
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,909
Is today...

917
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,079
your birthday?

918
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,510
Yes.

919
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:48,099
Ji Yeon! What's the matter?

920
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,099
Are you all right?

921
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,539
Are you okay?

922
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,510
Ji Yeon!

923
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,050
Ji Yeon?

924
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,079
Was it what she ate?

925
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,800
Please choose your four-digit passcode.

926
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
(8 years ago)

927
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,940
What should we use?

928
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:29,510
(Never share your passcode.)

929
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,179
What is that?

930
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,579
It's just the one I've been using
for a long time.

931
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:34,650
- Really?
- Yes.

932
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,019
Should we use that from now on?

933
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:38,949
- Sure.
- Okay.

934
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,039
(March 5, Tuesday)

935
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,389
Are you all right?

936
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,940
Gosh.

937
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,880
I'm leaving too.

938
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,079
Already?

939
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:38,710
I blew out the candles, didn't I?

940
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,820
The cake melted too.

941
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,150
This man has been tailing Park Tae Jin
and Choi Ji Yeon for the last while.

942
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:46,349
I'm sending pictures to you
because I find him suspicious.

943
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:49,619
(This man has been tailing Park Tae Jin
and Choi Ji Yeon for the last while.)

944
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,690
(I'm sending pictures to you
because I find him suspicious.)

945
00:59:53,059 --> 00:59:54,130
That's Jeong Yoon Ho.

946
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,030
Jae Gyeong.

947
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,570
This is in front of my house.

948
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:04,139
Jae Gyeong!

949
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,380
What's going on?

950
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,210
Jeong Yoon Ho!

951
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:46,909
(Connection)

952
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,460
(You're doing well.)

953
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,530
(Don't take more than two pills
this time either.)

954
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,019
(Connection)

955
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,889
Once this weekend is over,
that money means nothing to me.

956
01:01:27,889 --> 01:01:30,989
- Oh Yoon Jin.
- Whoever opens that box is the owner.

957
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:33,389
If anyone murdered Jun Seo...

958
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,000
and staged it as a suicide,

959
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,500
you're the only one I can think of.

960
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,130
No, Gong Jin Wook!

961
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,300
He's the one behind everything.

962
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,869
Detective, come and arrest them quietly.

963
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:42,869
Kim Chang Soo!

964
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,110
What are you doing here?

965
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,539
What's wrong with detectives these days?

966
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:47,940
One's a druggie, and...

967
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,940
Shut your mouth!

968
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:49,940
Both of them died.

969
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,949
Now, you're the only one left
who took the drug.

970
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,010
It looks like the answer is out.

971
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,349
Did you order them to kill both?

972
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:55,719
- Hey!
- Am I wrong?

973
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,019
I killed Lee Myung Guk,

974
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,519
and I killed Park Jun Seo too.

975
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:05,329
