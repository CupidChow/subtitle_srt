Why didn't you tell anyone?

79
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,460
You could've reported me.

80
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,860
I thought you had a good enough reason.

81
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,969

82
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,539

83

until you told me first.

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,820
There's no one here by that name.

186
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,049
- What's going on?
- It's correct.

187
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,960
Wait. Please excuse me.

188

189
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,230

- Hey.

192
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,169
There's a private elevator, right?

193
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,970
Yes. Please get it ready.

194
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,309
We're heading in.

195
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:04,919
You...

196
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,759
What are you doing here?

197
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,100
Shall we go?

198
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,330
What is this? What do you want?

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,240
Hey. Let go of me.

200
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,309
Excuse me. Please call the police.

201
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,309
What do you think you're doing?

202
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,549
Where are you taking me?

203
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Darn it.

(Woonjong Medical Center)

205
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:31,649
Hey.

206
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,250
This is kidnapping.

207
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Hey!

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,789

Hey! Oh Chi Hyun!

214
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,210
Help!

215
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,509

- Mi Jung.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,779
Go out and get some fresh air.

219
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,250
Yes, sir.

220
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,090
How have you been?

221
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,460
It's so nice to meet you again.

222
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,789
You don't have an accent anymore.

223
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,360

(Jang Jae Gyeong,
Could I call you back later?)

227
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,279
Why did you change your name?

228
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,879
Before my mother passed away,

229
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,350
she changed it
and told me to stop going to prison.

230
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,379
It was her dying wish.

231
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,120
Did the shaman say
you'd stop going to prison...

232
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,590
- if you changed your name to Dae Chill?
- Yes.

233
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,049
What? How did you know...

234
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,159
How did you open this place
as soon as you got out?

235
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I started it
with my mother's insurance money.

236
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,399
Are you the car owner?

237
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,070
Where is this right now?

238
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,299
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

239
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,769
There were drugs in your car.

240
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,200
That really wasn't me.

241
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,840
You know I never touch drugs.

242
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,809
I know. I thought it was strange.

243
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,250
But it's still true
that there were drugs in your car.

244
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,509
Park Jin Hwan, that punk!

245
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,779
Park Jin Hwan? Who is that?

246
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,149
He's a friend from my hometown.

247
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,720
He said that if I got him a rental car
under my name...

248
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,289
he'd rent it out
and make 3,000 dollars a month for me.

249
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,820
That's illegal.
Did you really fall for that?

250
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,659
Someone out there
had the guts to con Straw?

251
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,590
Sir. I mean, sirs.

252
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,159
I swear it wasn't me.

253
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,269
My couriers are clean, and her...

254
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,440
My secretary...
She's a secretarial studies major...

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,110
whom I hired publicly.

256
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,639
Okay, I get that,
but that's the current situation.

257
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,779
I need you to ask around and figure out...

258
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,210
- who actually drove your car.
- What?

259
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,980
You need to prove your innocence.

260
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,590
I changed my name to avoid this.

261
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,059
Then...

262
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,259
can I go hard like I used to?

263
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
You'd have to, right?

264
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,669
But don't hurt anyone.

265
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,500
Well, okay.

266
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,899
I'll be in touch.

267
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,179
What floor is Chief Secretary
Oh Chi Hyun's office on?

268
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,980
Who are you?

269
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,049
I'm his high-school friend,
and I have business with him.

270
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,990
Just a moment.

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,799
Wait.

273
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,269
- Hang on.
- What are you doing?

274
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,269
- Stop him.
- What's this?

275
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,569
- Yoon Jin!
- You can't go in.

276
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,410
Stop him. Grab hold.

277
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,609
Yoon Jin.

278
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,789
Sorry.

279
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,119
Yoon Jin. Are you okay?

00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,920
Why would that Chi Hyun punk abduct you?

284
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,650
- Joo Song.
- What?

285
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,390
Shall we eat some beef?

286
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,410
Will this be okay?

287
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,509
So what if it's not?

288
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,480
I can't take any more pills.

289
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,880
I must hold out as best I can.

290
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,990
See you tomorrow.

291
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,539
- Hey.
- It's me.

292
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,069
Yoon Jin was abducted today.

293
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,069
What?

Yoon Jin...

295
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,410
was kidnapped by Oh Chi Hyun.

296
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,410
Where are you right now?

297
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,450
Why did you go off during a barbecue
to talk for so long?

298
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,220
I talked to Jae Gyeong.

299
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,490
He's coming.

300
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,529
Did you tattle to him again?

301
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,900
Darn it.

302
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,759
Will you tell me now?

303
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,670
Why did Chi Hyun take you there,

304
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,670
and why am I here grilling sirloin?

305
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,009
I need to know if I'm to taste anything.

306
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,819
How did you know that's where I was?

307
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,289
- Hyun Woo told me.
- Hyun Woo?

308
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,059
The teenager living at
the Audiophile address.

309
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,890
How did he know where I was?

310
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,559
I don't know that.

311
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,099
But he called and said
some guys had abducted you...

312
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,970
and had taken you
to Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

313
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,269
Was it Chi Hyun who kidnapped you?

314
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,799
What happened in there...

315
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,769
that made you conclude you wanted beef?

316
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,910
Are you insane?

317
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,619
What do you want?

318
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:13,819
What?

319
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,990
You lot can go, but bring two coffees.

320
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,089
I don't want a coffee, punk.

321
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,359
So,

322
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,170
I read what you'd been writing.

323
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:29,369
What?

324
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:30,769
You suddenly care?

325
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,039
The medication we supplied
to Woonjong Medical Center.

326
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,369
How did you know
there was a problem with it?

327
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,809
You think that's important right now?

328
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,910
You just abducted a journalist.

329
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,880
Do you think I'll let you off?

330
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,119
Will you let Jun Seo go?

331
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,990
He was in real estate.

332
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,519
What's this business card?

333
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,690
How will you explain it?

334
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,069
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

335
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,200
It's Jong Soo's job interview.

336
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,470
What?

337
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,769
If he's to become
Keumhyung Group's next chairman,

338
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,240
he has to turn
the failing Keumhyung Pharmaceutical...

339
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,309
into a profitable company.

340
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,309
If he can't do that,

341
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,849
even as the only son,
his future isn't guaranteed.

342
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,819
What does that have to do with Jun Seo?

343
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
We were friends.

344
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,920
Jun Seo, Tae Jin, Yoon Ho, and I.

345
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,690
We all pitched in.

346
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,460
To make Jong Soo
the chairman of a large company,

347
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,000
we contacted cousins, in-laws,
and their cousins and friends.

348
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,099
We went to every person
we could think of...

349
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,569
to sell Keumhyung's medication.

350
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,109
That's why...

351
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,279
we all had business cards.

352
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,509
And Woonjong Medical Center?

353
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,980
There must've been
a designated salesperson.

354
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,920
We hadn't been able to supply
Woonjong Medical Center.

355
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:58,289
Jun Seo got us in...

356
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,019
because he'd met the director
at a gathering.

357
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,789
That was why...

358
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:06,000
Jun Seo went to so many events.

359
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,529
My investigation will reveal...

360
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,170
if you're telling the truth or not.

361
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:13,369
I don't think...

362
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,710
I can let this drop.

363
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,980
Now that you've abducted me,

364
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,309
are you going to make me vanish next?

365
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,559
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
Chief Secretary Oh Chi Hyun)

366
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
What are these?

367
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,410
I prepared these because...

368
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,009
I had a feeling we'd meet like this.

369
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,079
I just saw how determined you were,

370
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,579
so one won't be enough.

371
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,210
I'll use both.

372
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Gosh.

373
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,549
You're breaking lots of laws today.

374
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,390
Why?

375
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,119
Are you trying to buy me off?

376
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,059
Buying you off won't be enough, will it?

377
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,509
You got something very wrong about me.

378
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,759
The photos told me
I needed both a bribe and blackmail.

379
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,819
Hey.

380
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,160
How come
you're always photographed eating?

381
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,099
Which place was the best?

382
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,299
Joo Song.

383
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
What?

384
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,109
Today...

385
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,339
I miss my daughter even more.

386
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,049
Will you stop it?

387
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,150
You've had enough to drink.

388
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,049
Hey, Jae Gyeong.

389
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
You'll sit there?

390
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,809
How long was I out for?

391
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,619
During our school's summer break.

392
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,119
Where was that?

393
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,160
Jun Seo's mom's home.

394
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,630
- Busan.
- Yes, Busan.

395
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,660
Busan. And then...

396
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,329
What did we say we talked about?

397
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,069
Why she broke up with Jun Seo.

398
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,269
Yes. You fell asleep after that.

399
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:35,869
Did he...

400
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,509
eat beef too?

401
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,650
He refused to eat meat
bought with suspicious money.

402
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,680
He didn't even touch his chopsticks.

403
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,990
Darn it.

404
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,990
You cold-blooded freak.

405
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
You cold-blooded freak.

406
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,299
Gosh.

407
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,670
Jae Gyeong, stop the car! Hurry!

408
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,039
Hey, Yoon Jin. Hang in there.

409
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,000
- Hey.
- I...

410
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,710
Are you okay?

411
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,410
Keep going.

412
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,349
Tissues.

413
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,589
I need some tissues too.

414
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,390
Hey, are you okay?

415
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,599
Jun Seo came to see me too.

416
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,140
He was standing outside my house.

417
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,839
Yoon Jin.

418
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,200
Are you feeling better?

419
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:09,769
About Yoon Hee.

420
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,079
I'm sure she went somewhere nice.

421
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,150
Right.

422
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:34,119
He stayed for about ten minutes in total.

423
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,089
Or maybe it was even less.

424
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,670
He just sat there without saying much
and then left.

425
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,170
I didn't even know
that would be the last time.

426
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,269
After I heard that Jun Seo had died,

427
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,380
I wondered,
"What did he come to tell me that day?"

428
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,519
'What was it..."

429
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,750
"that he found it so hard to spit it out?"

430
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,089
It made me think all sorts of things.

431
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:14,400
I wonder if that punk died
while knowing or not.

432
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,170
Hey.

433
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,069
Jun Seo's wife, Choi Ji Yeon...

434
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,240
She's hanging out with Park Tae Jin now.

435
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,279
She's making rounds with him every night
at all the motels throughout Anhyun.

436
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,309
How did you know?

437
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,150
I just happened to find out.

438
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,250
Isn't it the duty of a human being
to abstain for at least 49 days...

439
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,750
after your husband dies?

440
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,990
Who else knows about this?

441
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,619
I don't know.

442
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,390
I don't think the others know either.

443
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,529
Didn't Park Tae Jin kill Park Jun Seo?

444
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,670
That guy was acting weird
at the funeral too.

445
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,740
Hey, you should arrest him
and do some investigating.

446
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,369
You'll find something, at least.

447
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:00,240
What would I do after arresting
an acting prosecutor with no proof...

448
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,480
just because he had an affair?

449
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,119
Hey, what are you talking about right now?

450
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,519
Tae Jin killed Jun Seo?

451
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,589
It's late. Let's go.

452
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,329
No, I... Hey, I'm on the team too.

453
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,329
Why don't I know so much?

454
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,869
Tell me.

455
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,509
Pardon?

456
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,750
The most important thing
is to keep people's mouths shut.

457
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,819
Yes, take care of it and let me know.

458
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,289
Yesterday afternoon, at Keumhyung
Pharmaceutical research center,

459
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,059
Vice-Chairman Won went into shock
during his speech.

460
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,789
I've told the research center to take care
of things so that word doesn't get out.

461
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,160
Where is he now?

462
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,160
He's resting at home.

463
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,319
Darn it.

464
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:27,299
Dad.

465
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,200
I was...

466
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,210
not happy that you were my child.

467
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,880
No matter how classless
your mother's blood may be,

468
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,450
you have at least half of my blood.

469
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,380
So, I expected you to have
at least one part of you...

470
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,920
that resembled me.

471
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,930
It's a flight for this afternoon.

472
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,430
(Won Jong Soo,
From Seoul-Incheon to LA)

473
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,099
Go...

474
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,710
and don't come back.

475
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,269
But...

476
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,109
Dad.

477
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,509
Dad.

478
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,640
I'm sorry, I...

479
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,650
I'll do better.

480
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,420
From now on,
I'll really stop doing drugs...

481
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,119
and do better, Dad. Please?

482
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,690
In order for Tae Jin to wrap this up well,

483
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,460
I should help him out.

484
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,420
I may not be a leader,

485
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:32,660
but you know
how I'm a great supporter, Dad.

486
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,700
So, please don't tell me
to go to the US, okay?

487
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,329
Please, Dad.

488
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,940
Meet with Mayor Joo In Sang...

489
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,710
and wrap up the licensing issue
as soon as possible.

490
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,240
That's where your role ends.

491
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:17,869
Hey.

492
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,410
Have you graduated from being
Won Jong Soo's driver?

493
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,279
I was worried
you might bring Jong Soo along.

494
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:26,980
What brought you here?

495
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,390
Was what you got yesterday not enough?

496
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,319
That's right. It was.

497
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:34,789
Hey.

498
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,730
Hurry up and take it. My arm hurts.

499
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,430
You'll find that it's a bit short.

500
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,869
I got myself a comfortable pair
of sneakers.

501
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,869
Since you broke my laptop,
I ordered one with the latest specs.

502
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:51,269
And I felt like this money was
encouragement from a friend...

503
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,440
so that I could be a good reporter,

504
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,779
so I had some beef and soju.

505
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,880
And those pictures...

506
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,619
Send them wherever you want to.

507
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,890
I'm known in this field
for easily accepting what's offered to me.

508
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,589
Everyone will be tired of it.

509
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,160
Hey.

510
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,700
It would be worth a news article
if a giraffe ate some meat.

511
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,369
Who cares if a wolf has some meat?

512
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,710
I'm off. Gosh, that darn gorilla.

513
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,150
- You're here.
- Yes.

514
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,950
That punk is being so flippant.

515
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,490
You didn't get any valuable information
all night, did you?

516
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
No, ma'am.

517
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,329
Gosh, seriously.

518
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,000
Do you want one too?

519
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:53,799
Thank you, ma'am.

520
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,349
Did you get anything else?

521
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,950
No, he keeps acting dumb.

522
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,389
Captain.

523
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,590
We got the vehicle registration info
for the black SUV.

524
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,630
I sent it to you.

525
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,030
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

526
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,409
(83P3234, black SUV, address of owner,
Join-dong Hongan-ro Fine Class Apartment)

527
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:31,670
(Building 702, Unit 1904, Yoo Sung Eun)

528
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,050
(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,420
Who is it?

532
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,690
(Calling)

533
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,159
I'm a security guard at this apartment.

534
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,989
What do you need to explain that...

535
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,289
- Excuse me.
- Who are you?

536
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,559
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

537
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,829
On February 23, around 11:20 p.m.,

538
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:31,670
did you drive to Pilo-dong?

539
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,539
- Pardon?
- Last Friday night.

540
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,610
You dropped someone off
at a construction site...

541
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,039
near Pilo-dong
three-way intersection, right?

542
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:42,679
- No.
- Think about it carefully.

543
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,480
Last Friday night?

544
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,150
You mean the alley with the mill...

545
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,920
inside Pilo-dong three-way intersection?

546
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,960
- Yes.
- Yes, I was there.

547
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,590
Why did you go there?

548
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,000
That's my mom's place.

549
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,099
If you keep going past the mill,
there's an alley that comes to a dead-end.

550
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,769
The tile-roof house at the end
is my parents' house.

551
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,099
You went there
when it was almost midnight?

552
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,809
Can't I do that?

553
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,269
Why did you go there?

554
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:14,980
I went there
after fighting with my husband.

555
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,309
But then,
why did you stop there for a while?

556
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,349
- Where?
- In front of the mill.

557
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,079
You stepped on the brake
and stood there for about five seconds.

558
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,619
Didn't you let someone off there?

559
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,559
Oh, back then...

560
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:28,590
Someone suddenly jumped out
from an alleyway.

561
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,760
I was about to turn right
and someone suddenly jumped out.

562
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,400
I stopped because I was so surprised.

563
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,139
I'll return this to you after we check it.

564
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:44,210
- When?
- Within a few days.

565
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,440
Okay.

566
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,679
Mister.

567
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:53,280
- Gosh, I couldn't help it.
- I was so surprised.

568
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,190
(Anhyun Shopping Mall)

569
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:10,969
(Antiques)

570
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,510
I told you not to leave anything out.

571
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,610
But that's all you gave me.

572
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,679
- Come on.
- Okay.

573
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,320
You know this isn't enough.

574
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,320
Then, I'll buy more for you. Don't worry.

575
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,559
Buy us the good stuff.

576
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,590
Okay, fine.

577
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:40,260
Oh, is the next deal
the day after tomorrow?

578
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,929
Yes, that's right.

579
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,269
Okay. Prepare for it well.

580
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:45,530
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

581
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,039
Police, don't move.

582
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,619
Stay still.

583
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,769
Detective Kim,
how did you know about this place?

584
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,010
Just relax, guys.

585
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:39,389
What could've brought our Detective Kim
to this place?

586
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:43,130
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong.
Why did you get him addicted?

587
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:44,760
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong?

588
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,530
What, is he addicted?

589
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,699
I know everything,
so let's not waste our time.

590
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,170
Why did you do it?

591
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,039
I don't think you know everything.

592
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:00,739
So,

593
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,650
how is Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong now?

594
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,079
Has he ended up in the hospital
or something?

595
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,619
CEO Yoon.

596
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,489
It wasn't us.

597
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,920
What would we gain...

598
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,519
from giving Jang Jae Gyeong pills?
Don't you think?

599
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Was it really not you?

600
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,889
No.

601
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,269
Where did you get
the Lemon Mulberry pills from?

602
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,369
The wholesale dealer is Gong Jin Wook.

603
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,110
The guy who makes them
is called the Doctor.

604
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,670
I've never seen him, though.

605
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,940
Where is Gong Jin Wook?

606
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,510
I don't know that either.

607
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,650
CEO Yoon.

608
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,619
You're not doing as you promised me.

609
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,420
Didn't we promise that there would be
no more drug issues in Anhyun...

610
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,960
if we took care of
the Five Spider Gang for you? But...

611
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,760
You remember different from me.

612
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,530
That wasn't a promise.

613
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:58,769
It was a deal.

614
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,340
If it had been a promise,
it would've been free.

615
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,110
I've given you everything I should,

616
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,010
and you've got everything you should.
Isn't that right?

617
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,650
We'll deal with our business on our own.

618
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,789
If you get to know this field
too deeply as a detective,

619
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,090
it won't be good for you.

620
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,489
Jang Jae Gyeong was
acting up too much too.

621
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,860
Well, I don't have anything more
to tell you.

622
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,929
Why don't you give me something
while you're here?

623
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,469
Do you know someone called Kim Dae Sung?

624
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,639
I caught him
dealing Lemon Mulberry pills yesterday.

625
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,639
Isn't he one of your guys?

626
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,739
He's a guy who works for Gong Jin Wook.
A little guy.

627
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,980
I see.

628
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,280
Find out the whereabouts of Gong Jin Wook
and let me know by this week.

629
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,289
Kim Chang Soo.

630
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:07,869
Here's a month's worth...

631
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,670
of our business operating expenses.

632
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,010
And you find Gong Jin Wook on your own.

633
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:17,849
That's your job.

634
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,050
Let's call...

635
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,019
when we have stuff
to help each other out with, okay?

636
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,289
Don't keep coming to me
whenever you need something.

637
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:27,289
Okay?

638
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,769
Why didn't I ask that?

639
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
Pardon?

640
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:43,210
That night.

641
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,309
When the Doctor called...

642
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,980
I was so excited
about making a direct deal...

643
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,519
that I didn't ask why we had to feed
Jang Jae Gyeong drugs...

644
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,750
and drop him off at a subway station.

645
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:00,760
I forgot to ask that.

646
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:24,010
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

647
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,289
Jeong Sang Eui.

648
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,139
Hey, it's me.

649
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Yes, what?

650
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:50,139
The server found
in the murder case at the mill...

651
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,780
The NFS tried to save it, but...

652
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,610
they failed.

653
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,110
Thankfully, they didn't find anything.

654
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,550
That's good.

655
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,150
I'm meeting Mayor Joo In Sang
later in the evening.

656
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
What?

657
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,090
Today?

658
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,630
Why did you schedule it so suddenly?

659
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,389
It just happened.

660
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,199
That guy was making such a fuss
saying he didn't have time.

661
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,739
What should I say to him when I meet him?

662
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,670
What time did you say you'd meet?

663
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
At 8 p.m.

664
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,750
Okay, I'll go over to PIlo-dong
around 5 p.m.

665
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,179
Okay.

666
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,860
(Prosecutor's Office,
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin)

667
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,570
What are all these?

668
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,510
These are pictures of taxis
coming out of the alleyway...

669
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,079
on the day that
the mill owner was murdered.

670
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:04,809
- Taxis?
- Yes.

671
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,019
I was going to tell you before,

672
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,320
but I forgot to and left it out.

673
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,750
On the day of the incident,

674
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,190
Jang Jae Gyeong said something to me
at the crime scene.

675
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,059
The suspect will be a taxi driver...

676
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:20,429
or the accomplice will be a taxi driver.

677
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,769
What did you say?

678
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:26,139
Well, I'm not sure what made him say that,

679
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,139
but he said that with such certainty.

680
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:31,510
Well, I didn't look into it...

681
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,539
- just because Jang Jae Gyeong said so...
- Isn't it important to know...

682
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:34,739
what made him say that?

683
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Yes.

684
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,650
So...

685
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,949
did you finish investigating?

686
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,789
I didn't find anything in particular.

687
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,420
Inspector Yoo,
is this what you came to tell me?

688
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,190
I thought I should...

689
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,329
report everything
related to Jang Jae Gyeong.

690
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,030
Jang Jae Gyeong said...

691
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:03,940
the taxi driver was the culprit
or at least an accomplice?

692
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:05,769
Yes.

693
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,079
(A drugless clean city, Anhyun)

694
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,619
You could just explain it to me.
Why do you always print things out?

695
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,780
What if someone sees?

696
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:17,449
It's just a habit from my job.

697
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,460
Mayor Joo In Sang got his bachelor's
at Seoul National University.

698
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,789
He received a government scholarship...

699
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:24,829
to get his doctorate in biology
at Stanford University in the U.S.

700
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,599
And he used to be a professor
at a national university.

701
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,099
He went into politics in 2010
through Assemblyman Jang Jung Ho.

702
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:33,840
He's considered one of the bio experts
in the Central Party.

703
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,239
He's ambitious, and he's said to have
good administrative power.

704
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:39,269
What about his family?

705
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,179
Nothing much.

706
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:45,179
- Weaknesses?
- I haven't found anything in particular.

707
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:47,320
But to pick one,

708
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,820
Mayor Yoo Eui Je in Hwansung,
the city nearby,

709
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,489
is aiming to develop
a bioindustry complex.

710
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,090
They were in the same bachelor's program
and the same department.

711
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,760
They're just one year apart.

712
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,289
But they're not close.

713
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,929
Using their rivalry to our advantage...

714
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:01,960
will be key to our strategy.

715
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:08,170
Does he like money?

716
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,469
Who doesn't like that?

717
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,670
Right.

718
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,079
What happened with Vice President
Han Sung Hoon of Yigu Electronics?

719
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,309
He said he'd ask his father.

720
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,579
Then let's see how they react
instead of telling them everything today.

721
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:24,050
Okay.

722
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,530
- What do you want?
- What are you doing here?

723
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,699
I told him to come.

724
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:45,809
(Keumhyung, Tomorrow's solution)

725
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,489
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

726
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:18,769
(KH Pharmaceutical)

727
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,219
Park Jun Seo.

728
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,480
Did you kill him?

729
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,860
No.

730
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:39,190
You seem to know who did.

731
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,099
I don't.

732
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:43,670
Then why did you go to Pilo-dong...

733
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:47,000
on February 23, the day Jun Seo died?

734
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:50,869
I guess you know that I went there.

735
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,550
Then why don't you arrest me?

736
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,480
Are you not certain...

737
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:03,750
that I killed Jun Seo?

738
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,320
Are you playing games with me?

739
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,719
Why did you go there?

740
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:10,630
Jun Seo told me to come.

741
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,159
Jun Seo told you to come?

742
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,030
No.

743
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,000
Not just me.

744
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,500
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
and Oh Chi Hyun.

745
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,670
He told all of us to come to that place
by 11:30 p.m.

746
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:27,809
What?

747
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,710
What are you...

748
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,380
saying right now?

749
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,150
It's just as I said.

750
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,320
The owner of the Pilo-dong mill.

751
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,320
Jeong Yoon Ho killed him.

752
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,219
You...

753
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:44,530
Are you insane?

754
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,030
Are you out of your mind?

755
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:48,630
Jong Soo.

756
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,530
I had no other choice.

757
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:52,429
There was a security camera there.

758
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,440
You...

759
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,409
Jong Soo.

760
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,210
Jong Soo.

761
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,039
Hey, Oh Chi Hyun.

762
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,150
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him
to make sure he doesn't cause trouble?

763
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,949
Is this what you call
keeping an eye on him?

764
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,480
Oh Chi Hyun. You lied.

765
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,190
You knew, didn't you?

766
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,360
That he killed the owner.

767
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,960
Did you know?

768
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,070
Why didn't you tell me, you bastard?

769
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:29,400
You heard so today.

770
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,940
If things go wrong,
it's not just me who will go down.

771
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,539
Do you think Won Chang Ho,
that cold person,

772
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:34,980
will throw me to the curb
and be done with it?

773
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,949
That'll be the end of you too!

774
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,519
How could you do this?

775
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:46,090
How can you call yourselves my friends?

776
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,090
Jong Soo. Calm down.

777
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,420
Come here.

778
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:53,730
- Jong Soo.
- Hey.

779
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,199
You...

780
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,030
Doing that won't change anything,
so calm down.

781
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:59,570
What were you doing?

782
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,840
What did you do
until things got this bad, you idiot?

783
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:04,309
Jong Soo.

784
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,010
Just kill this punk.

785
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,039
Just kill him and bury him
so nobody can find the culprit.

786
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,550
Okay?

787
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,750
Let's do that.

788
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
Let's kill him.

789
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:25,559
What I was most worried about
from the beginning...

790
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:27,599
was whether we were caught
on the security camera.

791
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,730
Regardless of whether he did it
on purpose or not,

792
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,269
everything is gone
because the server burned up.

793
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:35,369
I looked into things with the police,

794
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:38,469
and they didn't even have evidence
to suspect Jeong Yoon Ho.

795
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,610
But...

796
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,980
What causes
our biggest anxiety still remains.

797
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,679
So let's kill him.

798
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,219
Chi Hyun.

799
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,119
Burying is the cleanest way, right?

800
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,590
Dead people won't talk.

801
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,500
Right?

802
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:06,670
I won't say anything.

803
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:08,239
I mean it.

804
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:10,869
I really live...

805
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,239
as if I'm dead.

806
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,940
Tae Jin.

807
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:17,880
Jong Soo.

808
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:21,449
I'll really live as if I'm dead.

809
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,449
I mean it.

810
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,320
- Jeong Yoon Ho.
- Yes?

811
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,630
I'm kidding, punk.

812
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:36,260
Get up.

813
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,869
It's not easy to kill a friend.

814
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,170
I don't want to make Si Jung a widow.

815
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,539
Right?

816
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,809
But...

817
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,409
Yoon Ho.

818
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,280
I'm going to keep my eye on you,

819
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:54,750
so let's move on from this incident.

820
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,119
Okay?

821
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:58,250
Okay.

822
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,690
Hey.

823
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,059
Make sure to keep this punk
out of my sight.

824
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,530
Don't even mention his name
in front of me. Got it?

825
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,199
Okay.

826
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,440
Get lost, you bastard.

827
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:32,090
Are you saying the phone records...

828
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,289
with Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
and Oh Chi Hyun...

829
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,789
left on Jun Seo's phone...

830
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:38,030
were calls Jun Seo made to tell them
to come to that place by 11:30 p.m.?

831
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,460
Yes.

832
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,760
Why didn't he call you?

833
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,900
There were no calls with you
on the record.

834
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,230
You weren't invited.

835
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,500
So why did you go there?

836
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:51,210
I was next to Jun Seo
when he called them for the last time.

837
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,969
You were next to Jun Seo?

838
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,510
Then did you also hear
what he said to Won Jong Soo,

839
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,809
Park Tae Jin, and Oh Chi Hyun
on those calls?

840
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
No.

841
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,289
He called outside of the car,
so I don't know what he said.

842
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:06,090
But I'm certain
that he called those three.

843
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,340
What are you planning to do?

844
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,909
What are you going to say to them now?

845
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:30,380
I want you to come...

846
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,349
to that place at 11:30 p.m.

847
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,349
They won't just sit and watch.
It's too dangerous.

848
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,920
I still have to do this.

849
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,789
This might be...

850
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,860
our last chance.

851
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,769
So I went there at 11:30 p.m. too.

852
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,269
There was nowhere to park,

853
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:55,300
so I took a taxi
and got out on the main road.

854
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,780
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

855
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,889
I was about ten minutes early,
but I wasn't the first to arrive.

856
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,159
Who's there?

857
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,269
Jeong Sang Eui?

858
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,500
It's you, Tae Jin.

859
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:29,039
Did Jun Seo tell you to come here too?

860
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,909
Yes.

861
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:35,210
That looks like a switch.

862
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:36,409
Will you flip it?

863
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,210
Okay.

864
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:48,219
That'll do.

865
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,070
What's this?

866
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:06,309
He called you to come too?

867
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
And Park Jun Seo.

868
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,949
Where was he then?

869
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,150
Upstairs.

870
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:18,519
"Upstairs?"

871
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,420
He was on the ninth floor.

872
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:22,989
Did you go to the ninth floor?

873
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,360
Did you meet Jun Seo there?

874
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,030
On the first floor.

875
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,170
That's where we met.

876
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:49,019
(Beware of falling objects)

877
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,320
(Beware of falling objects)

878
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,320
But...

879
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,420
at the time,

880
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,489
no one saw it.

881
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,900
(Connection)

882
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:15,670
(April 2005)

883
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,869
A one-month suspension?

884
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:17,869
(Notice Board)

885
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,840
(Disciplinary Committee Decision)

886
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,849
(For continued assault and extortion)

887
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:25,780
(Year 3 Class 6 Chae Kyung Tae,
1 month suspension)

888
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,780
Attention.

889
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,980
Bow to the teacher.

890
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:30,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

891
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,590
Darn that punk Kyung Tae.

892
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,059
- Class president.
- Yes?

893
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,860
Tell Kyung Tae that even though
he was suspended,

894
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,900
he should come
to the teachers' office at least, okay?

895
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,130
He needs to graduate!

896
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,800
Doesn't he want to?

897
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,940
Okay.

898
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:54,409
The midterm exams start next week.

899
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,980
Study hard in preparation!

900
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,380
Okay?

901
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

902
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,190
Kyung Tae is such a pain.

903
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,159
I like studying in our club room
because it feels like a cafe.

904
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,159
- Right?
- Yes.

905
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:10,559
Will you stay until ten as usual?

906
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,360
I will stay,

907
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,900
but the music actually distracts me.

908
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,260
Do you want earplugs?

909
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,130
Jun Seo.

910
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,269
Hey.

911
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:23,909
My tutor told me to come over
and study the chapter highlights.

912
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:28,380
Come with me.

913
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,309
I promised to study
in our club room with the others.

914
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,619
Jun Seo.

915
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:35,519
I'll come next time.

916
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,590
Let's go.

917
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,869
(Connection)

918
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:34,840
A resident saw the taxi
on the day of the murder.

919
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,750
We should look into all the taxis here.

920
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,980
Are we putting together
a joint investigation task force?

921
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
You're not...

922
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,719
asking me to pretend
to be a druggie, are you?

923
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,219
Where are you going? Hey!

924
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,860
Did they suspect anyone?

925
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,829
Someone reported seeing a driver
wiping blood off their hands.

926
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:53,230
Jun Seo killed himself.

927
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,860
Are you making an alibi for the others?

928
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:59,099
Why would Jun Seo step up
and apologize then silence himself?

929
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:00,199
Who was it?

930
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,199
Jeong Sang Eui! Speak up!

931
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,869
I don't know. I really don't know!

932
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:06,469
It's your last chance. Tell me.

933
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:09,780
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Jeong Sang Eui. You were all together.

934
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,050
Did you know there was a camera?

935
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,610
Why did you kill Park Jun Seo?

936
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,349
I'm sorry.

937
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,750
Forgive me.

938
01:00:21,289 --> 01:00:23,320
