1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,280
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,849
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,570
What took you so long?

4
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:32,969
Where's the drug?

5
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,189
Is it Jeong Yoon Ho?

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

7
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,659
Who reported it?

8
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,700
They didn't want to reveal their identity.

9
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,439
They only reported the location
where the body was found.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,469
From their voice, we presume them
to be in their 50s or 60s.

11
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,010
- Did you track the number?
- It was a payphone.

12
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,579
A case like this means...

13
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,450
they witnessed the body get buried, right?

14
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,650
They likely saw the face of the criminal.

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,579
Check all the security cameras
around the area.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
Okay.

17
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,090
This isn't by a hiking trail.

18
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,689
What was the witness doing here?

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,930
I found a shoe here!

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,980
This shoe.

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,079
Compare it to the footprints
from the mill murder.

22
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,079
Okay.

23
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,890
What's that?

24
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,390
Isn't this a mono maple tree sap pouch?

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,599
This is what the caller came here for.

26
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,819
(Speed)

27
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,389
The biggest risk this project has
isn't Joo In Sang or Jong Soo.

28
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,259
It's you.

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,000
All you merely had were ten cows.

30
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,939
Your family couldn't even afford
to feed them.

31
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,139
I took their only son...

32
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,280
and poured my money into him
to turn him into a human.

33
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,280
What a work of art you've become.

34
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,020
(Won Jong Soo)

35
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,090
Hey, Jong Soo.

36
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:08,789
Where are you?

37
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,000
At the gym. Why?

38
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,360
You're trying hard to live long.

39
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,400
Let's drink to celebrate a good day.

40
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,969
Weren't you with Han Sung Hoon?

41
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,939
It's odd how I don't feel like
hanging out with him.

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
Come to Pilo-dong.

43
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,039
Well,

44
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,050
I'd like the night off. See you tomorrow.

45
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,050
Tae Jin.

46
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,580
Be there.

47
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,580
I have something to say.

48
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,490
Okay. I'll be there.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,770
Who do you think killed Jeong Yoon Ho?

50
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,979
Right now, I suspect everyone.

51
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,550
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
and Oh Chi Hyun.

52
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,449
Why are all your friends so messed...

53
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,719
But then...

54
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,189
I'm not in the position to say that.

55
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,860
What do we do about Chang Soo?

56
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,459
Let's look into it quietly.

57
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,029
Who can we ask?

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Soo Hyun.

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,069
Are you sure?

60
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,300
She's close to Chang Soo.

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,740
She can separate work and friendship.
It'll be fine.

62
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,810
What about tomorrow's Manpyeong Port raid?

63
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,939
Do we take Chang Soo?

64
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,850
We made it look like one of us
was leaving with Gong Jin Wook.

65
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,980
We need someone
Gong Jin Wook doesn't know...

66
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,350
to go undercover.

67
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,790
Let's take him.

68
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,250
I feel bothered.

69
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,920
I can't read him anymore.

70
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,829
It's not for sure yet.

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,800
(Connection)

72
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,019
Hey.

73
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,160
What's going on?

74
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,360
Did you sell drugs behind my back?

75
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,129
Darn you.

76
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,610
I didn't know you were such a backstabber.

77
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,209
On his knees.

78
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,120
I heard a lemon-colored pill
was all the rage,

79
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,019
and I really wanted to try it.

80
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,620
It was
"made in Keumhyung Pharmaceutical."

81
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,759
This punk said...

82
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,629
it was made with
the same raw materials as mine.

83
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,930
If you got caught,

84
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,329
were you going to reveal
the manufacturing lab,

85
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,500
put the blame on me,

86
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,269
and get off scot-free, you psycho?

87
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,509
We should've killed him, not Yoon Ho.

88
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,680
Hey. Because you came from...

89
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
a family that had nothing,

90
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,379
I thought you'd have
a sense of justice that I didn't.

91
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,060
But what are you really?

92
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,660
What was in this head of yours...

93
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,459
that you'd do something so darn sneaky?

94
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,290
Hey.

95
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,959
Why...

96
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,100
do you think...

97
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,870
I did everything you said...

98
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,199
without a complaint?

99
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,569
Because we were friends?

100
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,709
You know better than anyone
it's not that, you dirtbag.

101
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,379
So what?

102
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,779
Hey.

103
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,420
If we take away the fact...

104
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,920
you're the heir to Keumhyung Group,
you're nothing at all.

105
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,490
You're stupid and have no guts.

106
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,930
All you have is greed.

107
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,730
If it hadn't been for your father,

108
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,660
I'd have made it so you could
never look me in the eye.

109
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,100
Oh Chi Hyun.

110
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,699
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,110
You were the best fighter
in all of Anhyun.

112
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,379
Why do you work for the likes of him?

113
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,139
Because of your outstanding friendship?

114
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,110
Aren't you in it for the money too?

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Park Tae Jin.

116
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,490
Did that hurt?

117
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,259
I heard you couldn't breathe
if you got hit in that spot.

118
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,329
Did that hurt? Did it?

119
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,160
I'll kill you.

120
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:41,829
So,

121
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,800
do you feel better now that
you've spoken your mind after 20 years?

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hey.

123
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,040
What do you think that changes?

124
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,839
Nothing changes.

125
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,250
Does it change the fact
that you sold drugs...

126
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,279
or that I'm filthy rich?

127
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,750
Where's the cash?

128
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,050
Where's the money you made
from selling my stuff?

129
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,720
Zero, six, one, seven.

130
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
What?

131
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,889
Zero, six, one, seven.

132
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,800
That's the first half of the password.

133
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,129
I don't know the other half. Why?

134
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,269
Because Park Jun Seo took it to the grave.

135
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,709
What are you on about?

136
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,410
Tell it to me straight.

137
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,579
That money!

138
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,379
No one can get it out.

139
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,720
No one can get it
unless Jun Seo comes back to life!

140
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,950
Do you get it?

141
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Hey.

142
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,129
Darn you!

143
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,029
Is that true?

144
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,470
Is Jun Seo the only one
who knows the other half of the code?

145
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,039
This happened because you and Jun Seo...

146
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,750
called each other friends
and tried to work as equals.

147
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,679
This is why hierarchy is important!

148
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,919
Why did you two morons
have to split that precious code?

149
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
You're laughing?

150
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,129
Jong Soo.

151
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,730
Who do you think...

152
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,399
was superior?

153
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,669
Go and get the pills.

154
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,980
What?

155
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,039
You sold the stuff...

156
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,049
without knowing what happened
when you took it, right?

157
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,580
You should taste whatever it is
you're selling.

158
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,620
Get it now!

159
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,220
What are you going to do, Jong Soo?

160
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,820
Film him taking the drug.

161
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,059
Film his eyes glaze over...

162
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,830
and him crawling and groveling for more.

163
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,860
That will stop him
from pulling something like this again.

164
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,470
Get the stuff.

165
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,370
Darn it.

166
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,480
That goes for you too.

167
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,019
Hey. You should've reported to me first.

168
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,720
I pay you, so how dare you
wag your tail for someone else?

169
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,730
I'll let you taste what you made too.

170
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Tae Jin.

171
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,070
You know,

172
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,440
I wouldn't be friends with you
if it weren't for my old man.

173
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,850
Punks who act out
because they have brains?

174
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,980
I hate them.

175
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:47,720
It was always,

176
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,320
"What did Tae Jin say?"

177
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,860
"Do as Tae Jin says."

178
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,220
"Learn from Tae Jin."

179
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,830
I was just sick of it.

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,200
But you know,

181
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,129
I did my best...

182
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,669
to try to get on with you.

183
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,210
Knowing that someone smart like you...

184
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,309
did my bidding...

185
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,379
was pleasing sometimes.

186
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,179
But your crucial mistake was...

187
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,820
You tried to become me.

188
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,690
There's only one Won Jong Soo
who's the son of Won Chang Ho!

189
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,629
That's why you ended up
in this state today. Get it?

190
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,470
It's in the Students' Creed
that my father made too.

191
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,970
"Be someone who performs one's duty."

192
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,779
Have you forgotten?

193
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,200
Jong Soo.

194
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,309
Jong Soo.

195
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,269
Jong Soo!

196
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,720
What will happen now?

197
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,269
I'm going to wipe them all out.

198
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,629
Then what about me?

199
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,340
Shouldn't you also wipe me out
in order for you to be safe?

200
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,169
Give me your phone.

201
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Give it here.

202
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
Sang Eui.

203
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,009
I'll give you 12 hours from now.

204
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,649
If you have any pictures or recordings,
get rid of them during that time...

205
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:04,820
and go abroad.

206
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,549
I'll call you once things are sorted.

207
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,120
This isn't a threat.
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

208
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,730
Joo Song.

209
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,009
Why? Is something wrong?

210
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,809
You...

211
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,539
Why?

212
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,250
Just get in.

213
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,370
How could you keep
something like that from me?

214
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,269
Can you not trust me?

215
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Hey.

216
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,470
How is that a matter of trust?

217
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,210
If you were him...

218
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,139
"Hey, I'm addicted to drugs."

219
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,779
"Will you help me?"
Would you say something like that?

220
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:14,080
I told you that I only found out
by pure chance.

221
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,250
But still.

222
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,690
Didn't you think that
you should've told me sooner...

223
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,090
so that we could look for
a solution together?

224
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,389
What good is a friend
if you can't even tell me such things?

225
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Then,

226
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,100
do you still get the urge
to take drugs now?

227
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,970
No.

228
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,570
Do you know...

229
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,110
when you get those withdrawal symptoms
or whatever?

230
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,909
Do withdrawal symptoms
announce themselves before they come?

231
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,350
Is that so?

232
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,750
Hey, should I drive?

233
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,820
No, it's fine.
I'll let you know if I get tired.

234
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,710
Anyone home?

235
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,620
Hello?

236
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,950
Is no one home?

237
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,889
I don't think anyone is here.

238
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,870
Are you Ms. Yoon Sung Mi?

239
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,710
Yes.

240
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,409
Detective Jang Jae Gyeong?

241
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,379
Reporter Oh Yoon Jin?

242
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm Heo Joo Song.

243
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
Oh, right.

244
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,190
I'm...

245
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,190
No Gyu Min.

246
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,029
February 23,

247
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:07,630
licence plate 35A0233.

248
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,670
Could you tell me the driver
who was driving at the time?

249
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,700
It was No Gyu Min.

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,309
You're the taxi driver
who drove Jun Seo...

251
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,210
to the construction site the last time.

252
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:19,809
Yes, that's me.

253
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,920
You're Chae Kyung Tae's mother, right?

254
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:31,720
I've told her about Jun Seo.

255
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,759
Did Jun Seo come here often?

256
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,630
Yes, well...

257
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,059
I think he came here
about once every two months or so.

258
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,430
Gyu Min, how do you know
Kyung Tae and Jun Seo?

259
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,970
I was friends with Kyung Tae
to begin with.

260
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,470
Give me a lighter.

261
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Here.

262
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,910
After Kyung Tae died like that,

263
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,309
I met Jun Seo afterward.

264
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,920
Where?

265
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:59,619
Jun Seo...

266
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,990
He came to see me.

267
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,490
It must've been over ten years ago.

268
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,930
I don't know how he found me.

269
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Ma'am.

270
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Who...

271
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,670
Are you...

272
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,839
Kyung Tae's friend from back then?

273
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,069
Yes.

274
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,750
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,319
- He said...
- It's okay.

277
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,359
he should've stopped Kyung Tae's death.

278
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,829
- I'm sorry.
- But he said he wasn't able to.

279
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,269
He stood there and cried for a long time.

280
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,779
You must be hungry.

281
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,619
I'll go and get some stuff...

282
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,650
- No.
- It's fine.

283
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,789
No, it's because I'm feeling hungry.

284
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,490
But it's fine.

285
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,690
When Jun Seo was...

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
on his way to
the Pilo-dong construction site,

287
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,960
did he say anything else in the taxi?

288
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,269
No, he didn't say anything.

289
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
But...

290
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,450
He told me to give this to you...

291
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,309
when you guys came by.

292
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,680
What is...

293
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,220
on here?

294
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,099
It was a long time ago,

295
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,569
but some guy came...

296
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,140
and asked to watch
the CCTV like you, detective.

297
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,309
He asked if he could get a copy.

298
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,210
So, I told him to go ahead.

299
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,940
Jun Seo already knew...

300
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,509
that Oh Chi Hyun and Jeong Yoon Ho
had killed Lee Myung Guk.

301
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,410
That was why Sang Eui...

302
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,380
Lee Myung Guk's corpse.

303
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,019
"Lee Myung Guk's corpse?"

304
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,319
Did you put it back in his home?

305
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:19,690
By yourself?

306
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,589
With No Gyu Min.

307
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:25,829
You moved Lee Myung Guk's corpse
with Jeong Sang Eui, didn't you?

308
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,099
You must've met Sang Eui.

309
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,609
But how did you know...

310
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,970
they would move Lee Myung Guk's corpse
outside Youngryun Cold Storage?

311
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,210
Sang Eui said he heard what Jun Seo said.

312
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,650
So, I waited.

313
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,119
It was past 1 a.m.

314
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,190
(The day of Park Jun Seo's death)

315
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,690
He said that Jun Seo had died
at the construction site...

316
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
and that I had to go back there.

317
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,490
I met Sang Eui there, and a little later,

318
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,930
Jeong Yoon Ho's taxi came out from
the alley where the mill was.

319
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,599
I saw him going into the alley
where Youngryun Cold Storage is.

320
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,269
When I got there,
Oh Chi Hyun and Jeong Yoon Ho...

321
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,710
came out with Lee Myung Guk's corpse.

322
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,480
So, that was why we tailed them.

323
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh Chi Hyun was there too?

324
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:17,349
Yes.

325
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,759
What are you doing?

326
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,430
We'll search and seize

and there will be a stairwell going down.

The passcode is 3-8-0-8.

332
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,750
This was a site where drugs were produced.

333
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,049
Please take extra caution.

334
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,059

We can't get through
to Prosecutor Park Tae Jin's phone.

344
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,000
It must be because he's searching

What on earth are you talking about?

346
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,970
Contact PR
and have them block any news reports.

by all means possible.

Tae Jin is searching

Tae Jin that jerk had been making
and selling drugs.

356

at our company to sell them.

00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,859
I guess Jun Seo never got to tell you.

366
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:47,329
I told him it would be a good idea
to tell Inspector Jang or Ms. Oh,

367
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,829
but Jun Seo delayed doing it.

368
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,099
He said he'd tell you
when the time was right.

369
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,640
(April, 2005)

370
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,140
- What is this?
- What?

371
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,640
What are you looking at?

372
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Darn it.

373
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,420
Are you crazy?

374
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,150
It happened in a flash.

375
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,759
The boys...

376
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,329
must've knocked over the oil burner
while beating Kyung Tae.

377
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,559
Oh Chi Hyun, pull him up.

378
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,099
Take your dirty hands off me.

379
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:22,829
Hey.

380
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,339
Kyung Tae, you should know your place.

381
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,740
- Wait.
- Let go!

382
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,339
- Let go!
- Wait.

383
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,650
Hey.

384
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,579
He's not breathing.

385
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,950
What?

386
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,460
Darn it. Let's go.

387
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,359
We have to get out!

388
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,289
Chi Hyun.

389
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,630
Let's go.

390
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,509
Darn it!

391
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,680
Where is it?

392
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,720
Help me, Jong Soo...

393
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,210
Gosh.

394
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:50,549
Kyung Tae.

395
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:53,819
Kyung Tae...

396
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:54,819
Kyung Tae, wake up.

397
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,430
Chae Kyung Tae! Wake up...

398
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,160
No... Kyung Tae.

399
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Kyung Tae.

400
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,930
Kyung Tae.

401
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,069
Kyung Tae, no. Kyung Tae...

402
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,299
(Won Jong Soo)

403
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,980
(Won Jong Soo)

404
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,579
Won Jong Soo had returned
for his name tag.

405
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,019
His name tag?

406
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:20,549
Yes.

407
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,650
Where is it right now?

408
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,720
I gave it to Jun Seo.

409
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,490
Why aren't you asking me the question?

410
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,099
I had the name tag,

411
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,529
and I witnessed the whole incident.

412
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:36,930
Why aren't you asking
why I didn't report it?

413
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,839
I thought you of all people would ask me.

414
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,940
You were forced to transfer because of it.

415
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,690
I've only set what we had.

416
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,089
Please go ahead and eat.

417
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,430
Okay. Thank you for the food.

418
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,430
Jae Gyeong.

419
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,130
When Jun Seo heard...

420
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,740
the whole story from Gyu Min,

421
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,269
I bet he was heartbroken.

422
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,880
So it was never an accident to begin with.

423
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,950
It's late,

424
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,519
but we should still try everything we can.

425
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,549
A long time ago,

426
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:34,490
we visited Jun Seo's mother's family.

427
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,059
It's the first time...

428
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,430
seeing the ocean together since then.

429
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,700
(Summer, 2005)

430
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,269
This looks like the right place.

431
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,140
Are we going the right way?

432
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:51,809
Jun Seo!

433
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,940
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yes.

434
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,880
- I don't think I need to eat it.
- Hey!

435
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,650
- Jun Seo!
- Jun Seo!

436
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,490
- What are you doing here alone?
- Exactly.

437
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,519
Why are you here?

438
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,019
Because we missed you.

439
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,029
You traveled so far.

440
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,839
Thank you.

441
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,779
Why did you leave without a word?

442
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
No reason.

443
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Do you feel better...

444
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,690
now that you're here?

445
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,799
What do you think?

446
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,400
You left...

447
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,769
as soon as summer break started.

448
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,609
To be honest,

449
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,880
all of us felt a bit sad.

450
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,279
Jun Seo.

451
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,380
There's nothing friends can't share.

452
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,920
Are you going
to suffer through whatever it is alone?

453
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Park Jun Seo.

454
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,230
What did you see...

455
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,430
that day?

456
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:28,769
That day,

457
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,240
I heard the story for the first time
from Jun Seo.

458
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,250
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Oh Chi Hyun, and Jeong Yoon Ho.

459
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,079
The four of them were stunned...

460
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,019
and frozen standing in front...

461
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:45,119
of Chae Kyung Tae's burning house.

462
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,259
I got angry after hearing the story...

463
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,660
and tried to persuade him
that the incident must not be overlooked.

464
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,769
I told him we should report it
to the police together.

465
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,039
But even after summer break ended
and school resumed,

466
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,009
Jun Seo didn't go to the police.

467
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,410
So that was why you reported it.

468
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,210
I knew about it too.

469
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,079
That same night,

470
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,789
I heard everything too.

471
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,259
Kyung Tae was inside the burning house,

472
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,390
but no one thought to rescue him.

473
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,000
They just paced in front of it.

474
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,599
I wanted to give...

475
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,000
the two of you the time to talk,

476
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,940
so I acted like I was going to sleep.

477
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,940
I was curious too.

478
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,240
I felt that something had happened
to Jun Seo,

479
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,809
but he wouldn't say anything to me either.

480
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:50,950
I heard everything...

482
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,190
and watched you get forced to transfer,

483
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,029
but I could never find...

484
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:02,029
the courage.

485
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:07,069
I became a reporter after that.

486
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,569
I tried to be more courageous
to make up for that time...

487
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,940
and gave my best shots,

488
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:18,619
but I lost every time.

489
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,549
I know.

490
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:25,150
I'm not strong enough
to fight the unjust world.

491
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,089
I could turn a blind eye
and go on with my life.

492
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:36,099
But that didn't dilute the guilt
I felt for you and Jun Seo.

493
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,349
What about you?

494
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:59,990
Didn't you hear everything from your tent?

495
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,029
You went to sleep?

496
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Yes.

497
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:17,640
(Yoo Kyung Hwan)

498
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,049
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

499
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,920
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

500
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,299
(Manpyeong Port)

501
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:52,609
Captain Jang.

502
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,109
It's so windy by the sea.

503
00:32:58,819 --> 00:32:59,880
Where's Chang Soo?

504
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,779
I told him to get a motel room
and wait there.

505
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,250
Large groups tend to get noticed.

506
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,019
Did he say anything on the way?

507
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,289
No.

508
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,359
There was a lot
I wanted to ask but didn't.

509
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,130
I did some thinking on the way.

510
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,829
I think it's possible Chang Soo did...

511
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,900
what he did in that given situation.

512
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,369
Think about it.

513
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,440
Sit behind the wheel.

514
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,779
Let's act it out.

515
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,940
Go on.

516
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,849
Look. I'll do this.

517
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,319
Darn it.

518
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,950
Here.

519
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,890
What would you do
if Ko Gi Sung kicked you like that?

520
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,119
First, I'd block the kicks
with my right arm.

521
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,130
Then...

522
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:45,029
I'd try to pull over
to the side of the road.

523
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,660
Yes. You would.

524
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,329
And as we discussed before,

525
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,269
if he had kicked like that,
his body would've leaned to the left.

526
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:53,539
Kick me.

527
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,680
If that happened,
I wouldn't turn the wheel to the right.

528
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,380
If I leaned to the left, so would the car.

529
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,619
Look. Sit back up straight.

530
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,949
What if I kicked like this?

531
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,659
Plus, why would Chang Soo kill Ko Gi Sung?

532
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,260
Isn't there no motive?

533
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,360
I would hope so.

534
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,730
- Let's go inside and get ready.
- Okay.

535
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,269
Go on inside.

536
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,599
Bye.

537
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,409
Darn it.

538
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,719
Hey, I eat those when I drive.

539
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,250
- Do you?
- Yes.

540
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,190
- Do you want one?
- Yes.

541
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,530
It helps when you crave a coffee.

542
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:03,010
This place is quiet with few people.

543
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,739
Yes.

544
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,010
I wish I could move with Ye Eun...

545
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,309
to a quiet place like this.

546
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,579
Thinking of going back to that mess...

547
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,420
gives me a headache already.

548
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,329
I really don't get it.

549
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,829
What do you mean?

550
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,559
Jun Seo.

551
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,730
He knew he could die.

552
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,739
That's why he took out
an insurance policy in our names...

553
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,210
and left the USB flash drive
with No Gyu Min.

554
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:40,039
They were all fast friends,

555
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,250
but they tried to kill Jun Seo...

556
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,980
to keep their secret.

557
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,150
When you first told me
Jae Gyeong was addicted to drugs,

558
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,750
I blamed Jun Seo.

559
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,389
Think about it.

560
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,530
He got addicted
while looking into Jun Seo's death...

561
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,760
while you got kidnapped
and then almost died.

562
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,429
But today's visit to Boryeong...

563
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:07,070
made me realize
how lonely he must've felt.

564
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,710
He always seemed to be
surrounded by friends.

565
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,440
But it turned out...

566
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,280
the only friends he had...

567
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,449
were us three.

568
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:32,630
- Hi, Woo Sung.
- Where are you?

569
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,960
I'm on the way to Seoul. Why?

570
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,099
Things are crazy over here.

571
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:40,570
Prosecutors searched...

572
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,639
a cold storage unit
in Pilo-dong owned by...

573
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,010
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
and their head office.

574
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,639
What? And?

575
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,079
There's talk that they found
a drug manufacturing lab...

576
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,710
in the unit basement
and a large batch of drugs,

577
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,480
but Keumhyung Group is stopping
the media from reporting on it.

578
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,920
Their people...

579
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,989
have been here for two hours
arguing with our boss.

580
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,889
Okay. Keep me updated.

581
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:05,800
Is something wrong?

582
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,599
Park Tae Jin is finally on the move.

583
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,579
You must've been very busy today.

584
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,639
Why are you here?

585
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,480
You must've been busier than me...

586
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,550
trying to silence the press.

587
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,420
Park Tae Jin, you...

588
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,090
This isn't the only way.

589
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,590
There are many other options.

590
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,929
You seem to have a misunderstanding.

591
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:36,960
I doubt that.

592
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,400
But I do understand you, sir.

593
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,900
Even if I were you,

594
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,769
since the mayor approved the project,

595
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,199
you'd have no reason...

596
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,869
to keep a hound that bit its master.

597
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,809
That's where you're mistaken.

598
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:54,280
Chairman. I don't care.

599
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,809
Let me take Jong Soo.

600
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,820
- What, punk?
- You can't do that.

601
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,489
If you say Jong Soo went off the deep end,

602
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:05,019
the company will stay unscathed.

603
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,159
No.

604
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,900
(Mayor Joo In Sang)

605
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:16,699
Take it.

606
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,610
(Mayor Joo In Sang)

607
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,849
This is Chairman Won Chang Ho.

608
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,849
Mr. Mayor...

609
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,369
(Mayor Joo In Sang)

610
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,309
Mr. Mayor.

611
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,139
It's Anhyun prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

612
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,809
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin?

613
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,079
Why are you taking this call...

614
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,349
I'm here to apprehend CEO Won Jong Soo.

615
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,519
Are you? Is this true?

616
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,559
Did Won Jong Soo make,
take, and sell drugs?

617
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,860
What do you say?

618
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:20,030
Give me Jong Soo...

619
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,960
and your Pilo-dong project stays on track.

620
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,469
Shut your mouth, punk.

621
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:24,500
Hello?

622
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Prosecutor Park?

623
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:28,500
What's this about?

624
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,769
- Prosecutor Park?
- Sir.

625
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,940
I'll ask you one last time.

626
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:38,650
Is it Jong Soo...

627
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,920
or Keumhyung Group?

628
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,429
Father.

629
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,159
Hello?

630
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,329
Who says the project stays on track?

631
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,530
I never approved it, okay?

632
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,730
- Chairman.
- Father.

633
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
Father.

634
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:04,909
What...

635
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:16,949
Jong Soo.

636
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,690
No.

637
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,860
What... What are you doing?

638
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,559
How could you...

639
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,489
You won't go away for long.

640
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,300
What is this, Father?

641
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,699
I'm your only son.

642
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,599
This isn't right, Father!

643
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:38,110
I'm your son, not him!

644
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,710
How could you abandon me?

645
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:42,809
Jong Soo.

646
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,820
Make sure he isn't hurt or taken ill.

647
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,789
Yes, of course.

648
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,889
Father.

649
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:56,960
What on earth...

650
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,829
I'm sorry, Father.

651
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,860
- I won't do it again.
- Prosecutor Park.

652
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,260
What do you think you're doing?

653
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,070
- Father.
- I'm hanging up.

654
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,139
You're messing with the wrong person.
Do you know that?

655
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,000
Shut your mouth and listen up.

656
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,340
What? Are you out of your mind?

657
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,380
I sent two photos to your number.

658
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,179
Just 2 out of 38 very disgusting photos.

659
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,179
I sent one that would be
less embarrassing for others to see.

660
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:24,889
What...

661
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,230
The licensing
for the bioindustrial complex...

662
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,059
There's no problem with it.

663
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,269
And we never had this phone call.

664
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Can I assume that to be true?

665
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,570
Yes.

666
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,639
That is true.

667
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:04,659
Take him away.

668
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Let's go.

669
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,780
(Keumhyung Group)

670
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,760
Act naturally...

671
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,900
if you meet Gong Jin Wook
in front of Manyang Ferry.

672
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,500
Yes, sir. Are we going to ride
on Manyang Ferry?

673
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I don't know yet.

674
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,340
We could meet there
and move to another boat.

675
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:51,369
But can't we just arrest him
in front of Manyang Ferry?

676
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,880
Is it really necessary
to get on the boat with him?

677
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:56,309
What nonsense is he going on about now?

678
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,110
I told you earlier.

679
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,579
It's highly likely Gong Jin Wook is armed.

680
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,820
We won't provoke him
until you get on the boat with him.

681
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,320
If we fail to arrest him on land,
citizens might be in danger.

682
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,230
If he goes into
a store or someplace else...

683
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,590
and takes a hostage,
it'd be a problem.

684
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,590
Fix that line.

685
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,829
Once we get on the boat
and go out to sea...

686
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:16,900
See that seawall?

687
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,570
When we go beyond that seawall,

688
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,400
the coast guard
will apprehend the boat there.

689
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,010
Then, we'll arrest him on the boat.
That will be the safest.

690
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:25,369
You're right.
He won't have anywhere to run.

691
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,409
Be sure to wear your bulletproof vest.

692
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,150
Don't think of jumping in
even if you see an opportunity.

693
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:31,449
Yes, sir.

694
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,250
(Sergeant Oh Soo Hyun)

695
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,889
Hey, did you get anything?

696
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,889
That van where Ko Gi Sung died...

697
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:44,889
Yes?

698
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,829
There was a dashcam inside the car.

699
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,130
I thought we couldn't restore the footage.

700
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,039
We couldn't restore the sound,

701
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:55,900
but we got some of the video back,

702
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,409
so I just sent you the file.

703
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
You saw it, didn't you?

704
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,139
Did you get anything?

705
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,550
Take a look at the file,

706
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,280
and you can make your call.

707
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,719
Oh, okay.

708
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,650
Where did you go without me?

709
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,090
Where's your gun?

710
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Here.

711
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
What are you doing?

712
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,730
Kim Chang Soo.

713
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,539
You're under arrest for the murder
of Ko Gi Sung.

714
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,170
Captain.

715
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,539
You have the right to an attorney.

716
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:04,809
You will have a chance to defend yourself.

717
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:05,909
Captain, why are you doing this?

718
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,409
You may apply to have the legality
of your arrest reviewed.

719
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,380
You may refuse to make a statement.

720
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,380
You...

721
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,820
Why did you kill Ko Gi Sung?

722
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,690
Me?

723
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,190
Why would I kill Ko Gi Sung?

724
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,190
That day...

725
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,360
The day CEO Yoon died...

726
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,130
That wasn't the first time
you saw her, right?

727
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:32,840
I saw her for the first time.

728
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,599
And when would I ever meet CEO Yoon?

729
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:37,670
Seriously, why are you all doing this?

730
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,269
Watch.

731
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:40,840
See what you did.

732
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,179
Ko Gi Sung didn't attack
as you said in your statement.

733
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,650
In case the car door didn't open...

734
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,619
when you entered the water,

735
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,989
you rolled down
the driver's seat window beforehand.

736
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:34,829
Come in.

737
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,570
We're in the middle
of a stakeout right now.

738
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,800
Please take him into the precinct
as quietly as possible.

739
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,510
Someone will come
from Anhyeon Police Station...

740
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,039
to take the suspect.

741
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:20,710
So, what should I say when we meet
Gong Jin Wook?

742
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,840
Haven't you already thought of that?

743
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,849
Well,

744
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,320
should I say I'm a distributor
who used to deal drugs in Seoul...

745
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:27,949
but has to stow away?

746
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:28,949
Sounds good.

747
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,719
Gong Jin Wook might try
to take you hostage.

748
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:36,460
So, if something happens on the boat,
drop back, no matter what.

749
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:38,960
The coast guard
and I will make the arrest.

750
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,630
Stay away from Gong Jin Wook
at all times.

751
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,929
Gosh, fine.
Just mind your own business.

752
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,800
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

753
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Say something.

754
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,369
Forsythia. Water parsley.

755
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,070
Idiot Jang Jae Gyeong.
Come in, over.

756
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,280
I can hear you fine.

757
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,010
Here.

758
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,719
Well, I can't take it with me.

759
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:05,920
You never know, so hang onto it.

760
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:38,389
Can you hear me?

761
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:41,059
Yes, I can hear you fine.

762
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,130
(Manpyeong Port)

763
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,039
Did you find Manyang Ferry?

764
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:01,309
Not yet.

765
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,550
Hey. I found it.

766
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,880
(Manyang Ferry)

767
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:13,360
(Manyang Ferry)

768
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:35,909
Gong Jin Wook.

769
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,940
(Manyang Ferry)

770
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,750
Is this your first time?

771
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:14,719
What?

772
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,179
Smuggling out.

773
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,460
No wonder you're dressed so lightly.

774
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:23,730
It's super cold out at sea
at this time of the year.

775
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,289
I don't think it's something to boast.

776
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,829
It's better to have experience
than none at all.

777
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,230
Do you speak any Chinese?

778
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,699
No. Do you?

779
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,210
No.

780
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:01,059
It must have been troublesome to get here.

781
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,599
Are you two heading out
on Manyang Ferry today?

782
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,329
Who is it?

783
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,340
(Straw)

784
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,070
Yes.

785
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:18,880
- Yes?
- Your cover was blown.

786
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,980
They know the police sent someone.

787
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,090
They're going to leave Korea tonight,
so they'll use a different port.

788
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,519
Which one of you was sent here by Straw?

789
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,090
I see. Nice to meet you. Let's go.

790
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,510
Hurry, get in!

791
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,340
Darn it.

792
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:55,719
- Are you okay?
- Handcuffs.

793
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:58,150
- You startled me.
- Hurry.

794
00:52:18,909 --> 00:52:20,840
(Manpyeong Port)

795
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:33,190

(Sergeant Oh Soo Hyun)

797
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,590
- Yes, Captain.
- Soo Hyun.

798
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,059
I'm chasing the suspect's car
from Manpyeong Port.

799
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:41,599
Can you check what other ports are around?

800
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,630
Just a minute.

801
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,269
Hurry.

802
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,699
Ingok Port. There's the Ingok Port.

803
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,409
It's about 15km north from there.

804
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:53,440
"Ingok Port?"

805
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,710
(Ingok Port)

806
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,449
Call local patrol units for support.

807
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,219
Tell the coastal guard to head
to Ingok Port too.

808
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:05,619
Okay.

809
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,110
(Low-temperature Fisheries Storage)

810
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,119

(Poongi)

812
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:51,449
Gong Jin Wook!

813
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,599
Jang Jae Gyeong.

814
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,369
You're under arrest
for mismanagement of drugs.

815
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:45,510
You junkie.

816
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:06,460
(Connection)

817
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,699
(Connection)

818
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:45,699
Come with me.

819
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,170
Unit Chief Jeong, what are you doing?

820
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:48,800
Who are you calling a suspect? Come on.

821
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,809
That's just what you want to believe
Jun Seo would want.

822
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:53,010
That's not true, so shut your mouth.

823
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,239
No, you shut your mouth.

824
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,110
I'm going
to run this article no matter what.

825
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,550
The moment I get out, I'll kill you first!

826
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,679
This success should be something
we achieved together.

827
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:01,679
You're really something.

828
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,619
You were out of it then,
and you're still out of it now.

829
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,349
- Wake up.
- Park Tae Jin.

830
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:08,920
I'll do anything you ask,

831
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,460
- Jong Soo.
- Hey.

832
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:11,789
Jong Soo killed him.

833
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,599
He was set on killing Jun Seo.

834
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,960
Did you offer to help him?

835
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:18,269
Don't you know who I am?

836
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,869
He sponged off of his friends
and lived as a drug delivery man.

837
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,400
He had a pathetic life!

838
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,739
Wake up.

839
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:27,139
They found DNA
underneath Park Jun Seo's fingernails.

840
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,480
You know whose it is, don't you?

841
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,750
You claim you're taking revenge
for Jun Seo.

842
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,179
But perhaps he never wanted one.
