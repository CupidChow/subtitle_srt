00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,310
(April 2005)

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,679
Let's watch "Crying Fist."

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,250
"Innocent Steps" just came out
in theaters.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,250
Let's watch that.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,289
Hey, Joo Song.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,289
Our exams just ended.
"Innocent Steps?" What are you saying?

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,260
"Crying Fist" is the way to go.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,129
That's right.
I vote for "Crying Fist" too.

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,059
What about you?

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,199
I want to watch "Kingdom of Heaven."

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,269
Hey, that doesn't open in theaters
until next week.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,070
Really? Why did you hit me?

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,070
Hey, let's decide when we get there.

15
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,560
The class president went to see a movie
with Yoon Jin and Jae Gyeong.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,590
I can't even reach him.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,130
(Park Tae Jin)

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,100
Sang Eui.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,429
(Jeong Sang Eui)

20
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,429
Jeong Sang Eui!

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,939
Chae Kyung Tae.

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,109
Did that jerk take...

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,079
your money again?

24
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,890
(Park Tae Jin)

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,989
We're going on our own without Jun Seo.

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,640
(Forced expulsion is
oppression of our rights to live!)

27

(Oh Chi Hyun)

30

31

32
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,669
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,080
I arrived about ten minutes early,

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,379
but I wasn't the first to arrive.

35
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,590
Who's there?

36
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,689
Jeong Sang Eui?

37
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:32,860
It's you, Tae Jin.

38
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,289
Did Jun Seo tell you to come here too?

39
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,430
Yes.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,699
That looks like a switch.

41
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,930
Will you flip it?

42
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:44,699
Okay.

43
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,610
That'll do.

44
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,159
What's this?

45
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,330
He called you to come too?

46
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,900
What about Park Jun Seo?

47
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,000
Where was he then?

48
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,009
- Upstairs.
- "Upstairs?"

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,650
Explain further.

50
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,949
You guys arrived at the construction site,

51
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,979
and Park Jun Seo was
on the ninth floor. Correct?

52
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,819
Yes.

53
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,550
But how did you know
he was on the ninth floor?

54
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,719
The lights came on.

55
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,389
What time is it now?

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,699
It's almost 11:30 p.m.

57
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,569
What?

58
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,340
He must be up there.

59
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,240
Hey, Park Jun Seo!

60
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,909
Are you up there?

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,870
Come on down, punk!

62
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,949
(Seeing danger is
the first step to safety.)

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,979
We should go up.

64
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,250
Hey, how can we ride that?

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,550
Jun Seo went up by taking that too.

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,689
Hey.

67
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,949
(Beware of falling objects)

68
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,990
Darn it.

69
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,279
(Freight elevator)

70
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,500
Everyone must've been nervous
because no one was talking.

71
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,129
And I think we were passing
the fourth floor or so.

72
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:59,870
Just as we were looking over
at Pilo-dong through the wire mesh...

73
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,110
Did you see that?

74
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,060
We all tried to
look over the wire in shock,

75
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,160
but we couldn't see much.

76
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,360
That's when Jun Seo fell?

77
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,529
Yes.

78
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,100
Are you saying he killed himself?

79
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,649
Just when you guys were in the elevator,

80
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,779
Jun Seo jumped from the ninth floor?

81
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,149
I didn't say he jumped.

82
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,779
We only saw him fall.

83
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,779
Are you...

84
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,750
making an alibi for the others?

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,990
Who saw Jun Seo fall?

86
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,990
Did you see it too?

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,959
Jong Soo and Tae Jin saw it.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,829
So you didn't go to the ninth floor?

89
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,500
Tae Jin pressed the stop button.

90
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,870
Hey, Park Jun Seo. Are you up there?

91
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,339
Let's go down.

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,129
(Elevator Safety Protocol)

93
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,930
(Beware of falling objects)

94
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,439
(Beware of falling objects)

95
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,750
Who is it?

96
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,990
It's not Jun Seo, is it?

97
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,569
Is it Jun Seo?

98
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,699
Who is it?

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,610
It's Jun Seo.

100
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,209
Did you check too?

101
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,149
Yes.

102
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,490
Did you see with your own eyes
if Jun Seo was dead,

103
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,220
or did you assume he was dead?

104
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,389
Tae Jin went up to him
and checked his pulse.

105
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Tae Jin?

106
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,230
Then he said we should get out of there.

107
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,759
That it wouldn't help anyone if word
got out that we were there that late.

108
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,569
Tae Jin said that too?

109
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,639
Was it all Park Tae Jin?

110
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,870
You lot can't do anything without him.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,040
What then?

112
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,509
We all left the way we came in.

113
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,180
We went our separate ways
at the main road.

114
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,980
We found our own ways home.

115
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,290
You guys...

116
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,629
You did the same 20 years ago
when Chae Kyung Tae died.

117
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,459
You provided each other
with witness statements and alibis.

118
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,629
Do you think you can
get away with it this time?

119
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,699
Whether you believe me or not
is up to you.

120
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,269
If what you said is true,

121
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,939
Jun Seo called you all there
at 11:30 p.m. to say something.

122
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,139
He came to me before he died...

123
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,410
and said
he'd put everything back in order.

124
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,209
He said that only to jump
to his death right when...

125
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,209
you guys were on your way up?

126
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,480
Do you think that makes sense?

127
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,190
You guys in the elevator.

128
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,690
One is capable of killing others
without getting...

129
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,259
a drop of blood on their hands.

130
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,360
Another is capable of carrying out
a task as soon as the order is given.

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,759
And the third is capable
of covering it all up.

132
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,830
If just one of those three...

133
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,169
had a reason that what Jun Seo
wanted to say couldn't come out,

134
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,230
then it's possible.

135
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:52,769
You just had to get someone
to push Jun Seo...

136
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,570
when you all could alibi each other out.

137
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,570
But what are you?

138
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,279
A spectator who just watches,
whatever they do?

139
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,279
Is that what you are?

140
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,759
You're the investigator.

141
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,159
That's for you to find out.

142
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,370
There's a mill by the corner
of the construction site.

143
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,039
Under the eaves of that mill...

144
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,679
is a CCTV camera.

145
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,350
Did you know that?

146
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,750
No.

147
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,820
In the video...

148
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,460
taken from before 11:30 p.m.
until after 11:40 p.m.,

149
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,730
none of you, including you, were filmed.

150
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,769
If you'd taken a taxi
to Pilo-dong's main road...

151
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,070
and walked from there,

152
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,340
you wouldn't have been filmed
because you came from another direction.

153
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,409
But how did the others
manage to get into the site...

154
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,409
without being caught on camera?

155
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,009
I don't know how they came in.

156
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,179
But...

157
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,350
I'm sure they all came
through the alley by the mill.

158
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,759
What you told me
made things much clearer for me.

159
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,360
Someone in the group of people
that were there killed Jun Seo.

160
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,200
And that person thought...

161
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,899
they were caught
on the mill's security camera...

162
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,299
and killed the mill owner.

163
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,429
Would you like to kill time elsewhere?

164
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,600
No. I'll wait here.

165
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,899
Okay.

166
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
Hey.

167
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,360
Are you sure
the appointment was confirmed?

168
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Hello.

169
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,740
Where about is the mayor now?

170
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,809
Okay, thanks.

171
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
He's almost here.

172
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,720
Mr. Oh!

173
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,830
Call again.

174
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,429
Okay.

175
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,210
I am so very late. I apologize.

176
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
It's fine.

177
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,639
Please, take a seat.

178
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,090
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

179
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,049
Likewise.

180
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,960
You must be hungry. Let's eat first.

181
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,289
Serve the food.

182
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,490
Just a moment.

183
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,129
I'm sorry,

184
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,429
but I ate at my previous appointment.

185
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,769
I have another meeting right after,

186
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,169
so how about we have tea instead?

187
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,639
Sure.

188
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,379
You're a busy man,

189
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,750
so I'll get right to the point.

190
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,350
I asked to meet you today
because I might be able to...

191
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,490
get the chance to assist you.

192
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,690
- Is that so?
- You want to make...

193
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,759
Anhyun City a bioindustry complex.

194
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,230
I do.

195
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,269
Then you must sign a deal
with the major pharmaceutical companies,

196
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,539
and your term ends in four years.

197
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,570
You want and need...

198
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,570
visible results before the next election.

199
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I would.

200
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,509
Keumhyung will take the lead...

201
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,879
and build a bioindustry complex.

202
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,179
If this is a success, it could become...

203
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,620
a friendship that you could
benefit from in the future when you...

204
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,649
go on to bigger things.

205
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,759
You must know that...

206
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:44,799
Keumhyung Group's network
can assist you well.

207
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,029
Keumhyung Group's sales last year.
How much was it?

208
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,769
I know what you're trying to say, but...

209
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,110
After this meeting was scheduled,

210
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,879
I memorized some numbers.

211
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Your sales were 3.22 billion dollars.

212
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,950
A 9.2 percent drop from the year before.

213
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,019
Your business loss
was 62.2 million dollars.

214
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,350
That's a loss three years in a row.

215
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,120
I heard the banks have decided to
increase the interest rate...

216
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,230
on your existing loans
while refusing to loan you any more.

217
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,899
Hearing a company like that
wants to lead the way...

218
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,730
makes me anxious.

219
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,169
Yes.

220
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,210
I said I'd lead the way...

221
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,710
because Keumhyung Group
and Yigu Electronics' Vice-Chairman Han...

222
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:42,090
as well as many influential men
from Yeouido's financial district...

223
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:43,720
You are...

224
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,519
the third person
just this week to meet me...

225
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,429
with a plan to do this or that...

226
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,759
to improve Anhyun City.

227
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,070
They all claimed to have the backing
of powerful people.

228
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,340
I don't think...

229
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,639
I can do business with a man...

230
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,009
who dares to guarantee my future
as a politician when we just met.

231
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,009
It makes me too uneasy.

232
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,519
- Mr. Mayor. I meant...
- Please, excuse me.

233
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,990
Mr. Mayor.

234
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,759
I'm...

235
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:42,549
Lee Myung Guk.

236
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,649
He was your superior, right?

237
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,850
You'll have heard
his body was found recently.

238
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,190
Yes.

239
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,919
What did he do here?

240
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,100
He researched generic drugs mostly.

241
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,860
What did you think...

242
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,129
he was like as a person?

243
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,899
Was he in enough trouble
or under threat...

244
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,009
that he'd suddenly disappear...

245
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,169
and then show up dead?

246
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,009
How much do you know about Jun Seo?

247
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,649
What?

248
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,019
You were close friends 20 years ago,

249
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:23,549
but you have no idea
what he was thinking before he died.

250
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,659
That's why you're doing this.

251
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,460
Mr. Lee...

252
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,669
was nothing more or less
than a superior at work.

253
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,740
What kind of person someone's like
and what goes on around them?

254
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,309
You never know until they tell you.

255
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
So...

256
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,789
what will you do now?

257
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,359
I'll ask everyone...

258
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,200
why they didn't share
that they were at the scene.

259
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Why?

260
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,509
You don't want them to know you talked?

261
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,579
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

262
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,450
What I said today.

263
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,650
Do you believe it all?

264
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,519
No.

265
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,960
What about you?

266
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,730
Do you...

267
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,160
also think Jun Seo killed himself?

268
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,700
- No.
- Why not?

269
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,200
I saw it.

270
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,369
But...

271
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,579
at the time,

272
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,009
no one saw it.

273
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
His shoes.

274
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,490
He was wearing his shoes.

275
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,029
Jun Seo's shoes were found
on the ninth floor which was assumed...

276
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,670
to be where he jumped.

277
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,470
But the elevator on-site wasn't
on the ninth floor, but the first.

278
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:27,109
(Keumhyung)

279
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,619
- Mr. Oh.
- What?

280
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,690
Inside...

281
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,460
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
Chief Secretary Oh Chi Hyun)

282
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,970
What are you doing here?

283
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
I have a meeting pretty soon.

284
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,470
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
Chief Secretary Oh Chi Hyun)

285
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,539
Depending on the situation
you might have to miss it.

286
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,450
What's up?

287
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,490
If you so much as abduct or bribe...

288
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,390
Yoon Jin or anyone,

289
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,059
I'll come after you.

290
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,190
What will you do?

291
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,059
Find out for yourself.

292
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Hey.

293
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,069
Why are you two doing this to me?

294
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,869
It's true I went too far for fear...

295
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,809
Yoon Jin would cause a fuss,

296
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,210
and as a result, I failed.

297
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,009
She returned the money yesterday.

298
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,150
She'd spent quite a bit, though.

299
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:40,279
If you came to talk about that,
how about we not bother?

300
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,490
Do you mind?

301
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,049
You.

302
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,960
Why did you kill Jun Seo?

303
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,630
- What?
- February 23, at 11:30 p.m.

304
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,700
You must remember.

305
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,599
You were there.

306
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,440
Don't people kill themselves
in deserted places?

307
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,750
A construction site is a great place.

308
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,480
But why were you there?

309
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,950
If someone else was there,
it's no longer called a suicide.

310
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,990
Who said I was there?

311
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,089
You should ask
if I have proof you were there.

312
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,059
Why would you ask who told me?

313
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
What?

314
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,829
Did you suddenly think of someone...

315
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:32,269
who could testify you were there?

316
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,910
Why did you kill Park Jun Seo?

317
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,910
Jun Seo killed himself.

318
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,250
How so?

319
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,579
I went there
because Jun Seo told me to come.

320
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,119
I took the elevator up
because he seemed to be upstairs,

321
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,759
but he jumped.

322
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,730
Couldn't you have
gotten someone to push him?

323
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,630
- Did Jong Soo tell you to do it?
- Jang Jae Gyeong.

324
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,769
Is that loyalty or devotion?
Why are you so riled up?

325
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,130
Think about it.

326
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,599
Jun Seo knew something about Jong Soo,

327
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,869
and Jong Soo didn't like it.

328
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,609
And you're someone who does as he's told.

329
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,349
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Jeong Sang Eui. You were all together.

330
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,650
You refused to give up names.

331
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,190
You have some loyalty in you
from your high school days.

332
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,089
You're tight-lipped.

333
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,089
How did you get into the site,
and where did you exit from?

334
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,829
I parked by the road in Jungji-dong...

335
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,430
and walked in through an alley.

336
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,240
There was nowhere to park there.

337
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,940
Did you leave the same way?

338
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,710
Did you meet up with someone?

339
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,339
Jeong Sang Eui?

340
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,549
Did you know there was a camera?

341
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
No.

342
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,250
You're not surprised.
I thought it would be surprising.

343
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,289
I'll ask one more thing.

344
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,819
After Jun Seo landed,

345
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,059
who confirmed he was dead?

346
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,599
Does it matter who checked?

347
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,329
You should've checked,

348
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,269
even if you meant to kill him.

349
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,039
Tae Jin checked.

350
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,680
Was Jun Seo wearing shoes then?

351
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,710
I don't know.

352
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,579
It was dark, and I was stunned
by the fact that he'd fallen.

353
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,750
Didn't someone say his shoes
were found on the ninth floor?

354
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,599
Oh, yes. Right.

355
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,900
I'll let you get back to work.

356
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,299
Tell the others I came to talk to you.

357
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,670
Remember the questions I've asked
and tell them about it...

358
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,210
so you can come up with a story.

359
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,579
I'll be back if I find evidence.

360
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm glad you returned the cash
to Oh Chi Hyun.

361
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,990
Good for you.

362
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,859
Now let's stop digging into this case.

363
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,029
When I heard you'd been abducted,

364
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,230
my legs almost gave way.

365
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,630
I thought I'd lose my mind.

366
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,240
Let Jae Gyeong investigate...

367
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,170
and focus on your newspaper stuff.

368
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,970
I'd like you to do that.

369
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,109
And Woonjong Medical Center?

370
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,849
There must've been
a designated salesperson.

371
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,680
We hadn't been able to supply
Woonjong Medical Center.

372
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,119
Jun Seo got us in...

373
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,049
because he'd met the director
at a gathering.

374
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,829
That was why
Jun Seo went to so many events.

375
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,299
Put your health first.

376
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,099
You even order herbal tea
at cafes instead of coffee.

377
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,039
It's too dangerous. Quit it.

378
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:53,970
Did you hear me?

379
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:57,039
- What?
- Did you hear me?

380
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,539
Let's stop digging in this case.

381
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,210
- Yes, okay.
- Good.

382
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,779
Hey.

383
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,920
As an insurance salesman,
is there a company you want to sign with?

384
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,420
A place you tried to get into
many times but failed.

385
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,789
- Manbae Electronics.
- Manbae Electronics?

386
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,200
Let's say I know
their Head of General Affairs very well.

387
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,930
So I pull some strings and get you in...

388
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,140
so you can sell policies to their staff.

389
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
Can you really do that?

390
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,369
No, I meant hypothetically.

391
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,609
Oh, okay.

392
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,440
Then would you give me business cards...

393
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,549
and let me sell policies for you?

394
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,880
- No.
- No, right?

395
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,980
You'd sell them yourself
or get your minion to do it, right?

396
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,450
- Right.
- Yes.

397
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,190
Exactly.

398
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,319
Jun Seo was an estate agent.

399
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,859
Even if he helped them
supply to Woonjong Medical Center,

400
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,099
does it make sense
he had a business card...

401
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,599
and delivered them himself too?

402
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,200
He did what?

403
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,170
Hey.

404
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,440
This is weird, right?

405
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,839
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical,
Park Jun Seo)

406
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,279
But what's weirder is that...

407
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,849
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical made
some bad medicine.

408
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:12,019
Why would Jun Seo go around apologizing
and keeping people's mouths shut?

409
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,980
Was that Jun Seo's fault?

410
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,349
He wasn't even an employee there.

411
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,019
Says who?

412
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,559
Oh Chi Hyun.

413
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,359
Hey.

414
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,930
You said Hyun Woo saw me get abducted
and told you, right?

415
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,430
Yes.

416
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,970
Okay, then I should meet with him first.

417
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,700
- Yoon Jin.
- Why?

418
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,670
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

419
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,509
What?

420
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,640
Hey, we should stop
looking into this case.

421
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,380
If you keep chasing this story,
you might really get into big trouble...

422
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,579
and get badly hurt.

423
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:44,309
Then what use would
all that insurance money be?

424
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,319
Hey, Joo Song.

425
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,390
Fine.

426
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,190
Thank you for saying that
out of concern for me.

427
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:55,029
But am I doing this
so that I can live well by myself?

428
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,289
I know, but...

429
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,859
Wanting to live with my own daughter.

430
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,700
Is that such a greedy thing to want?

431
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,200
Have you ever had your child
taken away right before your eyes...

432
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,900
in a divorce just because
you didn't make as much money?

433
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,779
Hey, that ex-husband of yours
isn't even making a living or anything.

434
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,809
Then, doesn't that mean
you can bring Ye Eun?

435
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,380
Am I any different?

436
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,779
At least he has some money saved up.

437
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,049
I really don't have anything.

438
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:24,890
I'm penniless.

439
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,660
If I bring Ye Eun here in my situation,

440
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,029
how can I be sure that I can raise her
better than in Canada?

441
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,200
I'm just saying it's dangerous.

442
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,829
Hey, don't worry.

443
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,269
I've been a reporter for 15 years.

444
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,210
Do you think my path has
always been flowery all that time?

445
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm off to school.

446
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,009
All right.

447
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,200
I was coming outside
from grocery shopping,

448
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:09,299
and Jang Jae Gyeong,
Heo Joo Song, and Oh Yoon Jin...

449
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,470
came out of that alley.

450
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:13,200
There aren't that many houses up there.

451
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Isn't it strange?

452
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,170
Who are you?

453
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,710
What?

454
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,920
Oh, are you...

455
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,720
a friend of Mr. Park Jun Seo's?

456
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,890
Oh...

457
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,529
- Yes.
- I see.

458
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,130
I heard that Mr. Park passed away.

459
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,170
Yes, that's right.

460
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,470
But how...

461
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,809
How did you know Jun Seo?

462
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,980
He came by often.

463
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,279
Oh, by any chance,

464
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,220
are there any surviving relatives
of Mr. Park's?

465
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,819
I wasn't able to go to the funeral.

466
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,160
He has a wife.

467
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,359
Is that so?

468
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,190
So...

469
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,630
Oh, right.

470
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,559
Please wait just a little.

471
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,930
Oh, my.

472
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,259
Oh, well...

473
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm sorry, but... Here.

474
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,730
Couldn't you give it to her for me?

475
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,440
Gosh, please do that for me.

476
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,240
(Min Hyun Woo)

477
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,319
The market is really struggling right now,

478
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,789
the value of our collateral
has gone down a lot.

479
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,519
So?

480
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,690
Well...

481
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,690
This may be a bit out of line,

482
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,200
but if you could make
a gesture to indicate...

483
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,160
that you'd pay out of pocket,

484
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,329
it'd be a good reason for me
to have a positive discussion...

485
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,369
when I meet with the bank's president.

486
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:34,039
My personal funds?

487
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,569
We only say this to mean
that the symbolism is what's important.

488
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,509
Even if the amount you announce is
different from what you actually pay,

489
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,839
it doesn't matter.

490
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,309
You know that, don't you?

491
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,680
So, without the use of my personal funds,

492
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,650
we can't get any extra loans?

493
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:49,819
Well...

494
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,109
Have you not heard from CEO Won yet?

495
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,779
He's in front of me right now, sir.

496
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Send him in.

497
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,019
What happened with your meeting
with Mayor Joo?

498
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,059
(Keumhyung Group)

499
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,329
Mayor Joo...

500
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,740
seems anxious
about our financial situation.

501
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,369
So, I plan on meeting with
the Vice President of Yigu Electronics...

502
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,880
and asking him to hurry along
with the confirmations of funding plans.

503
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,150
I saw the Vice President of Wonjin Bank
leaving just now.

504
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,019
What did the bank say?

505
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,789
Unless we get approval to do business
from Anhyun,

506
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,859
there's no possibility until then.

507
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,190
Do you think Chairman Han of Yigu
will make an investment?

508
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,329
Yes, I'll make him do so.

509
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,500
Don't worry, sir.

510
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,170
Twenty years ago,

511
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,609
as we turned 3.9 million square meters...

512
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:18,240
of land filled with pigsties
into Anhyun City,

513
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,710
the Keumhyung of today came to be.

514
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,079
This Pilo-dong project...

515
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,579
It may be our last chance
to get back on our feet.

516
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,789
If we fail at this, I as well as you...

517
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:36,859
might be dragged around
by creditors for our whole lives.

518
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:38,859
Yes, sir.

519
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,240
(Narcotics Unit)

520
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,359
Detective Park.

521
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,589
Did you perhaps get all the CCTV footage
from near the mill?

522
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,259
- Yes, sir.
- Then, was there a taxi...

523
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,829
among the cars that left the alley
around the time of the incident?

524
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:18,500
There weren't any identifiable taxis
that left the alley.

525
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,640
You have the videos, don't you?

526
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:20,769
Captain Jang.

527
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,009
Last time, I told you...

528
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,539
there wasn't anything worth noting
from the CCTV footage...

529
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:25,579
from near the construction site.

530
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:28,279
But you went to the scene,
and the mill owner got murdered.

531
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:32,180
I also think this case has
a connection to the prior ones.

532
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:33,980
I agree with what you think.

533
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
However,

534
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:38,190
I report to Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan.

535
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,720
And Inspector Yoo thinks otherwise.

536
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:44,559
You know why I'm telling you this,
don't you?

537
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,460
Yes, I understand.

538
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Captain.

539
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,069
Come to the lounge in a little bit.

540
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,949
- Do you want to watch this with me?
- What is it?

541
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,349
The CCTV footage from around the time
the murder case happened at the mill.

542
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:12,619
How did you get that?

543
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,059
Didn't Yoo Kyung Hwan make a fuss?

544
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,230
What time did the murder happen again?

545
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,210
It was between 5:12 p.m. and 5:15 p.m.

546
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,909
What are we looking for right now?

547
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,210
A taxi.

548
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,079
A taxi?

549
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,079
There was a resident who saw a taxi
on the day of the incident.

550
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,019
Circumstances point to the taxi driver
and the guest being accomplices,

551
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,420
or there is a high likelihood
that the taxi driver is the culprit.

552
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,900
If he came from that alley
and took a right turn,

553
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,199
we would've seen the car...

554
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,369
going past the crosswalk
and heading toward Hwansung.

555
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,170
But since we don't see it,

556
00:34:58,769 --> 00:34:59,940
maybe it took a turn left?

557
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,309
Gosh.

558
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,070
Where is this?

559
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,039
It's the security camera
at the next intersection.

560
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,980
If they turned left earlier,
they should be on this camera.

561
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:10,349
I see.

562
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,380
We should look into all the taxis here.

563
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,219
It seems the Violent Crimes Division
looked into most of them.

564
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:19,420
I guess they use their brains too,
seeing as how they focused on the taxi.

565
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,889
I told them to.

566
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,630
Was there anyone suspicious?

567
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,199
Not yet.

568
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,400
Was there another escape route?

569
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,369
It would've been hard to walk out.

570
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,070
Yes. The sun was still out,

571
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,440
and with the blood on their clothes,
it would've been difficult.

572
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,550
- Soo Hyun.
- Yes?

573
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,019
Get all of the videos from Captain Jang,

574
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,449
recheck all of the taxi numbers,
and make a table of them.

575
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:52,489
They're the taxis that were in service
around the time of the murder at the mill.

576
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,719
Look into the criminal records
of the drivers as well.

577
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:55,989
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,059
If the culprit had really been
a taxi driver,

579
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,260
they would've tried to wipe the blood
from the hands or clothes...

580
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,000
as soon as possible.

581
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,469
So look into places...

582
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,570
they could've pulled over
to wipe their hands.

583
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,969
Look into the security cameras
in the area as well.

584
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,139
Yes, ma'am.

585
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,019
It belongs to us,
the people who know the passcode.

586
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,030
Give me a little more time.

587
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,230
It's not an easy decision for me either.

588
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
How about this?

589
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,400
If they bring me ten million dollars...

590
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,570
and lower their head to beg me,
I'll think about it.

591

but they didn't tell me anything new.

CEO Yoon is selling a new drug,

and the information stops there.

- Okay.
- Captain.

602

603
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,289
Should I try getting some of that?

Why would I pay back money for the beef?

669
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:52,780

for the emotional distress he caused...

00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:56,650

Did you go there on an errand

So, we had gotten a large prescription
for the painkillers she used to take.

718
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,170
The medication we supplied
to Woonjong Medical Center.

719
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,010
How did you know
there was a problem with it?

720
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,710
Did you talk to them?

721
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,679
They hung up without saying anything.

722
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,750
And the phone has been turned off
ever since.

723
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,179
That was why I went
all the way to Pilo-dong.

724
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,190
Just in case.

725
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,889
The number 2-3-0-9-1-0 on top,
is that a date?

726
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:48,320
Yes. They don't give us
the customers' names,

727
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,860
so I save the numbers
with the delivery items and dates.

728
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,190
Hey, this date...

729
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,800
That was the day Ms. Park Bok Rye
got the wrong prescription drugs.

730
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,800
(Woonjong Medical Center's
medication error on Park Bok Rye)

731
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,269
But Jun Seo wasn't thoughtless enough...

732
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:04,340
to make a high school kid like you
deliver narcotic painkillers.

733
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,880
Did something perhaps happen
to Jun Seo that day?

734
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,679
His daughter was very sick.

735
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,349
It was a delivery he was supposed to do.

736
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,389
Is Yoon Hee still not doing well?

737
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:17,389
But he asked me to do it.

738
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,519
Did Park Jun Seo ever make you
deliver drugs after that?

739
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:24,059
No.

740
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,489
Just because he asked you
to do him a favor,

741
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,400
he paid for your school tuition
and opened up an office here?

742
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,860
I don't think Jun Seo would've done that.

743
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,539
What did you do with the drugs?

744
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,940
What drugs?

745
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,110
The drugs I told you to take
to Lorraine Hotel first.

746
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,710
Where did you sneak them off to?

747
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,579
- I didn't sneak them off anywhere.
- Tell me.

748
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,780
It's not too late. Tell me now.

749
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,949
I don't know. I delivered them all,
just like you told me to.

750
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,619
You didn't come
straight from the hospital.

751
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,449
Where did you stop by?

752
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:51,949
I know everything. Hurry up and say it.

753
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,460
Who did you sell them to?
Hurry up and tell me!

754
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,130
I really don't know!

755
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
This is your last chance.

756
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,599
Hurry up and say it.

757
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,469
Who did you sell them to?

758
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,000
Where are those drugs now?

759
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,139
- Hurry up and say it.
- Hyun Woo!

760
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,510
No.

761
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,139
What are you doing?

762
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,610
- Hyun Woo.
- Go back inside.

763
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
Oh, my.

764
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,050
Are you okay?

765
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,420
Goodness.

766
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,190
Oh, my dear Hyun Woo.

767
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,190
Hello?

768
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,489
Mr. Park, I heard you called.

769
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,659
- It's okay.
- We got the eight boxes of pills safely.

770
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:41,539
Do you still have those pills now?

771
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:45,139
You didn't prescribe them
to anyone, right?

772
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,550
What? I already prescribed them all.

773
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,880
Why?

774
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,019
I'll be right there.

775
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:31,519
You're here.

776
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
Did you apply some ointment?

777
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,340
How old are you?

778
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,739
Leave now
if you're done paying for the damages.

779
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,110
Your name is Hyun Woo, right?

780
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,119
I'm sorry.

781
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,949
I'm an adult,
but I didn't even look into things.

782
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,159
Sorry.

783
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,429
Forgive me.

784
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,800
That was the first time
an adult asked me...

785
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,139
to forgive him.

786
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,880
Did Jun Seo keep coming by after that?

787
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,409
No.

788
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,579
I went to see him.

789
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,949
He said I shouldn't become close to him,

790
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:39,119
but there are times
when you need an adult.

791
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:42,860
I went to him at times like those.

792
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,659
Then, do you know what happened
with the bad pills...

793
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:50,199
out of the ones that got delivered
to Woonjong Medical Center?

794
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,769
He never told me anything specific,

795
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,570
but I think the pills that I delivered to
Lorraine Hotel...

796
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,940
got switched with some other pills.

797
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,150
I slipped on the road because of the rain,
and the pills got mixed up.

798
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,079
And I think...

799
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,889
I put Mr. Park in
an awkward spot afterward.

800
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:12,619
So, the pills that should've gone to
Lorraine Hotel...

801
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,760
went to Ms. Park Bok Rye.

802
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,329
Do you know why...

803
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,329
Mr. Park committed suicide?

804
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,570
Do you think it was because...

805
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,639
his daughter died before he did?

806
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:31,869
I'm not sure.

807
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,010
Do you think he was nice to me...

808
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,750
because he pitied me?

809
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,420
I'm sure that's not it.

810
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,889
Jun Seo was very lonely.

811
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,159
But he probably thought of you
as a friend.

812
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,130
I'm sure that's why.

813
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,659
Here.

814
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,869
What are these?

815
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:58,929
There you go.

816
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:00,969
They're Lee Myung Guk's work logs.

817
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,010
Read them over in detail by tomorrow
evening and come over to my place.

818
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:05,239
What's this?

819
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:08,639
Are we forming some sort of
investigative team headquarters?

820
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,980
Okay. See you tomorrow.

821
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,519
Give me a lift down the hill.

822
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,650
Oh, okay.

823
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,820
My car is over there.

824
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,119
I'll give you a ride.

825
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,230
Well, I have something to tell you
on the way down too.

826
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,030
Okay, then.

827
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,159
I'll go with him.

828
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,929
Okay, get home safely.

829
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,570
What?

830
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,300
Bye.

831
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,469
Okay, bye.

832
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:44,679
- Hey, that was smooth.
- What was?

833
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,650
You're taking me
to Youngryun Cold Storage, right?

834

Yes.

839

No way.

You don't mean you want me to
act like a druggie, do you?

841

What can I help you with?

842
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,559
Oh, yes. Well, I...

843
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:40,170
I'd like to take
some appetite suppressants.

844
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,039
Could I get a prescription?

845
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,150

Hello, I'm Oh Yoon Jin
from the Anhyun Economic Daily.

860

What brings you here?

861
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,929
What do you do here?

This is a freezer storage unit.

if I have the authority to do that.

Besides,

866
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,300
aren't you supposed to bring
a warrant or whatever...

867

Yes, you're right, sir.

to see what's being stored inside.

Sir.

- Yes.

00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,349
from taking the drugs
that were meant for Jong Soo,

897
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:48,989
that would be such a huge story.

898
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,360
Hey, where are you going?

899
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,059
Hey!

900
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,960

(Youngryun Cold Storage,

903
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,510
This is security camera footage
around the time of the murder at the mill.

904
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,210
What's going on?

905
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,780
Hey.

906
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,380

907

(Pilo-dong construction)

911
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:28,630
What is it?

912
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,769
What is it?

913
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:33,599
(Pilo-dong construction)

914
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,800
Where is he going now?

915
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:38,469
(Redevelopment area, entry prohibited)

916
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:47,349
(Mill)

917
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:48,820
- Hello?
- Captain.

918
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,320
I took a look at the reports filed
around the mill on the day of the murder.

919
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,460
Someone reported seeing a driver...

920
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,730
wiping blood off their hands
at a public restroom...

921
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,260
after parking the taxi
at Jungjidong Citizens Park...

922
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,829
immediately after the incident.

923
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,670
(Who is the Pilo-dong
development plan for?)

924
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:05,969
But the person who made the report...

925
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:07,869
was the parent of the elementary schooler
who saw the driver.

926
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,010
Since they didn't see it themselves
and the kid wasn't harmed,

927
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,039
the local officers just ignored it.

928
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:17,710
(We press our own oils.)

929
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,719
This security camera
only shows the crosswalk.

930
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:34,429
- Did you see that?
- See what? What did I miss?

931
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:35,960
This man here.

932
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,030
This man who was about to cross
this crosswalk at 5:15 p.m.

933
00:56:40,469 --> 00:56:41,900
He's avoiding something
while crossing the street.

934
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,610
Yes.

935
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:45,340
A car.

936
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,579
The car passed the alley with the mill,
came out to the big road,

937
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,650
and went straight.

938
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:01,119
Not left or right, but straight.

939
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,260
So where does the alley
this car entered connect to?

940
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,860
It's connected to the road...

941
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,960
in front of an old cold storage place
called Youngryun Cold Storage.

942
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,099
And they had to have driven
the opposite way on the one-way street.

943
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:13,070
If they had gone straight from there,
they would've reached the big road again.

944
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,440
If they had gone that way,

945
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,099
they would've been
on another security camera.

946
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:21,940
(One-way street, For sale,
Youngryun Cold Storage)

947
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,880
But there was a small road next to it.

948
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,949
At first, I wasn't sure
whether it could fit a car.

949
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:30,349
But I saw tire marks.

950
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,550
(One-way street, for sale,
Youngryun Cold Storage)

951
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,659
It was wide enough
for a car to pass through.

952
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:43,159
It was about 700m long.

953
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:49,400
(One-way street, for sale,
Youngryun Cold Storage, about 700m)

954
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,670
And the end of that road...

955
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,369
connects to a big road that splits
into Jungji-dong and Join-dong.

956
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:58,949
(Join-dong, Jungji-dong)

957
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,619
(Jungji-dong three-way intersection)

958
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,260
Is that the security camera footage
we just received?

959
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:10,260
It's from the block
behind the one we had last time.

960
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:13,960
We couldn't check it
because it was quite far.

961
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:18,070
That alleyway connects to this place.

962
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:22,469
(Jungji-dong three-way intersection)

963
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:27,280
A taxi.

964
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:34,639
It's 3-4-A-5-2-5-3.

965
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,280
It's a private taxi.

966
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,510
Yes, please look up
the taxi owner quickly.

967
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,079
Yes.

968
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,059
You.

969
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:56,760
Who are you?

970
01:00:04,139 --> 01:00:06,510
(Connection)

971
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,809
(Connection)

972
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,420
Are you getting revenge
for getting kicked out of college?

973
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,420
Si Jung.

974
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,449
You're doing well.

975
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:51,119
Don't take more than two pills.

976
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:55,420
What if they're trying to use you
to catch Won Jong Soo?

977
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,630
We need to show them
we're the next owners of the company.

978
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,800
They were indirectly asking me
whether you had ordered that.

979
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,300
If we get connected to the incident,
it's all over, Tae Jin.

980
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,300
I'm confident, Chairman Won.

981
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:06,570
You're crossing the line.

982
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,670
Aren't we in the same boat now?

983
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,039
If Park Tae Jin keeps feeling rushed,

984
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,670
there's a possibility
that she might reveal everything today.

985
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,880
He's going to make Choi Ji Yeon
tell him the password no matter what.

986
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,809
I said I would only do this
until we got 500,000 dollars.

987
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:20,349
- Jun Seo.
- Didn't you kill Jun Seo...

988
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:21,550
because of this?

989
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,889
Are you sure
we weren't caught on camera there?

990
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:24,989
This is in front of my house.

991
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:26,349
Jae Gyeong already knew.

992
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,860
I think it's basically mine.

993
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,730
The insurance payout belongs
to whoever received it.

994
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,260
- What did you say?
- Who are you...

995
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,059
calling shameless right now?

996
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,539
