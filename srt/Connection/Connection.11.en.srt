00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,489
(Call history: Gong Jin Wook)

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,730
(Gong Jin Wook)

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,670
Hello?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Doctor, it's me.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,710
What is it?

7
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,770
Well...

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,270
Today,

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,509
I killed CEO Yoon.

10
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,109
What?

11
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:43,079
So for a while,<br>you won't be able to sell in Korea.

12
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,250
I doubt you can find someone else.

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,090
For a while,

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,119
no one will be willing to sell.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,630
I'll go to China.<br>I have connections there.

16
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:56,929
So...

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,259
Keep supplying me.

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
In return...

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,140
I need you to get me on a boat to China.

20
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,040
Mr. Gong.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,540
I'm not asking for a free ride.

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,879
I'll send you two items<br>via subway courier very soon.

23
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm sending them believing<br>they'll be of some value to you.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,980
That's...

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,250
all I have right now.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,569
Put the items in the back seat.

27
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,209
The money's in the envelope.

28
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,409
Okay.

29
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,349
This much?

30
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:48,270
(Connection)

31
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,939
(Episode 11)

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,389
They didn't get access to the account?

33
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,990
It looked like it.

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,800
Will Tae Jin be okay?

35
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,270
I don't know<br>where I got the guts to do that.

36
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,770
Yoon Jin was in so much danger.

37
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,370
How did she figure out the password?

38
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,509
At your place, when Ji Yeon<br>was throwing up in your toilet.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,349
Yoon Jin got into Ji Yeon's phone.

40
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,120
That's why as soon as<br>Ji Yeon left my place,

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,849
she met with Tae Jin...

42
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,250
and asked him about Jun Seo and Yoon Jin?

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,860
She must be in all sorts of shock.

44
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,189
What did the doctor say?

45
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,430
She might be like that for a while<br>and we should watch her.

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,270
Does she need to be admitted?

47
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,469
No.

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,629
Oh Yoon Jin!

49
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,539
Die!

50
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,789
Don't you think you should see a doctor?

51
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,389
This CCTV video.

52
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,430
Delete it.

53
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,300
What?

54
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,800
Delete everything.

55
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,199
Delete it?

56
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,600
Okay, sure.

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,110
Two, three.

58
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,149
Four.

59
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,350
Eight.

60
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,170
Open up.

61
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,410
Chew.

62
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,339
Does it taste okay?

63
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,850
Good for you.

64
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,819
Here. Open wide.

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,990
It's okay.

66
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,230
It was too big.

67
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,259
You can't open your mouth wide.

68
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,269
I should give you very little.

69
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,540
You're doing this<br>because you're embarrassed,

70
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,310
but I have lots of questions,<br>so let's quit.

71
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,680
If you don't stand at the count of three,

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,810
I'll pull out your chair.

73
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,319
One, two...

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,949
What is it?

75
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you need to pee?

76
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,990
Shall we go to the toilet?

77
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,589
What?

78
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,899
- Joo Song.<br>- Yes?

79
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,230
Next time,

80
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,470
add some kkakdugi sauce to my soup.

81
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,339
You kept feeding me bland broth...

82
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,980
and plain rice with nothing else.

83
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,610
Are you okay, Yoon Jin?

84
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,980
Can't you tell?

85
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,050
I only slightly sprained my neck.

86
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,720
Hey, was that an act? Darn you!

87
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,420
I was so worried about you!

88
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,459
I was embarrassed.

89
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,759
That's why.

90
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,500
- Sorry.<br>- Joo Song told me everything else.

91
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,430
What's the password for?

92
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,170
It can't be for a bank account.

93
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,269
It seemed to be<br>some kind of cryptocurrency.

94
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,639
Was it Thailand?

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Did you check the site?

96
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,110
Yes.

97
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,680
They were weirdly funny.

98
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,519
The password is eight digits.

99
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,850
Tae Jin chose the first four,

100
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,860
and Jun Seo chose the last four.

101
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,459
They clearly didn't trust each other.

102
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,829
Does that mean<br>Tae Jin didn't kill Jun Seo?

103
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,660
He wouldn't have been so rash...

104
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,000
if he didn't have the password.

105
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,740
Tae Jin would've thought<br>he could get the code from Ji Yeon.

106
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,839
But what now?

107
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,810
There are zero clues<br>as to what the password is.

108
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,110
They only have one try left.

109
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,279
That money.

110
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,189
It's possible Jun Seo and Tae Jin<br>made it from selling drugs.

111
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,689
Were you going to...

112
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,660
make a deal with Tae Jin knowing that?

113
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,829
I know, right?

114
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,129
I'm remorseful, okay?

115
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,230
I'll let you scold me,

116
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,699
but will you let me at least finish...

117
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,269
my food?

118
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,850
Thanks. I was starving.

119
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,680
Someone called "Doctor" appears...

120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,579
in the Lemon Mulberry investigation.

121
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,180
The manufacturer.

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,120
Do you remember Lee Myung Guk's logs?

123
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,720
He met Jeong Sang Eui<br>regularly at a lab...

124
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,759
in Pilo-dong and did something.

125
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,660
What they made then...

126
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,529
was Lemon Mulberry?

127
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,600
At first, they'll have made<br>small batches just for Jong Soo.

128
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Then...

129
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,540
Lee Myung Guk manufactured it,<br>Jun Seo delivered it,

130
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,370
and Jong Soo took it?

131
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,910
I can follow that far.

132
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,980
But...

133
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,009
where does Tae Jin come in<br>when he's not in this picture?

134
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,019
Manufactures, delivers, and takes.

135
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,049
It's a simple picture<br>and Tae Jin's not in it.

136
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,019
Jun Seo was the courier.

137
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,559
Why did he switch roles<br>and start a drug business with Tae Jin?

138
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,929
Hey, that's sharp.

139
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,159
Thanks.

140
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,799
Because of who and what he is,

141
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,429
Tae Jin would've planned it<br>so he was never at the forefront.

142
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,399
He'd have used Jun Seo.

143
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,440
And Jun Seo who felt uneasy about it...

144
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,409
would've thought<br>he should have at least...

145
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,179
the last four digits of the code<br>to keep Tae Jin in check.

146
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,850
What about now that Jun Seo is dead?

147
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,919
Without Jun Seo,

148
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,549
who's delivering Jong Soo's supply,

149
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,490
and who's running<br>the Lemon Mulberry business...

150
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,490
Tae Jin used to?

151
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,950
Hey.

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,659
(Xinopharm)

153
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,330
Good job.

154
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
Thanks.

155
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,220
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

156
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,269
What brings you here at this hour?

157
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,940
I had something to ask you.

158
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,279
I met Oh Yoon Jin last night.

159
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,480
Why do you think...

160
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,519
I met with her?

161
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
I'm not sure.

162
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,120
Did you know?

163
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,590
Yoon Jin also knew...

164
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,559
the password.

165
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:39,669
Was it right?

166
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:41,809
Was it...

167
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,610
really the password?

168
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,769
Tae Jin.

169
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Tae Jin!

170
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:59,120
(Jeong Sang Eui)

171
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,690
- What is it?<br>- Can you talk right now?

172
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,389
Go ahead. What is it?

173
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,230
Well, something big happened...

174
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,799
- Something big?<br>- Yes.

175
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,470
CEO Yoon, the person<br>who Gong Jin Wook did business with...

176
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,529
You idiot!

177
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,799
Don't you ever listen to what I say?

178
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,610
I told you not to talk about<br>this stuff over the phone, didn't I?

179
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,039
Oh, right. Sorry.

180
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,809
Sang Eui.

181
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,419
How much longer will you act<br>like such a dumb fool?

182
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,419
Hey, I'm sorry. It was so urgent that I...

183
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,659
Hey, then where should we meet?<br>Should I come to you?

184
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,529
Tomorrow at 4 p.m.<br>Come to Myeongeul Garden.

185
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,570
You remember<br>the place we had dinner last time?

186
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,440
Oh, okay.

187
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,250
(Tuesday, March 7)

188
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,590
(Yigu Group Han Sung Hoon)

189
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,929
Hey, how did it go?

190
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,330
For real?

191
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,669
Okay, got it. Good work.

192
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,919
What was it?

193
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,789
Did the board approve?

194
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,259
Yigu Group...

195
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,570
is giving us 500 million dollars.

196
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,769
You scared me.

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,100
We're all set, you punk!

198
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,039
We're set.

199
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,809
Now, as soon as Mayor Joo In Sang<br>signs off on it,

200
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,750
this will all be ours, Chi Hyun.

201
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Of course.

202
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,220
I'm sure Joo In Sang won't have<br>any reasons to oppose this.

203
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:19,419
Good work.

204
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,159
Seriously.

205
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,759
Gosh!

206
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
(Prosecution Service)

207
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,340
Is that so?

208
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:34,909
That's good news.

209
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,980
Congratulations.

210
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,779
Of course, I should be there too.

211
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,250
See you later.

212
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Bye.

213
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:09,440
Have a seat.

214
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,110
What brings you all the way here?<br>You didn't even call.

215
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,250
I thought you wouldn't show up<br>if you were called in as a testifier.

216
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,120
What?

217
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,190
That's your number, right?

218
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,399
So?

219
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,230
This is a list of calls<br>Jeong Yoon Ho made...

220
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,169
from a payphone the night before last.

221
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,570
Why do you think Yoon Ho called you?

222
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,639
What do you think?

223
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,169
Park Tae Jin.

224
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,009
I'm asking because I'm curious too.

225
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,610
A friend from high school<br>who's wanted for murder...

226
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,250
called in the middle of the night<br>from a payphone.

227
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,820
What do you think we talked about?

228
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
It's obvious.

229
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,789
"On what grounds was I named<br>a murder suspect?"

230
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,330
"Couldn't you help me out somehow?"

231
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,159
So?

232
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,329
I told him to turn himself in.

233
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,559
Don't you think<br>you would've done the same?

234
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,599
Let me know right away<br>if Yoon Ho calls you again.

235
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,869
Don't make me find out first<br>and come looking for you.

236
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,440
- All right.<br>- Also,

237
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,380
what happened last night?

238
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,910
You nearly killed Yoon Jin.

239
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,650
You already deleted the CCTV footage<br>from the Internet cafe.

240
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,720
Did you kill Jun Seo?

241
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,099
I'm a prosecutor.

242
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,500
This kind of shock method...

243
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,869
might work on guys like<br>Jeong Sang Eui or Oh Chi Hyun.

244
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,309
But you must know<br>that it doesn't work for me.

245
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,210
You heard...

246
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,509
that we were there that night.

247
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,880
You must be confused.

248
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,190
You must be so sure that one of us<br>did that to Jun Seo,

249
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,630
but Jun Seo had to fall<br>when we were all inside the elevator.

250
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:12,000
You can't prove a direct murder, right?

251
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,869
You must've had to<br>use your brain a bit for this one.

252
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,069
But it's too bad...

253
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,339
that Jun Seo left without telling you<br>the password.

254
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,240
Judging by the scale<br>of the Lemon Mulberry business,

255
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,210
it must be worth<br>at least ten million dollars.

256
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:33,420
It must be such a waste.

257
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
Right?

258
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,019
Are you the Doctor?

259
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,059
Did you drag me into this?

260
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,829
"Drag you in?"

261
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:55,509
I have no idea what you're talking about.

262
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,440
Lemon Mulberry and what? The Doctor?

263
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,240
What is all that about?

264
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,650
That's right.

265
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,849
You'd have to say that you don't know.

266
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,319
I might be recording our conversation<br>right now.

267
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,089
I'm warning you.

268
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,289
Judging by my gut feeling,

269
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,660
I think I'm nearly there.

270
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,630
I think I could catch you<br>if I just reach my hand out.

271
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,970
From now on,<br>when you make your next move,

272
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,009
be extra careful.

273
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,380
At this rate,

274
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,579
you'll get caught by me.

275
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,269
(Chairman, Won Chang Ho)

276
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,269
Come in.

277
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,769
(Keumhyung Group)

278
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Have you heard?

279
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,609
It's 500 million dollars.

280
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,349
I was hoping for 200 or 300 million...

281
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,180
at the most.

282
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,750
Doesn't 500 million dollars mean...

283
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,920
Yigu Group believes in this project?

284
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,289
I just spoke to Chairman Han on the phone.

285
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,059
He has high hopes for this project.<br>He looks forward to it.

286
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
I see.

287
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,569
We only need the business approval<br>from the city now.

288
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,569
When are you seeing Mayor Joo?

289
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,240
We're meeting for lunch tomorrow.

290
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,470
The situation is different<br>from the last time,

291
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,609
so I'll make sure to bring good news.

292
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,109
As you should.

293
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
What is it?

294
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,519
How are things between you<br>and Tae Jin these days?

295
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,019
Good. Why do you ask?

296
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,759
Tae Jin told me...

297
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,430
he'd like to join...

298
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,299
the Pilo-dong project as an investor.

299
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Pardon?

300
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,670
Oh, that?

301
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,839
He mentioned it briefly before.

302
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,240
He must know a few people<br>who have money around him.

303
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,680
He must be talking about them.

304
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,710
I already checked.

305
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,920
How much longer will you rely on Tae Jin?

306
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,660
You should've figured this out already<br>and have it sorted out.

307
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,400
I told him not to get any ideas<br>and to remain a prosecutor,

308
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,730
but he already had his head in the clouds.

309
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,140
Act oblivious for a while.

310
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,109
Just quietly put a man on him.

311
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,980
Okay.

312
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,150
Should I give you two some privacy?

313
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,950
Yes. Thank you.

314
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,549
(Fragrant Express,<br>Number 1 in customer satisfaction!)

315
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,519
Did you capture all of them?

316
00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,359
Yes, all thanks to you.

317
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,160
Unfortunately,<br>except for the main culprit,

318
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,460
we caught everyone else.

319
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,859
I see.

320
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:09,769
Okay.

321
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,670
If you have something to say,<br>please go ahead.

322
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:19,509
Have you ever smuggled anyone out?

323
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Yes, when I was young.

324
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,109
- To where?<br>- China.

325
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,579
You have the contacts<br>of other smugglers, right?

326
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,549
We lost contact a long time ago.

327
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,849
It was ages ago.

328
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm sure you can easily find out<br>if you ask someone.

329
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:31,789
Hey.

330
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,390
Even if in this line of work,

331
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,329
people change jobs often.

332
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,160
The guys I used to know...

333
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,869
are either behind bars or dead now.

334
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,430
Just look into it.

335
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,809
One should live a clean life<br>from the beginning.

336
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,750
It's so hard...

337
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:00,779
when you try to switch over.

338
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,349
That's exactly my point.

339
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,200
You scare me.

340
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,470
- Young Eun.<br>- Mom!

341
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,769
How did you manage to come?

342
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,309
I thought the police wouldn't let you out.

343
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,940
I sneaked out.

344
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,779
I went to see Dad.

345
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Mom!

346
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,750
He's well.

347
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,019
What if they catch you on your way back?

348
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:35,720
I waited for you<br>so we could go in together.

349
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,490
It'll be okay<br>if I go back with my daughter.

350
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,329
Is anyone there?

351
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
No.

352
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,200
Great. Let's go.

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,099
What should we have for dinner?

354
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,799
I don't know.

355
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,099
Ms. Kang Si Jung.

356
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:56,609
Where have you been?

357
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:58,980
I went to meet my daughter.

358
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,039
Can't you tell?

359
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:05,319
We'll have to take you in.

360
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,220
Thanks for your hard work today.

361
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,289
Hey, you have no excuse to be tired.

362
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:17,089
Of course, I'm tired.<br>I worked hard to earn money today.

363
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,509
I can't understand it either.

364
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,680
I don't know why he used my birthdate<br>as the password.

365
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:41,319
We only dated briefly in high school...

366
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,420
You can barely call that dating<br>these days.

367
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,859
If I had been in your position,

368
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,029
I would've felt offended too.

369
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,170
I understand, but...

370
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,900
You're right. I was offended.

371
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:03,539
But I thought about it<br>upon returning home,

372
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,039
and they were all excuses I had made up<br>for myself.

373
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:12,380
To be honest,<br>the seven years of our married life...

374
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,349
Our dear Yoon Hee...

375
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:18,559
was sick ever since she was born,

376
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:21,319
but we were happy then.

377
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,099
Then Yoon Hee passed away.

378
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,099
I was lonely,

379
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,700
and Tae Jin approached me.

380
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,509
I was tempted for a while...

381
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,650
but believed it would soon pass.

382
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,480
It somehow turned this way.

383
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,619
Before Jun Seo died,

384
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,190
did he know...

385
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,289
about you and Tae Jin?

386
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,329
Yes.

387
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,170
(February 13, 2024)

388
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,099
Are you still up?

389
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,109
Why did you wait up?

390
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm going to bed.

391
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,990
Ji Yeon.

392
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,190
When did it begin?

393
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,230
What?

394
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Did it happen...

395
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,829
before Yoon Hee left?

396
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,170
Or after?

397
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,839
Does that matter?

398
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,710
I'm sorry.

399
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,849
I don't think it matters.

400
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,950
When was that?

401
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,880
About ten days before my husband died.

402
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,559
Tae Jin came to me this morning...

403
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,029
and realized that the password I had<br>was the same as yours.

404
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,069
He then turned around and left.

405
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,900
I had to part ways with Yoon Hee<br>and then Jun Seo.

406
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,069
I was scared<br>of having Tae Jin leave me too.

407
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,849
I wondered how he would act...

408
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,180
once I told him the password.

409
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,349
I was afraid he'd leave me.

410
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,519
I wasn't sure how I'd survive<br>in this world alone.

411
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,890
Yes.

412
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,299
So this was where I ended up.

413
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,640
It's what I rightfully deserve.

414
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:57,809
That was the thought in my head.

415
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
(Anhyeon Police Station)

416
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:09,549
Captain.

417
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:19,230
Kang Si Jung's most recent call<br>reached somewhere in Inju-dong.

418
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,400
The other person used a burner phone.

419
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,930
Can you track the location of that number?

420
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:25,099
Yes, it's possible.

421
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,240
Do you want me to go in instead?

422
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
I'll do it.

423
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,660
Is Yoon Ho well?

424
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,170
You went to Inju-dong this morning.

425
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,569
Is Yoon Ho there?

426
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Si Jung.

427
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,140
Yoon Ho is in a dangerous state.

428
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,009
We don't know who he'll harm next.

429
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,680
We must get him to turn himself in.

430
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,150
Jong Soo, Tae Jin, and Chi Hyun.

431
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,450
They're not interested in helping him.

432
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:20,259
If you have hopes<br>that they'll help out, you're mistaken.

433
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,400
Even right now,

434
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,859
the only one who can save Yoon Ho...

435
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,599
is you.

436
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,349
He didn't even ask.

437
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,089
If the kids and I were doing okay.

438
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,359
If any of us had been scared.

439
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,259
Or how I'd found him.

440
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,130
He didn't ask any of that.

441
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
All he said was...

442
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,170
"Have you heard from Chi Hyun?"

443
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,609
"Why haven't you done anything?"

444
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,339
"You should've gone<br>to Jong Soo or Tae Jin."

445
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,910
"What were you doing at home?"

446
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,250
That's all he said.

447
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,380
I got upset...

448
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,250
and asked if he wasn't worried<br>about me or the kids.

449
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:29,329
He told me not to worry<br>because Tae Jin and Jong Soo...

450
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,460
wouldn't ditch him this time.

451
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,299
The moron.

452
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,500
Would they have let it come to this<br>if they were going to help?

453
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:43,109
Do you know whose fault it was...

454
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,670
when Yoon Ho first went away for murder?

455
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,910
That was on Won Jong Soo too.

456
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,849
I went to him so many times...

457
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,079
and begged for his help.

458
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,190
I pleaded to him.

459
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,390
Only Chi Hyun and Jun Seo<br>visited him in prison.

460
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,799
Can you...

461
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,170
bring Yoon Ho in...

462
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,940
so he doesn't get hurt?

463
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,809
Can you give me your word?

464
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,049
Pine Motel in Inju-dong.

465
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,089
Pilo-dong murder suspect Jeong Yoon Ho.

466
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,089
He's hiding at Pine Motel in Inju-dong.

467
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,829
Send backup.

468
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,200
Your kids are home alone, right?

469
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,539
I'll get someone to drive you.

470
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,890
(Jeonghaejang Motel)

471
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,529
He checked out two hours ago.

472
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,970
What about his phone signal?

473
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,329
It's still in the neighborhood.

474
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,339
He'll have gone to another motel.

475
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:21,769
Send his description...

476
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,670
- to the patrol units.<br>- Okay.

477
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,680
We'll visit nearby motels.

478
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,539
- Get to it.<br>- I'll go this way.

479
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,920
This suspect's in the neighborhood,<br>so be on the lookout.

480
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,180
Hello, it's the police.

481
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:08,179
We won't enter the room.<br>We just want a peek.

482
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,190
Excuse us.

483
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,789
Excuse us. Sorry.

484
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,659
(A1 Motel)

485
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,530
(A1 Motel)

486
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,590
Sang Eui. Come on in.

487
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,090
Hey, Sang Eui.

488
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,360
You're in a coat?

489
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,690
Looking good.

490
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,429
Something great happened today,

491
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:59,000
so I called my friends<br>who suffered with me for a drink.

492
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,769
Sang Eui you were always researching,

493
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,769
manufacturing, and now delivering too.

494
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,579
- You were busy, right?<br>- Yes.

495
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,179
Take a seat.

496
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,610
I didn't say you could sit.

497
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:20,889
Sang Eui.

498
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,159
Did you meet with Jae Gyeong?

499
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,900
Yes.

500
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,530
I knew it.

501
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,300
You told Jae Gyeong...

502
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,840
we were all there...

503
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,909
the night Jun Seo died?

504
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,639
Yes, but I just...

505
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:52,989
It's okay. You did great.

506
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,360
But you should watch what you say now.

507
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,260
Because of what you said,

508
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,599
Jae Gyeong came to me and strutted about.

509
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,400
Right. Sorry.

510
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,539
From now on, can you lot watch out...

511
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,010
so I don't have to put up with that again?

512
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,849
Especially you.

513
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,150
From now on,

514
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,179
if Jae Gyeong says something,<br>talk right back at him.

515
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,619
Why worry when I'm behind you?

516
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,119
- Right?<br>- Yes.

517
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:39,099
Oh, Prosecutor Park. Welcome.

518
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,610
Our hidden mastermind.

519
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,940
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

520
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,139
You did well planning all this.

521
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,750
I'm sorry to be a party pooper.

522
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,420
When will you meet Mayor Joo?

523
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,280
You are a party pooper.

524
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,920
That name is banned in my house,<br>you know.

525
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,030
I'm meeting him for lunch tomorrow<br>with Vice President Han.

526
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:05,929
It won't be like last time.

527
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,159
I hope so.

528
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,869
Let's have a toast.

529
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,300
To the great success...

530
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,940
of the Pilo-dong venture!

531
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,010
- Cheers.<br>- Cheers.

532
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,489
Since I pooped on the party,<br>I'd like to speak with the group.

533
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,219
Hey, Sang Eui. Wait outside.

534
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:36,389
Okay.

535
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,599
(New recording)

536
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,170
What's this about?

537
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,769
I met Jeong Yoon Ho yesterday.

538
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,010
- Yesterday?<br>- Yes.

539
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,880
We met in a quiet place,<br>and I gave him some cash.

540
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,679
I told him to lie low<br>until things quietened down.

541
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,420
Jang Jae Gyeong came to see me yesterday.

542
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,159
He got all excited, I see.

543
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,860
He came to see me today.

544
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,190
What did he say?

545
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,360
The obvious.

546
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,000
So what about Jeong Yoon Ho?

547
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,199
The police are pretty sure...

548
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,510
he's guilty of murdering<br>Lee Myung Guk and the mill owner.

549
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,539
They have a car and CCTV tapes<br>that prove it was him.

550
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,210
Here's the problem.

551
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,750
Why he killed Lee Myung Guk,

552
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
where the body was kept frozen,

553
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,289
and why he killed the mill owner<br>and burned the CCTV server.

554
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,659
If the police keep digging,

555
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,219
eventually...

556
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:44,989
it'll lead to you.

557
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,670
What's the conclusion?<br>What do you want to do?

558
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,409
Jeong Yoon Ho.

559
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,409
He's too much of a risk.

560
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,480
Then what?

561
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,480
Do you really want to kill him?

562
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Park Tae Jin.

563
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,559
Do you have a better idea?

564
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,530
I'm getting tired, to be honest.

565
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,869
We'd barely make it<br>even if we worked as a team,

566
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,869
but you lot keep messing up.

567
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,239
If something goes wrong,<br>you ask me to clean up after you.

568
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,280
Guys. What more can I do for you?

569
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,250
Hey. That's not right.

570
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,679
What did we come this far for?

571
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,190
It was so we'd all do well.

572
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,190
- But Yoon Ho...<br>- Hey.

573
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,289
You have no excuses.

574
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,730
Why did you kill Lee Myung Guk?

575
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,929
- Hey, that was...<br>- Don't use Jeong Yoon Ho as an excuse.

576
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,429
Did you ever consult with us...

577
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,969
that you were being threatened<br>by Lee Myung Guk?

578
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,500
You just make trouble first<br>without thinking,

579
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,570
and now what?

580
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,639
Are you asking us to understand<br>since you did it for a friend?

581
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,280
Oh Chi Hyun.

582
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,909
How many times is this already?

583
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Did you perhaps...

584
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,619
use this chance<br>to do something to Lee Myung Guk...

585
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,289
because you had something rotten<br>to cover up?

586
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,420
What? "Something rotten?"

587
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:20,619
I mean,

588
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
who knows if you smuggled<br>Jong Soo's pills?

589
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,599
Hey, what are you doing?

590
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,630
Say that again. What?

591
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,699
Hey, Oh Chi Hyun!

592
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,369
If we dawdle, we're all done for.

593
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,269
If the police find him before we do,<br>we're all done for!

594
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,039
- Jong Soo.<br>- Jong Soo, this isn't right.

595
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,409
What's not right?

596
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,380
If we keep doing this,<br>we're all done for!

597
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,610
Won Jong Soo.

598
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,550
Let's think about this a little more.

599
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,920
- Jong Soo!<br>- "Jong Soo!" Give it a rest!

600
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,929
What do you want me to do?

601
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,500
You always bring me one choice<br>and ask me to choose.

602
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:02,530
Hey, if you come up with the answers<br>and ask me to decide,

603
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,130
isn't that an order?

604
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,369
That's always your problem.

605
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,309
Just hang on a little longer.

606
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,510
See what the police are up to.

607
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,780
If we really get backed into a corner,

608
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:20,449
let's decide then.

609
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,889
Darn it.

610
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,630
(You have one new voicemail.<br>Press the Call button to listen.)

611
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,699
(Dialing, Restricted number)

612
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,329
The police are pretty sure...

613
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,699
he's guilty of murdering<br>Lee Myung Guk and the mill owner.

614
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,539
Why he killed Lee Myung Guk,

615
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:19,039
where the body was kept frozen,

616
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:22,949
and why he killed the mill owner<br>and burned the CCTV server.

617
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,079
If the police keep digging,

618
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,619
eventually...

619
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,019
it'll lead to you.

620
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:29,550
Jeong Yoon Ho.

621
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,250
He's too much of a risk.

622
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,159
Do you have a better idea?

623
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,130
(You have a new message.<br>Would you like to check?)

624
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:43,730
The proof that<br>Park Tae Jin killed Jun Seo...

625
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,070
is with that woman<br>who lives at Jun Seo's place.

626
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,710
Yes, this is Oh Soo Hyun.

627
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,050
Is that so? Which direction is it?

628
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,449
Past Namho-dong, towards the new town?

629
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,250
We just got a ping from<br>Jeong Yoon Ho's phone again.

630
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,289
He's moving past Namho-dong<br>and headed towards the new town.

631
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,289
Let's hurry.

632
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,650
Hello?

633
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,590
It's me.

634
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,989
Hey, Jeong Yoon Ho.<br>Where are you right now?

635
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,460
Were you there too<br>when Park Tae Jin suggested killing me?

636
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
What?

637
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
You were there too, right?

638
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,800
Don't act dumb, you punk.<br>It sounded like he was talking to you.

639
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,570
How do you know about that?

640
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,000
Was Jong Soo there too?

641
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,170
No.

642
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,170
Jong Soo would've fallen<br>for Park Tae Jin again.

643
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,739
Hey, Yoon Ho.

644
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:00,679
Darn it. You traitors.

645
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,280
Hey, are you really my friend?

646
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,750
Are you really my friend?<br>It was all Park Tae Jin!

647
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
What?

648
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,420
Park Tae Jin planned everything,<br>you dumb punks!

649
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,849
I caught Park Tae Jin getting together...

650
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,360
with Jun Seo's wife. So, that's...

651
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,190
That's why he's trying to kill me.<br>Do you even know?

652
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,489
Gosh, you utter fools.

653
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,260
You were played by Park Tae Jin<br>your whole life,

654
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,000
but you don't even know a thing, do you?

655
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,630
Hey, Yoon Ho. First of all, calm down.

656
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,969
Where are you right now?<br>Tell me that first.

657
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:26,170
I'll be right there.

658
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,269
Why? So you can come and kill me?

659
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,170
Forget it, punk. Crazy jerk.

660
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,110
Yoon Ho.

661
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,280
I'm going to reveal everything.

662
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,510
Okay?

663
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,480
The fact that Park Tae Jin<br>killed our Jun Seo...

664
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,050
I'll reveal all of it,

665
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,619
even if I have to kill<br>that wench to do so.

666
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:42,619
Hey, Yoon Ho.

667
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,489
- Jeong Yoon Ho.<br>- Hey, Oh Chi Hyun.

668
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,960
Please deliver this message<br>to Mr. Park Tae Jin.

669
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,920
I won't go down easily this time.

670
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,260
We'll all die together.

671
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,059
Or we'll all live together. Got it?

672
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,369
Jeong Yoon Ho!

673
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,369
Why do you keep calling my name?

674
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,190
Yes.

675
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,960
The signal stopped<br>near Oeseong-dong just now.

676
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,019
I've just sent you<br>the exact location via text.

677
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,300
Oeseong-dong.

678
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,300
Nain Apartment in Oeseong-dong. Hurry!

679
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,150
What?

680
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,889
What brings you by at this hour?

681
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,489
Hey, Ji Yeon.

682
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:01,400
I have something to say to you<br>about Jun Seo.

683
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,599
One moment.

684
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,510
(Detective Jang Jae Gyeong)

685
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,639
Hello.

686
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,980
Hello.

687
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,650
My gosh. Let's go.

688
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:35,329
What did you want to tell me<br>about Jun Seo?

689
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,579
Do you miss Jun Seo?

690
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:52,920
Pardon?

691
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,820
I miss Jun Seo.

692
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,320
I married Si Jung.

693
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,730
And Si Jung had a baby.

694
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:08,329
Our Young Eun.

695
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,769
But I hadn't found a job.

696
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Then,

697
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,239
Jun Seo talked to Jong Soo,

698
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,639
and he got me a job<br>at one of Keumhyung's subcontractors.

699
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,219
But the CEO there...

700
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,849
was talking smack about Jong Soo one day.

701
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,489
I kept listening...

702
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,760
but couldn't stand it anymore.

703
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,829
I had had a few drinks,<br>and I hit him in anger.

704
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:41,829
But...

705
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:44,599
that man died.

706
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
What...

707
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,710
It's late tonight. If you come back...

708
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,480
Then, I got out of jail.

709
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:04,420
It felt as though the guys<br>were keeping their distance from me.

710
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,889
Even then, Jun Seo looked out for me.

711
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:09,320
He found me a job at the taxi company.

712
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,289
Looking back,

713
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Jun Seo was different from the other guys.

714
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:19,699
I think...

715
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,599
he was a good friend...

716
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:25,139
to me.

717
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,010
Oh, I see.

718
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,750
So... I understand what you mean,

719
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,980
but you should get going...

720
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,219
So why did you do it?

721
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,650
Why would you leave<br>a nice guy like Jun Seo...

722
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,159
and do that with Tae Jin?

723
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,130
You killed Jun Seo with Tae Jin,<br>didn't you?

724
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,639
No.

725
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,309
I know you did.

726
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,409
I heard the evidence that shows<br>you killed Jun Seo with Tae Jin...

727
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,539
is here.

728
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:04,250
Where is it?

729
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,920
What do you mean?

730
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,090
Tae Jin is trying<br>to put all the blame on me...

731
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:15,960
and is planning to kill me.

732
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,989
Ji Yeon.

733
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,260
I can't just sit and watch.

734
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,030
Hand it over.

735
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,489
- I'll take the stairs.<br>- Okay.

736
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:08,679
Choi Ji Yeon.

737
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:10,550
Choi Ji Yeon!

738
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,880
Thank you for your time.

739
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:31,900
- What is it at this hour?<br>- Park Tae Jin.

740
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,199
- You know Jun Seo's passcode, right?<br>- What?

741
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,239
Hurry up and tell me.<br>Ji Yeon is in danger.

742
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:37,739
What's the door's passcode?

743
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:40,309
It's 9-1-9-1.

744
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:48,949
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon.

745
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:50,750
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon.

746
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:52,719
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon.

747
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,130
She's still breathing.<br>Call an ambulance right away!

748
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,099
I'm calling from Oeseong-dong's<br>Nain Apartment, Unit 503.

749
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,530
There's a patient here. Please hurry.

750
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:21,849
Jeong Yoon Ho escaped<br>via the emergency stairs.

751
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,219
Request support<br>from the nearby patrol unit.

752
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:36,489
I don't need it. I can do this.

753
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,989
Captain, do you remember the guy<br>who had drugs on him...

754
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,760
out of the men we arrested yesterday?

755
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,329
- Lee Jung Hoon.<br>- What about him?

756
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:14,630
He says he bought his drugs<br>from a guy named Kim Dae Sung,

757
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,130
and Kim Dae Sung...

758
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,130
is already under examination<br>by the Narcotics Unit.

759
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,340
So I wonder if we should ask them<br>to cooperate with us...

760
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,340
Hey.

761
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,239
- Go and get this guy.<br>- Pardon?

762
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,250
The Narcotics Unit always steals<br>our cases.

763
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,309
We can't just sit and watch.

764
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,150
Let's dig into this guy, Kim Dae Sung.

765
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,690
We'll find all the connections from him<br>from the ground up. Got it?

766
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,159
Take your grills out.

767
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,199
Take them out.<br>Chew with your real teeth.

768
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:54,739
What a joke.

769
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,940
Here. Have this too.

770
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:02,780
Enjoy your meal.

771
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,510
Eat slowly.

772
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,110
- Thank you.<br>- Sure.

773
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,579
By the way,

774
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,320
that captain of the Narcotics Unit...

775
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,190
is really something.

776
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,090
Who? Jang Jae Gyeong?

777
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:20,059
Yes...

778
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,059
Can't you read the room?

779
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,400
Keep your mouth shut and eat.

780
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,070
Punk.

781
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,070
What is it? Tell me?

782
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:33,010
What's so great about him?

783
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:37,110
That thing is really strong,

784
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:41,920
so it's not easy for an ordinary person<br>to stay sober with that drug.

785
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:44,619
And?

786
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,250
Drug?

787
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:47,989
What drug?

788
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,929
The day I was arrested,

789
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,260
Geun Ho drugged that detective...

790
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,460
with the new drug, Lemon Mulberry.

791
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,230
Geun Ho did it to check<br>if he was a detective or not.

792
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,900
He took in the full dose.

793
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:06,010
If you're not a druggie<br>and it's your first time,

794
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,480
most people faint.

795
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,980
But he threw me on the floor right away.

796
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,519
I totally respect him for that.

797
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:19,690
Hey, tell us more.

798
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,860
(Ambulance)

799
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:34,369
Are you getting a signal?

800
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,500
I think the phone is turned off.

801
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:39,239
We're searching the area<br>with the patrol unit.

802
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,039
Why did Jeong Yoon Ho come here?

803
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:45,949
Is there a reason for him<br>to kill Park Jun Seo's wife?

804
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:48,250
Do you have a hunch?

805
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,650
I also can't understand it.<br>The scene looked strange too.

806
00:55:52,389 --> 00:55:55,190
He turned the place upside down<br>as if he was searching for something.

807
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:58,260
Also, if he really had wanted to kill her,

808
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,130
he could've done it in a flash<br>like the mill owner.

809
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,769
Aside from her head wound,<br>we didn't find anything else.

810
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,170
All the knives were untouched too.

811
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,639
Maybe he heard the siren...

812
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,670
and couldn't finish her off<br>before fleeing.

813
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,710
Maybe he staged it<br>like a robbery on purpose.

814
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,849
Which hospital is that ambulance heading?

815
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,550
To Anhyun University Hospital. Why?

816
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,489
I will drop by the hospital...

817
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:27,360
and check on the victim<br>before I head back.

818
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,630
Let me know if you find<br>Jeong Yoon Ho's whereabouts.

819
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,960
I will.

820
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,659
Captain. Do you want a ride?

821
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,030
I'm okay.

822
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Ms. Oh!

823
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,610
- Hello.<br>- Why are you so busy these days?

824
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,969
You're never home.

825
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,039
I have a lot of work these days.

826
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:49,639
- Is everything well?<br>- Of course.

827
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,710
Here.

828
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,019
- What is this?<br>- You left your coat with me, remember?

829
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,820
The black one.

830
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:58,519
This was in the inner pocket.

831
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:00,789
(From Anhyun University Hospital,<br>Park Eun Young, To Park Jun Seo)

832
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:06,489
(From Anhyun University Hospital,<br>Park Eun Young, To Park Jun Seo)

833
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,610
- Sorry for the long wait.<br>- Not at all.

834
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,519
(Dear Ma'am and Sir,)

835
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,489
Thank you.

836
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,750
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon's guardian?

837
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Yes?

838
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,480
(Emergency Medical Center)

839
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,349
We ran through all emergency tests...

840
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:06,250
and aside from her head contusion,

841
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,360
she has a light concussion.

842
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,119
It's not life-threatening, is it?

843
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,829
No. But we'll run a few other tests<br>just in case.

844
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:16,159
We have an empty room,<br>so we'll move her there.

845
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,429
It'd be best to keep her here<br>until tomorrow.

846
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,530
I understand.

847
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:23,500
You look pale. Are you all right?

848
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,239
Your eyes are red.

849
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,570
I'm fine.

850
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:28,340
I'm just tired.

851
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,510
I see.

852
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,400
How is she doing?

853
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,230
Is it life-threatening?

854
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,940
Did you put him up to it?

855
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,440
Did you order him to kill Choi Ji Yeon?

856
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,610
Are you out of your mind?

857
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,539
What is it that you want?

858
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:05,880
How far do you have to go?

859
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:09,119
Which one of us do you need dead<br>for you to be happy?

860
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,550
What?

861
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,619
Did you sell drugs with Jun Seo?

862
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:21,559
You made Lee Myung Guk make drugs<br>in Youngryun Cold Storage.

863
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,460
But when he stopped listening,<br>you killed him,

864
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,670
and then you killed Park Jun Seo.

865
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,739
You ordered Jeong Yoon Ho<br>to kill the owner of the mill.

866
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:28,869
But that wasn't enough.

867
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,010
Now you're trying to kill the woman<br>you're having an affair with.

868
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,679
Do you call yourself human?

869
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,809
What nonsense are you spewing?

870
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:38,150
Why?

871
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,380
Why me? Why did you drag me into it?

872
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,920
What?

873
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,989
What are you trying to get from it?

874
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:46,849
You punk!

875
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:49,760
Darn it.

876
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,630
How dare you hit me?

877
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,929
What's wrong with you?

878
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,199
Are you on something?

879
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,269
Why would I kill Choi Ji Yeon?

880
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,769
Why would I kill Lee Myung Guk<br>or Park Jun Seo?

881
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,110
For what?

882
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,639
Hey. Stop deluding yourself.

883
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,750
Do you think I had an affair with her...

884
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:13,650
because of the password?

885
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,650
She doesn't even have a clue!

886
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:19,719
Hey.

887
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,860
Hey.

888
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:23,219
Look at me straight in the eyes.

889
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,829
You accuse me of distributing drugs.

890
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:27,829
Do you have any proof?

891
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:32,429
Can you back anything you said?

892
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:34,969
Darn you.

893
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,539
You don't know anything.

894
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,309
If you dare touch me again,

895
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,679
I'll make sure the police let you go.

896
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,409
Try me again if you dare.

897
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:47,750
You're no game for me.

898
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,860
You almost choked me to death,<br>remember?

899
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,730
You only care about yourself, don't you?

900
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,170
Jang Jae Gyeong, are you all right?

901
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:21,320
(Connection)

902
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,349
He must have caused trouble.

903
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,349
Exactly.

904
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,389
(Jang Jae Gyeong,<br>forced to transfer schools)

905
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:31,530
(Science Lab 2)

906
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:35,000
Jang Jae Gyeong kept his back on us,<br>so I had him get transferred.

907
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,900
What about Jun Seo?

908
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:40,469
What should we do with him?

909
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,570
But Jun Seo chose...

910
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,610
our side.

911
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:46,769
Hey.

912
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,940
If my father hadn't threatened his dad...

913
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,949
to turn Jun Seo's mind around,

914
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,280
would he have chosen us?

915
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,460
I doubt it.

916
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,659
He should've never hung out<br>with Jae Gyeong, Yoon Jin, and Joo Song.

917
01:02:03,659 --> 01:02:05,960
It was his fault. Don't you agree?

918
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,800
Jae Gyeong must know what happened...

919
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,329
at Kyung Tae's house...

920
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,230
because Jun Seo told him.

921
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:16,139
Jun Seo is the root cause of this problem.

922
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,340
Still...

923
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:21,340
- He's the class president.<br>- Enough with the class president!

924
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:25,079
The class president was the one<br>who ruined everything, Yoon Ho!

925
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,719
I think we should still accept him<br>as our friend.

926
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,449
I think he regrets it.

927
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,219
Let's do that, Jong Soo.

928
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:37,360
What do you think, Tae Jin?

929
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:40,530
Let's wrap it up<br>with having Jae Gyeong transfer.

930
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:42,500
There's no reason to blow this up.

931
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,400
He's right.

932
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,630
Let's do that.

933
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:51,869
Fine.

934
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,039
We'll let Jun Seo back in the group.

935
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,380
Is that enough?

936
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,650
Jun Seo and Yoon Jin...

937
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,519
They're still dating.

938
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,260
Then what can we do?

939
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:13,130
We'll have to make him end it on his own.

940
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,730
Come to Audiophile's club room right now.

941
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,000
I have to tell you something<br>about Jun Seo.

942
01:03:30,909 --> 01:03:31,980
Hey, Park Jun Seo!

943
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,920
What are you doing?

944
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:38,349
Leave.

945
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:40,119
- Jun Seo.<br>- I said, leave.

946
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,489
Go!

947
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,690
Go! I said, go!

948
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,000
Don't ever call my name...

949
01:03:52,269 --> 01:03:53,269
or talk to me.

950
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,070
Jun Seo.

951
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,440
Hey! Park Jun Seo!

952
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,820
(Jeong Sang Eui)

953
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:01,699
(Connection)

954
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,199
I want my share<br>of what we earned up to now.

955
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,409
Park Jun Seo.

956
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:05,909
I'm telling you we should stop!

957
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:08,510
Is it true? Did you fool around<br>with Jun Seo's wife?

958
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,309
Did you really kill Park Jun Seo?

959
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,219
I'm Park Tae Jin. I'm the Doctor.

960
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:16,619
You're sticking right beside Jae Gyeong<br>and telling him everything.

961
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,750
It's not me.

962
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,190
Don't lie.

963
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,619
You were a drug dealer.

964
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,130
How can you plan and construct<br>the future of Keumhyung Group?

965
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,130
Chairman.

966
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,329
It sounds like a job for you to wrap up.

967
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:27,360
Jong Soo...

968
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,230
Jae Gyeong!

969
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Jang Jae Gyeong!

970
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,630
Wake up.

971
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,699
Drug...

972
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,409
What have I done to you<br>for you to drug me?

973
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,469
Stop smiling and answer me!
