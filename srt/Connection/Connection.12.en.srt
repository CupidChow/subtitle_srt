1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,179
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,220
Do those pills no longer work now?

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,730
Tell me if you need more. I'll get them.

4
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,070
Even eight pills can't get
the job done now.

5
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,300
Eight?

6
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,909
Hey.
You can't take more than five at a time.

7
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,340
It'll ruin your liver.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,340
I know.

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,380
How did you know to come here?

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,679
I was wondering
which punks were fighting at a hospital,

11
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,789
and it was you two.

12
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,450
Didn't you come here
after hearing Choi Ji Yeon's news?

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,060
"Choi Ji Yeon?"

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,060
Jeong Yoon Ho went to see Choi Ji Yeon.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,090
And?

16
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,130
She's badly hurt,
but it's not life-threatening.

17
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,170
They need to run some more tests.

18
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,040
What's wrong with Yoon Ho?

19
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,209
Is he really the Yoon Ho we used to know?

20
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,049
Hey, this won't do.

21
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,609
Take a taxi and go home. Okay?

22
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,280
Get some sleep first.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
I came here...

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,560
to see the doctor
who treated Jun Seo's daughter.

25
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,420
He's in emergency surgery,
and I can only see him in the morning.

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,390
I'll call if something happens to Ji Yeon.

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,799
I doubt Yoon Ho would show up here.

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,140
(Connection)

29
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,180
(Episode 12)

30
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,120
Hey.

31
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,519
We just parted ways.

32
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,049
Why did you call me over here again?

33
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,689
I'm meeting Mayor Joo tomorrow.

34
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,319
Do you think Yoon Ho was arrested?

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,400
Did you have Tae Jin tailed as I asked?

36
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,730
Yes.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,810
Why am I back here?

38
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,909
What did Yoon Ho do now?

39
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,639
Jeong Yoon Ho.

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,719
He tried and failed
to kill Jun Seo's widow and fled.

41
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,780
Who tried to kill whom?

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,689
I don't know why, but he's out of control.

43
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,689
He won't take my calls.

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,629
This is why I said
we should deal with him quickly.

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,289
It's out of my hands now.

46
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,030
Are you blaming me
for what Yoon Ho's doing?

47
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,229
You think killing a friend is a joke?

48
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,370
How many times must I say
it's over if we miss the chance?

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,800
You should've been decisive
when it was required.

50
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,409
What will you do now?

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,039
If we let Yoon Ho loose,

52
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,009
he'll be caught in two days.

53
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,580
The darn lunatic.
This is such an important time for me.

54
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,219
Yoon Ho called me.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
What? When?

56
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,189
About two hours ago.

57
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,530
The conversation we had earlier.

58
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,669
He sounded as if he'd heard a recording.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A recording?

60
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:17,969
From here?

61
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,139
You said you set something up
to block listening devices.

62
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,610
You told me to turn it off
because you hated the high-frequency buzz.

63
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,550
So what?

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,550
What did Yoon Ho say?

65
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,150
He said he knew we'd kill him...

66
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,150
and that he wouldn't go easily, but...

67
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,120
He said something weird.

68
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,129
That it was all you.

69
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,759
That you're manipulating us all.

70
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,659
What?

71
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,539
You lost your mind
because you're cornered.

72
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:51,539
Hey, you.

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,210
Is it true? Did you fool around
with Jun Seo's wife?

74
00:03:58,909 --> 00:03:59,909
What?

75
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,349
Wait. You did what with whom?

76
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,020
What Yoon Ho said was true.

77
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,590
So you wanted him dead to cover it up?

78
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
Is that...

79
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:17,029
worth killing for just to cover up?

80
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,129
Yes, it's true.

81
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,899
I slept with Jun Seo's wife. So what?

82
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,139
Hey, you crazy...

83
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,870
What are you saying?

84
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,079
Did you really kill Park Jun Seo?

85
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,790
Hello?

86
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,730
Jong Soo, it's Yoon Ho.

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,370
Hello?

88
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,610
Speak.

89
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,009
Jong Soo.

90
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,240
Help me out.

91
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,079
I need you...

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,410
to step up now.

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,180
What do you mean by that?

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,920
I felt really let down this time.

95
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,019
Park Tae Jin.

96
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,120
He's a really nasty punk.

97
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,389
Do you know he's trying to kill me?

98
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
What for?

99
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:28,699
To hide the fact
he slept with Jun Seo's wife?

100
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,170
You know about that?

101
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:32,569
Yes.

102
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:36,040
Those two got rid of Jun Seo.

103
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,540
I went to his place to find proof.

104
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,139
I haven't found it yet.

105
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,910
The police happened to rush in.

106
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
So what?

107
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
I need you...

108
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,149
to scare Tae Jin.

109
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,660
Tell him that you know everything.

110
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,990
Say you know he killed Jun Seo,

111
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,389
and he needs to help me out.

112
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,430
Oh, yes. Oh Chi Hyun.

113
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,230
Don't tell him.

114
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,069
I think he's in on it with Tae Jin.

115
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:04,939
Really?

116
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,839
Yes, Jong Soo.

117
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,370
You can do anything. You're...

118
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,339
You're the future
Keumhyung Group chairman.

119
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,779
What can't you do?

120
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,319
What if I can't do that?

121
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,189
What happens then?

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,740
Then I'll be left with no choice.

123
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,709
I'll have to tell the world
you got Lee Myung Guk...

124
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,250
to make you a drug,

125
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,410
and when he blackmailed you,

126
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,879
you got me to kill him.

127
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,689
When did I ask you to kill Lee Myung Guk?

128
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,819
Jong Soo.

129
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,290
Don't do this to a friend.

130
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,459
I can tell what you want...

131
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,629
from the look in your eyes.

132
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,329
If we'd let Lee Myung Guk live,
he'd have dragged us down, you idiot.

133
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,639
Yoon Ho.

134
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:16,470
Can't you just go into hiding?

135
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,639
Do you have to do this?

136
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,680
I'm 40 years old, you know.

137
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,850
Where can I go to live in hiding?

138
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,649
What about Si Jung? And our kids?

139
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,050
I bought land...

140
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,149
because of the Pilo-dong business.

141
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,360
We're in this together!

142
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,860
Have you forgotten our students' creed?

143
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,730
"Be a helping hand to a friend!"

144
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,470
Where are you?

145
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,100
I got the point. Let's talk in person.

146
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,170
Shall we?

147
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,639
Yes, let's do that.

148
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,009
Text me a place.

149
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,910
I'll come over right away.

150
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,120
I'll be in touch. Keep your phone on.

151
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,949
Okay. Get back to me soon.

152
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,490
The police...

153
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,899
What he said.

154
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,170
How much of that is true?

155
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,180
I told you just now.

156
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,680
I did sleep with Jun Seo's wife.

157
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
That's it.

158
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,259
What?

159
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,629
Do you really think I killed Jun Seo?

160
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,629
If you guys actually suspect me,

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
I'd be so disappointed.

162
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,700
I'd accept the ridicule...

163
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,309
for sleeping with a friend's wife.

164
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:57,110
But don't you know me too little
if you'd think I'd kill Jun Seo...

165
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,179
over something like that?

166
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,340
Would I give it all up...

167
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,580
and betray you guys for a woman?

168
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,220
That's nothing.

169
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
If it's not that,

170
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,519
why didn't you look into
Jun Seo's death yourself?

171
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,490
I think I would have.

172
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,159
Do you...

173
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,460
still think he killed himself?

174
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
There is a possibility he was murdered.

175
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,730
But why would I bother?

176
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,870
Jae Gyeong came to see you all.

177
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,610
He's doing all the hard work
to claim the insurance money.

178
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Won Jong Soo.

179
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,220
Making Jun Seo work for you
for 20 years wasn't enough,

180
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,990
so you made him deliver drugs too.

181
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,230
Didn't you use the 5,000 dollars...

182
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,529
his daughter needed
for treatment to crush him?

183
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,899
I bet Jun Seo called you and said this.

184
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
"The drugs made
at Youngryun Cold Storage,"

185
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,870
"the fact that
you get a delivery every week,"

186
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,809
"and that you can't go three days
without a dose."

187
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,480
"I'll tell the whole world."

188
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,350
That's why you came
to the construction site that night.

189
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,779
Jong Soo.

190
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,220
You honestly wanted Jun Seo dead.
Wasn't it you?

191
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,190
Shut your mouth.

192
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Or...

193
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,830
was it you?

194
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,090
What?

195
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,759
Did it bother you to kill a friend?

196
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,169
So you got someone else to do it?

197
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
What nonsense is that?

198
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,840
Lee Myung Guk's murder...

199
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,039
Jun Seo said he'd tell the police.

200
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,379
That's why you came
to the construction site.

201
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,679
You said so yourself.

202
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,009
Are you denying that now?

203
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,649
You...

204
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,279
weren't even that close to Jun Seo.

205
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,679
What about you?

206
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,389
What were you doing there?

207
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,990
What did Jun Seo say to make you show up?

208
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,289
This is it.

209
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:56,789
What?

210
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,659
This is it.

211
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,929
This is what Jun Seo wanted
when he left...

212
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,299
the insurance money
to Jae Gyeong and Yoon Jin.

213
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,009
He wanted us to fight, doubt,

214
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,470
threaten each other, and curse.

215
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Guys.

216
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,139
All three of us...

217
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,809
had good enough reason
to want Jun Seo dead.

218
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,980
But so what?

219
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
What are you going to do?

220
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,850
What?

221
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:26,090
What do you want to do by fighting...

222
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,830
about figuring out who killed Jun Seo?

223
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,830
Get your acts together, you idiots.

224
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,929
The urgent matter on our hands isn't
Park Jun Seo, who's already dead,

225
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,399
but Jeong Yoon Ho.

226
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,700
Got it?

227
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,990
Where should I tell him to come to?

228
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,690
You should decide
wherever is convenient for you.

229
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,159
It seems like something
you'll have to take care of.

230
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,730
Jong Soo.

231
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,679
Jong Soo.

232
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,230
Chi Hyun!

233
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,629
What are you doing right now?

234
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,529
Hey, don't do this. Chi Hyun.

235
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,870
Hey, it was Park Tae Jin.
It was all his doing!

236
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,409
- Go quietly.
- Hey!

237
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,440
It was all Park Tae Jin's doing!

238
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
That's enough.

239
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,679
Chi Hyun, we can't do this between us.

240
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,019
We can't do this between us!

241
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,950
I know.

242
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,220
That's why I told you to stay down.

243
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,059
Why do you always do things
that no one asked you to do?

244
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,230
I was trying to do what was right!

245
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,759
I wanted to do a good job.
You know, I had to do something.

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,129
That way, Jong Soo would take
one more look at me.

247
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,240
Save me. Please?

248
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,539
Save me! Chi Hyun.

249
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,110
Chi Hyun, what about Si Jung?

250
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,940
Hey, if I die, your nieces...

251
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,649
What about Young Eun and Young Ji?

252
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:35,809
Hey, what will you do about...

253
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,909
- Young Eun and Young Ji?
- Be quiet.

254
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,950
Turn your head.

255
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
You idiot!

256
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,350
Do you think
those guys consider you a friend?

257
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,759
They don't!

258
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,960
Those guys only call you...

259
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,889
whenever they need you, you idiot.

260
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:52,899
Hey, Chi Hyun.

261
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
You know,

262
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:56,470
I wanted to be like you.

263
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,200
They don't ask me to do anything.

264
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,610
They don't ask me to do anything!

265
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,139
If I worked hard,

266
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,980
I could get to visit
the place you gather in Pilo-dong...

267
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,450
and just hang out...

268
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,850
- You fool.
- with you guys!

269
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,250
Like back in the day, I wanted to...

270
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,049
Chi Hyun. I wanted to do that.

271
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,690
Chi Hyun, no!

272
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,299
Hello.

273
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,529
Is Dr. Park Eun Young finished
with surgery?

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,539
I was here yesterday.

275
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,309
Dr. Park.

276
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,340
(Ultrasound room)

277
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,480
In the letters,

278
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,179
it said that
Yoon Hee could've been treated in the US.

279
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,220
What was that about?

280
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,690
The medicine used
for Yoon Hee's condition...

281
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,659
was rather expensive
and not covered by insurance.

282
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,230
And it was only effective enough
to stop her symptoms from worsening.

283
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,730
But then,

284
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,870
I was contacted about wanting to use
a newly developed drug in the US.

285
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,200
But why didn't they go?

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,240
It was because of the costs.

287
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,639
How much would it have been?

288
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,840
It was 500,000 dollars.

289
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,250
Yoon Hee's dad told me that
he would come up with the money somehow...

290
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,549
and for me not to lose
that chance for her.

291
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,289
But Yoon Hee...

292
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,059
didn't wait for us.

293
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,990
You...

294
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,559
died here today.

295
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,900
Don't ever show up around us again.

296
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,970
Don't think of seeing
Si Jung or the kids either.

297
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,400
You and me...

298
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,900
Our friendship ends here.

299
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,390
The students' creed!

300
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,690
One!

301
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,599
"Be someone who performs one's duty!"

302
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,069
Two!

303
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,910
"Be true to one's goal!"

304
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,109
Three!

305
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,750
"Be..."

306
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:01,589
"a helping hand to a friend!"

307
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,160
All right.

308
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,930
Here we go.

309
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,200
(Anhyun Stream)

310
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,039
Hey, Detective Kim.

311
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,240
Is your arm okay?

312
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,150
Yes, it's fine.

313
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,009
That's good.

314
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:04,779
The Unit Chief...

315
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,950
got called to the Chief's office
again this morning.

316
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,789
She must've had an earful.

317
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,829
- You're here.
- Yes, ma'am.

318
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,759
What did the doctor say?

319
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,329
I have a sprained wrist.

320
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,500
I have to watch out for a few days.

321
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,539
It's good it wasn't worse.

322
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,910
I'm sorry to cause you concern.

323
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,769
Forget it.

324
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,410
You see all sorts of things
when working as a cop.

325
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,579
Thanks to you, I almost got smacked
by the Chief of Police at this age,

326
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:38,549
but what can I do?

327
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,519
It's all because I lack virtue.

328
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,500
Where is the Captain?

329
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,769
He hasn't come in yet.
He won't answer his phone either.

330
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,029
- Is that so?
- Yes.

331
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,180
(Park Jun Seo)

332
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,500
What's the passcode?

333
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,539
- Zero.
- Yes?

334
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,769
- Five.
- Five?

335
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,009
Zero, two.

336
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Jae Gyeong.

337
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,089
Jang Jae Gyeong.

338
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:57,789
Jae Gyeong!

339
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,799
Jae Gyeong, come to your senses.

340
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,529
Jang Jae Gyeong!

341
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,930
Jae Gyeong.

342
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,869
Come to your senses!

343
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,970
Oh, no.

344
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,069
Jae Gyeong. Darn it.

345
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,880
Drink some water.

346
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
Jae Gyeong!

347
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,420
Wake up. Please, wake up.

348
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,259
Drug...

349
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,220
Get rid of it...

350
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,759
Okay.

351
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,109
There was
a Lemon Mulberry pill here, right?

352
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,880
There was no other way.

353
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,250
What will you do
if that situation happens again?

354
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,289
Will you take it again?

355
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Yes.

356
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,430
Hey, Straw. What is it?

357
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Yes.

358
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,509
Okay.

359
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,279
All right, I got it.

360
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,279
Send me the details via text.

361
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,680
Okay, I got it.

362
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,720
Samsol Port in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do.

363
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,750
Jangju Port in Dangjin, Chungcheongnam-do.

364
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,150
Manpyeong Port in Seosan,
Chungcheongnam-do.

365
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,220
According to Straw,
at 4:00 a.m. two days from now,

366
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,259
people will be smuggled in
through one of these three ports.

367
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,789
They're far from each other,

368
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,130
so it'll be difficult to cover them
at the same time.

369
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:40,859
This must mean it's difficult
for Straw to get info now.

370
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,470
We had one of our men show interest...

371
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,470
in smuggling out as a new attempt,

372
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,440
but these guys must be extra cautious.

373
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,940
Ask the Coast Guard
for their cooperation...

374
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,170
and get some internal support as well...

375
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,910
to try and cover all three ports.

376
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,910
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

377
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,500
What happened?
What are you doing here?

378
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,849
Don't tell me...

379
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:52,869
How many hours did I sleep?

380
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,940
Maybe two hours?

381
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:56,509
What time is it now?

382
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
It's 2:30 p.m.

383
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,130
In front of Manyang Ferry...

384
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
at Manpyeong Port, two days from now.

385
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,339
At 4:00 a.m.

386
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,180
Hey, where are you?
Is everything okay?

387
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,450
Unit Chief.

388
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,490
Did you receive any information
from Straw?

389
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,490
I did.

390
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
But he gave me the names of three ports.

391
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,259
We don't know which one.

392
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,690
Is Manpyeong Port one of them?

393
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,230
Yes, it is. How did you know?

394
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,170
That's the place.
Two days from now at 4:00 a.m.

395
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,500
All right, we'll check.

396
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Okay.

397
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I'm sorry.

398
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,890
I know very well how hard you're trying
to hold out,

399
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,160
but I didn't know what else to do.

400
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,269
It's okay.

401
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,670
I'm sure you were torn in the moment.

402
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,539
What you decided on...

403
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,910
was probably in my best interest.

404
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:44,849
How's Jun Seo's wife?

405
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,920
Well... She's okay.

406
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,750
She seems to have a lot of regrets.

407
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,789
All she did was cry.

408
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,759
Right.

409
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:59,400
I'll forward you the address
of that grandma in Boryeong...

410
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,559
in a text.

411
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,170
You remember, don't you?

412
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,670
She's the one getting the pension
from the plan Jun Seo signed up.

413
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes.

414
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,069
When do you want to go to Boryeong?

415
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,609
I think I have to head out for now.

416
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:12,809
Okay.

417
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,309
Are you going back to the station?

418
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,109
No.

419
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,420
I'm going to go see Jeong Sang Eui.

420
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,779
Sang Eui?

421
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,849
Park Tae Jin is a prosecutor,
and he's very cautious.

422
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,160
It won't be easy to investigate him.

423
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,660
It might be a good idea to use Sang Eui
to get to Tae Jin.

424
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,759
Do you want to come along?

425
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,539
What's gotten into you?

426
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,569
Well, it's not so easy to drive either.

427
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
All right.

428
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,680
See me at Myeongeul Garden tomorrow
at 4:00 p.m.

429
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:09,299
Hello?

430
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,430
We found you a boat.

431
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:12,369
It departs...

432
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,500
from Manpyeong Port
at 4:00 a.m. in two days.

433
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,109
Thank you.

434
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,740
If you leave, you won't be able to return.

435
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,680
Aren't you curious about me?

436
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,410
Pardon?

437
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,319
I'm Park Tae Jin.

438
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,990
Don't you remember me
from early last year?

439
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,859
Come on, we've met.

440
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,759
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin of Anhyun District
Public Prosecutor's Office.

441
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,170
(1 year ago in January 2023)

442
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,200
Mr. Gong Jin Wook.

443
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,269
You ran
an adult entertainment establishment...

444
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,609
two years ago
and were sentenced to six months.

445
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,670
You're back with the same charges.

446
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
What is this?

447
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,250
Take a look.

448
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,660
It's our second time making a deal
through a flash drive, isn't it?

449
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,759
Didn't I help you get indicted then?

450
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,829
Thanks for the pictures in the drive.

451
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,069
Among your secret customers,

452
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,599
there are many individuals
who act strong and mighty.

453
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,039
Are you really...

454
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,779
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin?

455
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
That's right.

456
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,410
I'm the Doctor.

457
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,119
Jin Wook.

458
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,859
Didn't you ever wonder why
you were picked as the Doctor's dealer?

459
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
You never sold drugs before...

460
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,730
and didn't have the knack for it either.

461
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,170
People like CEO Yoon who had
a lot of experience in the field seemed...

462
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,869
too difficult to handle.

463
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,140
It was somewhat too dangerous
for me to deal...

464
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,579
with CEO Yoon directly.

465
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,710
That was why I needed someone
with a brain...

466
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,779
who was also loyal and strong.

467
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,349
That was why I scouted you.

468
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,789
It was more fun than running
an adult establishment, right?

469
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,390
Why are you telling me this?

470
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,799
I told you. I'm telling you
because you won't be able to return.

471
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,730
What? What is it?

472
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,970
Will you report me to the police?

473
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,940
But who's going to believe you
if you tell them I made and sold drugs?

474
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,069
No...

475
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,440
That was not what I meant.

476
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,410
I'm just confused by it all.

477
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,279
I'm sure.

478
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,279
Anyway, take care.

479
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,349
Go to the dock at Manpyeong Port
and find Manyang Ferry...

480
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,589
at 4:00 a.m. two days from now.
Someone will show up.

481
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,329
Okay, Prosecutor. As for the drugs...

482
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,490
Thanks for all you've done.

483
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,420
- It's Jeong Sang Eui.
- What?

484
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,420
- Turn the car around.
- Okay.

485
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,210
I'll wait outside.

486
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,009
Hey.

487
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,410
Yoon Ho...

488
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:45,980
Did he leave without a word?

489
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,650
Why does that matter now?

490
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,829
If a bioindustrial complex is built,

491
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,630
Anhyun will turn
into an organic future-oriented city...

492
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,700
that is a blend of industrial
and residential.

493
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,170
I'm sure you saw my proposal,

494
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,470
but we already have the funds secured
for this project.

495
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,170
I don't have any questions.

496
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,079
However,

497
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,049
you made things look like
you're doing the city a great service.

498
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,549
What you're saying is that...

499
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,849
you'll build us
a biotechnology complex...

500
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,589
if we give you the rights
to develop a Pilo-dong plot...

501
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:27,160
three times that size
into a private sector residential area.

502
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,690
Why would Yigu Group get involved...

503
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,329
when they don't care for the city?

504
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,230
They're in it for the profit.

505
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,970
Let's do it.

506
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,940
Okay.

507
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:44,869
Thank you.

508
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,539
- Let's make it work.
- Thank you.

509
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,289
- Good job.
- Well done.

510
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,799
Didn't I tell you it would go well?

511
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,339
- Hey, look.
- Drive on.

512
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:14,869
Okay.

513
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,039
(Myeongeul Garden)

514
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,170
Turn and park here.

515
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,349
(Main building)

516
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
(Main building)

517
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,809
(Main building)

518
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:00,619
Wait here.

519
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,069
- What?
- The next room is occupied.

520
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,440
Let's go outside behind the rooms.

521
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,430
Hey. It's Park Tae Jin.

522
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,339
Why are they meeting up?

523
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,109
The Lemon Mulberry business.

524
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:01,339
Is Jeong Sang Eui
the one who replaced Jun Seo?

525
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,820
This door's closed,
so it'll be hard to listen in.

526
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,190
What's that?

527
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,590
Now do you know why my bag's so huge?

528
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,300
Do you always carry this stuff around?

529
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,570
Listen.

530
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,789
Is there something in China?

531
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,860
Yes, apparently.

532
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:50,829
Forget that.

533
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,900
Yesterday, when we all met at Pilo-dong.

534
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:56,300
Do you remember
I told you to wait outside?

535
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,869
Yes.

536
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Did you record our conversation?

537
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,639
- No.
- You didn't?

538
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,280
Then...

539
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:13,119
how did Yoon Ho know what we said?

540
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,679
Chi Hyun said...

541
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,519
it sounded like
Yoon Ho had heard a recording.

542
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,389
There's no way...

543
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,360
we'd record our chat for Yoon Ho to hear.

544
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:24,929
Right?

545
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,300
Are you saying you suspect me?

546
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:29,730
Someone told me...

547
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,170
to remember my place and act accordingly.

548
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:38,269
Sang Eui. Not all friends are equal.

549
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,940
Do you think you'd be in our group
if Jun Seo hadn't made you...

550
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,280
class secretary out of pity?

551
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:47,949
You always got beaten up,
you could never speak up,

552
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,789
and you were so slow to catch on.

553
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,559
That's what you were like.

554
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,619
You wouldn't have survived school...

555
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,690
if Jun Seo hadn't coddled you.

556
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,429
Do you think things have changed?

557
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,230
What will you do now?

558
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,469
Jun Seo is gone.

559
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,570
You should appease me,

560
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,840
but you're sticking
right beside Jae Gyeong...

561
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,940
and telling him everything.

562
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:13,780
And now you're causing a rift
between me and Yoon Ho?

563
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Hey.

564
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,550
It's not me.

565
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,309
Don't lie.

566
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,289
You made the burner phone I gave Yoon Ho.

567
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,219
We're the only two
who can contact him with it.

568
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:29,659
Sang Eui.

569
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,300
Do you have something against me?

570
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,030
I have zero feelings for you.

571
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:41,300
While the others bullied you,
I did nothing at all.

572
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,639
So why would you do this to me?

573
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,639
Do you also think I killed Jun Seo?

574
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,449
And this is you avenging him?

575
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,179
Jun Seo said...

576
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,349
he'd only do it until
he'd made 500,000 dollars.

577
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,789
He said he'd quit
selling Lemon Mulberry once he had...

578
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:02,489
enough money to take Yoon Hee to the US,

579
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,730
but he couldn't.

580
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:07,000
Whose fault is that?

581
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,000
You're recording this, aren't you?

582
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,639
- What?
- Let's see it.

583
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,239
Give me your phone.

584
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,840
You cheeky thing.

585
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,809
Darn it.

586
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,750
Tae Jin.

587
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,650
Hey.

588
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,920
Tae Jin. I...

589
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,920
- You dirtbag.
- Sorry.

590
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,559
You'd record me?

591
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,800
Hey. Get up.

592
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,269
Stand up.

593
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:49,369
Sit down.

594
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,449
Park Jun Seo.

595
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,710
I didn't kill him, okay?

596
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:03,920
I don't know what you want to find out
by doing all this stupid stuff,

597
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,559
but if you do something like this again,

598
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,960
I'll make you pay dearly.

599
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,260
This is the last time I warn you verbally.

600
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,460
Sang Eui.

601
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,170
If we...

602
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,139
do our own thing well like we used to,

603
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,840
nothing will happen.

604
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,110
Okay?

605
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:26,409
Okay.

606
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,909
Let's eat.

607
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,849
I want to finish the meal.

608
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,159
What's this?

609
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,130
Have a look, and you'll remember.

610
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:03,909
Are you the Doctor?

611
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,550
What do you mean?

612
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,179
Did you make the Lemon Mulberry?

613
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

614
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,320
You and Lee Myung Guk.

615
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,590
You met often at Pilo-dong
outside work hours.

616
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,059
Youngryun Cold Storage.

617
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,889
That's the factory, right?

618
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:19,400
Did Lee Myung Guk make the drugs first...

619
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:20,900
and then you took over?

620
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,630
Darn it. Wait.

621
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,230
Jeong Sang Eui.

622
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,269
Jun Seo...

623
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
You said he wanted to take Yoon Hee
to the US to fix her...

624
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,670
and was going to make Lemon Mulberry
only until he had 500,000 dollars.

625
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,840
But he failed because of Tae Jin...

626
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,349
because he didn't share
his four digits to the password...

627
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:38,849
and Jun Seo couldn't withdraw the profits.

628
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:40,650
Aren't I right?

629
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:43,889
You two.

630
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,260
One is an officer,
and the other is a reporter,

631
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:48,460
But you act pretty much the same.

632
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,659
- What?
- You must be so frustrated.

633
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:57,099
Do you have a suspicion
but no actual proof? Is that it?

634
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,900
What are you doing?

635
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,239
What are you doing?

636
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,710
Fasten your seat belt if you want to know.

637
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:35,809
It's fine.

638
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,320
Hold your breath.
Don't inhale the cold air.

639
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:56,949
Lemon Mulberry is made here?

640
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,690
Yes.

641
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:09,829
What about Jong Soo?

642
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,969
Does he also know that you made
and sold Lemon Mulberry?

643
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,710
What would Jong Soo get into
the drug business for?

644
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,739
He can just take them
when he's having fun.

645
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:22,980
As you said,

646
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:26,179
Mr. Lee Myung Guk found
the drug's component.

647
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,750
And Jong Soo is still taking...

648
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,820
the drug that was
first developed from that.

649
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,090
But...

650
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,559
I made the Lemon Mulberry.

651
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,530
I mean, I did use Mr. Lee's recipe a bit.

652
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,570
So, why did you bring us here,

653
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,739
and why are you telling us this?

654
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:51,840
I was the one who got you hooked
on Lemon Mulberries.

655
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,579
Hey, Jeong Sang Eui.

656
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,750
Why?

657
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,150
Because I don't like you.

658
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:13,730
- Hey!
- Jae Gyeong!

659
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,769
- Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong!
- Why?

660
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,110
Let go.

661
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,429
(Keumhyung Group)

662
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:53,969
You worked hard.

663
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,969
I was so worried
whether you'd be able to do well.

664
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,039
But I underestimated my own son.

665
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,050
Mayor Joo In Sang just called.

666
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,989
He said he was persuaded by you.

667
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:14,789
Yes, Father.

668
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,530
Now, that seat...

669
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:20,329
is yours.

670
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:23,000
Don't be anxious anymore,

671
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,929
and be confident.

672
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,599
I've known...

673
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,739
that you've felt a sense of inferiority
compared to Tae Jin for a while.

674
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,309
Now, you don't have to feel that way.

675
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,650
Tae Jin, or whoever it may be,

676
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,380
has existed for you.

677
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,650
Those guys can be replaced by anyone,

678
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,690
but not you.

679
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,989
You're Won Chang Ho's son.

680
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
This position...

681
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,300
isn't something someone can have
just because they covet it.

682
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:00,699
Come here.

683
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:06,010
Sit here.

684
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:10,809
SIt.

685
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,590
Now,

686
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,690
once the licensing issue is
finally confirmed,

687
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:27,929
let's get you some treatment.

688
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,599
Pardon?

689
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,070
The future chairman of Keumhyung Group...

690
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:38,110
can't rely on drugs for too long.

691
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Yes, Father.

692
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,880
I'll hold onto this seat...

693
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,050
for just a little longer for you.

694
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,030
I want to rest now too.

695
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,530
So, hurry up with getting treated
and come back.

696
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,670
Yes.

697
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:11,340
I will, Father.

698
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,050
Prosecutor Park.

699
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,079
Congratulations on your new position.

700
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:24,949
- Pardon?
- Didn't you see?

701
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,420
The personnel appointment was just posted.

702
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,739
(Personnel Appointments, Park Tae Jin,
Ministry of Justice, Prosecution Bureau)

703
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,380
(Prosecutor Park Tae Jin)

704
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,699
Is there something like...

705
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,630
an antidote for Lemon Mulberry?

706
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:13,769
No.

707
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,210
Jae Gyeong. Stop.

708
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,179
I know you're angry. I do,

709
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,480
but what will you do to him now?

710
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:28,679
Were you also the one...

711
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,489
who kept sending packages
of drugs to Jae Gyeong?

712
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,190
- Yes.
- And what about 1882?

713
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,960
I thought only you and Jun Seo
knew about that, Jae Gyeong.

714
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,929
So, how did you find that out?

715
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,000
Twenty years ago,

716
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,539
I got beaten up by someone,

717
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:50,570
and Jun Seo told me
that it was an SOS signal.

718
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,010
He said to call Jae Gyeong
when things were urgent.

719
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,309
What did I ever do to you?

720
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,449
What did I do to you
that you got me addicted to drugs?

721
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,860
Stop smirking and answer me!

722
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:14,329
When we were in 12th grade...

723
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,170
before Jun Seo started hanging out
with you guys,

724
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:22,869
I was the only true friend Jun Seo had,
and he was the same to me.

725
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,280
But after hanging out with you guys
for a while,

726
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,309
he didn't even care about me.

727
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:33,019
Like that,
you guys took Jun Seo away from me.

728
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:35,849
So, I really hated you guys.

729
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,849
Hey, what are you talking about?

730
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,420
Who took what away from you?

731
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,920
We were all classmates.

732
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:44,059
Just hear me out.
It's not that long of a story.

733
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,099
Then, Chae Kyung Tae died,

734
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,969
and you transferred to another school,
Jae Gyeong.

735
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:52,969
Jun Seo.

736
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,010
And you, Yoon Jin,
split up with Jun Seo...

737
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,010
as the Audiophile clubroom got smashed.

738
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,809
For 20 years after that,
Jun Seo and I got along well.

739
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,110
We even got along well...

740
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,679
when Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Oh Chi Hyun, and Jeong Yoon Ho...

741
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,789
(Xinopharm)

742
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,559
ordered Jun Seo around,
used him, and looked down on him.

743
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
Good work.

744
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,159
We were just fine.

745
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,630
But these guys were taking things too far.

746
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:26,440
Delivering drugs wasn't enough.

747
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,699
Park Tae Jin even made Jun Seo
sell drugs too.

748
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,639
Let's stop now. I can't do this anymore.

749
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,480
Why are you doing this
when we've come this far?

750
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,679
If we just keep going,
you'll fix Yoon Hee's illness for sure...

751
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:38,550
and even live without worrying
about money your whole life.

752
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,019
Hey, so trust me, and let's keep going
for a few more months.

753
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,019
Whatever.

754
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:44,820
Let's stop now.

755
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,420
Pay me what I've made so far.

756
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,690
Park Jun Seo!

757
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,190
I said we should stop, you punk!

758
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,239
He even played around with Jun Seo's wife.

759
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:01,969
So what?

760
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,039
Darn it.

761
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:05,739
What does that have to do with
you getting me addicted?

762
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,610
Sure, as you said, after I transferred,

763
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,380
I didn't even talk to Jun Seo once.
So why would you do that to me?

764
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,980
You're the worst of them all!

765
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:20,260
Jun Seo went to see you ten times.

766
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,389
I told him not to.

767
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,590
I told him getting your forgiveness
was meaningless,

768
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,630
but he still went.

769
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:28,929
He went to see you
because he wanted your forgiveness.

770
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,300
Hey.

771
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,869
He even begged for your forgiveness...

772
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,570
the day before he died,
and what did you say?

773
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,570
- Sang Eui.
- You're not any better!

774
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,780
Did you listen to Jun Seo?

775
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,510
Did you?

776
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,750
He wasn't like himself,

777
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,880
but did you ask him why?

778
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,690
That fool.

779
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,690
He signed up for insurance...

780
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,559
thinking you two would be the ones
to dig the truth behind it...

781
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:58,730
if he ever died.

782
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,130
I was the one
who stuck around for 20 years,

783
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,170
so why you two?

784
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:07,570
Why?

785
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,409
Why were you two the most important
in his heart instead of me?

786
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,650
So?

787
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,250
Was that why you hired CEO Yoon
the night Jun Seo died...

788
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,219
to abduct me and get me addicted
to Lemon Mulberry...

789
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,889
before leaving me at exit 3-4
of Anhyun City Hall Station?

790
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,460
So that I would try
to investigate this case?

791
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,889
Jun Seo...

792
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,130
was so happy to hear
about your special promotion.

793
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,739
I thought,
"Sure, Jae Gyeong is so great,"

794
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:43,099
"he'll be able to avenge Jun Seo."

795
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:46,880
(From Doctor, 1882)

796
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,110
(Sending, Sent)

797
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,809
But I had no idea that great detective...

798
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:52,079
would lose to Gong Jin Wook
right off the bat.

799
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,280
He even took your gun.

800
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,280
So,

801
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,449
I meant for you to arrest Gong Jin Wook
and then find CEO Yoon through him.

802
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,960
Then, you'd find me, the Doctor,
and then Park Tae Jin.

803
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,929
That was my plan.

804
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,400
But it got off on the wrong foot
with Gong Jin Wook.

805
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,199
Then,

806
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:13,639
how did you know
about the security camera at the mill?

807
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,199
I told you. I didn't know about it.

808
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:17,809
So how much
of this are you responsible for?

809
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:24,210
Lee Myung Guk's corpse.

810
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,719
"Lee Myung Guk's corpse?"

811
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:29,050
Did you put it back in his home?

812
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,889
By yourself?

813
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,519
- With No Gyu Min.
- "No Gyu Min?"

814
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,590
No Gyu Min...

815
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,860
is the taxi driver who drove Jun Seo
to the construction site, isn't it?

816
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,599
Yes.

817
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,329
What does he have to do with this case?

818
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,599
Ask him yourself.
I'm sure you'll meet him soon.

819
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,840
What?

820
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,340
Manpyeong Port at 4:00 a.m.,
two days from now.

821
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,940
You can make a stop
in Boryeong before then.

822
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,539
Who's in Boryeong?

823
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,539
That grandma who is receiving the pension?

824
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:57,780
Go and ask yourself.

825
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,989
Why did you bring Lee Myung Guk's corpse
back to that house?

826
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:09,460
To make Jeong Yoon Ho take my bait.

827
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,530
Jang Jae Gyeong...

828
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,130
That would allow you
to arrest Jeong Yoon Ho,

829
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,769
followed by Oh Chi Hyun and Won Jong Soo.

830
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,909
I thought you'd figure out
who killed Jun Seo through it.

831
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:31,510
But Jae Gyeong, you're unpredictable.

832
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,110
You keep losing people.

833
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:34,719
Do you find this fun?

834
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,289
I'm sure you had fun.

835
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,659
You must've had fun manipulating me...

836
00:53:45,829 --> 00:53:48,130
after getting me addicted to drugs.

837
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,699
You said you did this
because we were bad and you hated us.

838
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,539
Then what about you?

839
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,340
How are you any better?

840
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,570
You were around Jun Seo for 20 years,
but what have you done?

841
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,440
He was suffering
under Won Jong Soo and Park Tae Jin,

842
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,610
but what did you do for him?

843
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,110
That's why I'm helping him now
by using you.

844
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,550
I'm helping Jun Seo get his revenge now.

845
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:12,889
Are you serious?

846
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,989
You're out of your mind.

847
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,000
Fine.

848
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,070
Let's see if you can speak that proudly
at the station too.

849
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,639
Park Tae Jin.

850
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,670
Are you sure you can arrest him?

851
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,380
Do you have
a single piece of evidence that proves...

852
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,010
Park Tae Jin killed Jun Seo
or that he sold drugs?

853
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,050
How are you so sure he killed Jun Seo?

854
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,679
Can't you see?
All clues are pointing to it.

855
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,889
Park Tae Jin stopped them
from going up to the ninth floor.

856
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:46,719
He was also the one who checked the body.

857
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,389
He did the postmortem examination...

858
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:50,929
and pushed to omit the autopsy
until the very end.

859
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,829
But you have no evidence.

860
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,800
He made sure to cut off any connection
between him and Jun Seo.

861
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,429
They never spoke about drugs on the phone,

862
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,500
and he handed over Gong Jin Wook
for Jun Seo to deal with.

863
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:04,869
This is the deal with the case.

864
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:09,179
Even if you dig further,
all you'll get is that I made the drugs...

865
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:11,280
and that Jun Seo sold them.

866
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:13,349
And?

867
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,320
What do you have?

868
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,219
Do you have proof
that Tae Jin killed Jun Seo?

869
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,329
I can help Park Tae Jin make
a mistake at least.

870
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,730
Hey.

871
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,800
Jang Jae Gyeong.

872
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,599
I won't run away.

873
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,340
I schemed everything.
I'll accept the punishment I deserve.

874
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,480
Arrest me!

875
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:44,250
But, not now.

876
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,050
You can't prove anything
if you arrest me now.

877
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,349
So please wait until then. Okay?

878
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,820
This was why I brought you here today!

879
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,320
I'll make sure that happens!

880
00:55:58,929 --> 00:55:59,929
That's how...

881
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,230
That's how I'll get my revenge.

882
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,579
Yoon Jin. Jae Gyeong.

883
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,280
I regret what I did.

884
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,190
I'm so sorry...

885
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,719
I made the drugs, Jae Gyeong.

886
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,090
Please give me a chance.

887
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:35,230
If you give me some time,
I'll get Park Tae Jin for you.

888
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,869
Jang Jae Gyeong!

889
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:46,170
Let's go home.

890
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,409
Send some gifts
to Mayor Joo In Sang's house.

891
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,949
Nice oysters from Tongyeong would be good.

892
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,619
- Make sure to add a thank-you card.
- Okay.

893
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:59,389
The chairman's leaving right now.

894
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:02,119
It'll only take a moment. Is he inside?

895
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,500
(Chairman's Office)

896
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,099
You can come along.

897
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,710
I know what you want to say...

898
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,110
but just follow my orders.

899
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:26,980
I don't like it.

900
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:31,849
I don't like being a prosecutor.
I never liked being one.

901
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,760
I don't want to live a single day
as a prosecutor.

902
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,460
Despite that,

903
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,159
I kept my place...

904
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,460
just as you wished.

905
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,869
I wanted to become a businessman.

906
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:48,869
I thought that suited me better.

907
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,570
I've been serving you from a young age,

908
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:54,079
and I know Jong Soo well.

909
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,880
I believe I know what's best
for Keumhyung Group's future.

910
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,449
That's why I would like to work...

911
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,420
as a part of the company.

912
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,250
Same with the Pilo-dong project.

913
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,219
I planned, polished, and edited it.

914
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,489
That was why...

915
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,090
it got to where it is.

916
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:17,530
Please have my transfer appointment...

917
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,599
to Gwacheon's
Prosecution Bureau withdrawn.

918
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,139
Also, please allow me...

919
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,139
to see to the end of this project.

920
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,309
If you would do that for me,

921
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,909
I'll make sure to build the future
of Keumhyung Group you...

922
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:31,880
- and Jong Soo dream of.
- How?

923
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,920
How are you going to do that?

924
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,619
- Well...
- You were a drug dealer.

925
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,719
How can you plan and construct
the future of Keumhyung Group?

926
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,289
Chairman.

927
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,429
The biggest risk this project has
isn't Joo In Sang or Jong Soo.

928
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:50,599
It's you.

929
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,639
When I first heard you were selling drugs,

930
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:58,909
I thought it would be temporary.

931
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:00,409
Why?

932
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:05,710
Because you're someone
who believes you're smart.

933
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,480
Didn't we talk enough
at the soup place last time?

934
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,190
I hoped you would've got my message.

935
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:12,650
But what is this now?

936
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,690
Our company's fate depends
on the Pilo-dong project.

937
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:19,760
Yet you want
to bring in those filthy hands...

938
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,530
you used to sell drugs with?

939
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,400
How do you...

940
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:25,570
No, let me ask this first.

941
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:29,440
Why did you work with Park Jun Seo...

942
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,010
behind Jong Soo's back to make money?

943
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,510
Are you repaying my kindness with hatred?

944
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,510
Do you really not know?

945
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,550
Fine.

946
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:48,190
You're right.
I worked with Jun Seo to sell drugs...

947
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,960
so I could secure investment funds.

948
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,690
Is that so wrong?

949
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:58,630
You forced companies
to go out of business...

950
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,570
and bought them for next to nothing
to make the Keumhyung Group today.

951
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,510
In the process,
you made eight people commit suicide.

952
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,880
Tell me.

953
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:12,250
Can you say
that the money you earned this way...

954
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,250
is truly cleaner than the money I earned
from selling drugs?

955
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,889
Would adding some of my money taint...

956
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,190
the company more than it already is?

957
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,030
All you merely had were ten cows.

958
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:32,469
Your family couldn't even afford
to feed them.

959
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:34,070
I took their only son...

960
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,369
and poured my money into him
to turn him into a human.

961
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:39,769
But what is this?

962
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,639
What a work of art you've become.

963
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:05,070
Is Sang Eui telling the truth?

964
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,900
Is it okay to leave him like this?

965
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,440
If I arrest him now,

966
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:13,940
I'll be able to prove that he made drugs
and that Jun Seo sold them.

967
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,079
Park Tae Jin, that jerk.

968
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:19,710
What can we do to make him confess?

969
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,380
The case will face limits
if left as a narcotics case.

970
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,420
I won't be able to uncover
who sits above Park Jun Seo.

971
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,960
It'll only support their case
that Jun Seo committed suicide.

972
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:31,159
That selling drugs led him
to kill himself?

973
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,800
So what can we do?

974
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:40,000
Sang Eui is psychotic.
Are we going to trust him and wait?

975
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,110
He drugged you for his revenge.

976
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,070
He's out of his mind.

977
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:57,420
Tell Sang Eui to bring me some new drugs.

978
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,349
I don't want the usual stuff
on a day like today.

979
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:03,059
Come on, what's with the face?

980
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,260
Today will be the last.

981
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:09,929
I'm going to the US next month
to get treatment.

982
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,599
Don't be so shocked.

983
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,099
Anyway, that's the plan.

984
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,539
Let me just enjoy it tonight.

985
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:20,409
All right.

986
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:21,539
Tell him to hurry.

987
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
Hey, Sang Eui.

988
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:38,460
Can you bring some drugs
to the Lorraine Hotel?

989
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:42,000
Would 30 minutes be enough?

990
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:45,429
Okay.

991
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,909
(I spotted Jeong Sang Eui leaving
with a man and a woman after...)

992
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,480
(Park Sang Jin, Secretary's Office)

993
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,030
(Anhyeon Police Station)

994
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,610
Captain Jang.

995
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,980
We found...

996
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:32,610
Jeong Yoon Ho.

997
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,380
Where?

998
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,730
(Connection)

999
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,769
(Connection)

1000
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,710
I can't read him anymore.

1001
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,139
It's not for sure yet.

1002
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:34,309
What's going on?

1003
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:36,679
Did you sell drugs behind my back?

1004
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:39,110
This is why hierarchy is important!

1005
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:41,380
That money! No one can get it out.

1006
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,949
Park Tae Jin is finally on the move.

1007
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:46,590
We'll seize
and search Youngryun Cold Storage.

1008
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,820
Let's head inside.

1009
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,659
I was asked to pass this over...

1010
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:52,989
if you two ever came.

1011
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,860
What's on it?

1012
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,460
Gong Jin Wook.

1013
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,440
It wasn't your first time
meeting CEO Yoon, was it?

1014
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,670
What's wrong with all of you?

1015
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:05,909
Take a good look at what you've done.

1016
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,809
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
