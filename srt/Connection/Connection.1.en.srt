(All characters, organizations,

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,209
Drug-related crimes are on the rise,

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,679
and the government declares
a war against drugs.

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,119
Grand-scale crackdowns have been
in the works since last year,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,890
but drug activity has only been spreading
from Seoul and its surroundings.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,289
This morning in Anhyun,

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,429
a woman in her 30s was found driving
after using drugs...

8
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,859
and was arrested.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,660
These are the drugs confiscated
within Anhyun in the last month.

10
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,129
It's worth 20 million dollars,

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,969
and the amount is enough
for 20,000 people to use at once.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,539
Anhyun is the first
out of local self-governments...

13
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,740
claiming to advocate a drug-free city.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,009
They held a ceremony
to declare a war against drugs.

15
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,649
We'll eradicate all drug organizations
in Anhyun...

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,219
so they never set foot in our city again.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
There they are!

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,700
Freeze!

19
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,929
We're from the police!

20
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,969
Don't move.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,000
Stop right there.

22
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:08,840
Hey, arrest every one of them.

00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,780
- What is this?
- How about a song?

24
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,549
At Anhyun Nightclub, we apprehended...

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,019
the Five Spider Gang's dealer.

26
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,489
Next, we'll go after the treasurer.

27
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,269
The drugs! Get the drugs!

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,540

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,540
Run!

30
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:52,349
Darn it.

31
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,530
They got shut down.

32
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,290
Good job.

36

- Keep still!
- Let go of me!

- Two.
- Okay.

- Is it the collagen?
- What?

75

Gosh, I give up.

188
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,440
I give up. You won.

189
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Darn it.

190
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,639
Look, my hands are empty.

191
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,009
You can't hit me, all right?

192
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,409
Okay?

193
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,980
Hey.

194
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,220
Take me in.

195
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,549
I'm cold, okay?

196
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,289
Out of the way!

197
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,860
Myung Ho.

198
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,159
Don't do it.

199
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,200
Jang Chul Gu. Don't do it.

200
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,240
Myung Ho!

201
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,309
Myung Ho!

202
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,850
(1 month later)

203
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,549
Please state your department and rank.

204
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,820
Anhyun Police Station, Criminal Affairs
Division Two, Narcotics Unit.

205
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,129
Lieutenant Jang Jae Kyung.

206
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,600
This investigation is to hear
from the officer involved...

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,169
in the possible misuse of firearms
on the night of January 22, 2024,

208
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,399
when apprehending Jang Chul Gu,
who was wanted...

209
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,899
as the head of the Five Spider Gang,

210
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,870
a drug cartel active in
southern Gyeonggi Province,

211
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,309
on the rooftop of Sujeong Motel
in downtown Anhyun.

212
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,809
Please describe the situation
on the rooftop at the time.

213
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,750
In the report by your partner,
Sergeant Kim Chang Soo,

214
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,620
he stated that he heard gunshots
before he arrived at the scene.

215
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,750
So, the only statement regarding
what happened on the rooftop...

216
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,549
is from you, Lieutenant Jang.

217
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,620
But Mr. Jang Chul Gu,
the man who was shot, says otherwise.

218
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,529
I stand by what I said
in the statement I submitted beforehand...

219
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,029
and what is stated in the analysis report.

220
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,700
Jang Chul Gu was shot
in the left Achilles tendon.

221
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,129
The analysis report states that
he was shot from quite a close distance.

222
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,639
Is that correct?

223
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,139
Yes.

224
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,240
I will get straight to the point.

225
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,539
Approximately one month prior
to Jang Chul Gu's arrest,

226
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,809
on December 11 of last year,

227
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,250
Sergeant An Myung Ho's Achilles tendon
was severely injured...

228
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,850
while trying to apprehend the suspect,
ending up with a severed Achilles tendon.

229
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,620
I heard you were quite fond of him
as a junior officer.

230
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,620
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

231
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,789
Was it perhaps something like that?

232
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,629
Take me in.

233
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,710
Act on the Performance of Duties
by Police Officers, Article 10-2.

234
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,779
To arrest an offender in action
or one who commits a crime punishable...

235
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,549
by imprisonment with or without labor
for a maximum of at least three years,

236
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:15,820
a police officer may use a firearm.

237
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,519
I shot two blanks as per regulations,

238
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,230
and in a situation where the offender was
charging with a weapon in hand,

239
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,490
I shot one round of live ammunition
to the lower extremities.

240
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,100
I did not aim
for any particular body part,

241
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,429
and I was in no situation to do so.

242
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,200
That is all.

243
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,909

(Special Promotion Ceremony
of Inspector Jang Jae Kyung)

246
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,720
Good work, sir.

247
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:53,889
(Certificate of Appointment)

248
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,129
- Hey.
- Jang Jae Kyung.

249
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,259
Inspector, congratulations
on your special promotion.

250
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,870
- Congratulations.
- It's all thanks to you.

251
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,169
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

252
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,899
Looking good.

253
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,610
I got some good rest, sir.

254
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,009
I'm starting physical therapy next week.

255
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm glad to hear it.

256
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,750
Taking too long of a break
will become a habit.

257
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,610
Congratulations
on your special promotion, sir.

258
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,019
Thank you.

259
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,419
Also,

260
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,720
thank you.

261
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
See you back at work soon.

262
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,059
(Oh Soo Hyun, Kim Chang Soo)

263
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,460
Gosh, these guys.

264
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,429
You're making me feel all ticklish
on the inside on such a nice day.

265
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,399
How much did you get as a special bonus?

266
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,970
It's enough to buy us some beef, right?

267
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,509
I haven't checked,
but it should be enough, right?

268
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,669
How nice.

269
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,740
You should at least buy him some beef
as you say something like that...

270
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,350
for our dear Myung Ho to feel like,

271
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,610
"I should really get back to work soon."

272
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,649
You only like to sound cool. Ridiculous.

273
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,850
I know this place...

274
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,759
that slaughters a whole cow
with a single phone call.

275
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,820
Shall I call them now?

276
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,759
Sounds good. Let's go, then.

277
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,730
- Chief! Here comes the chief.
- Hey.

278
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,400
Congratulations, Inspector Jang.

279
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,869
Thank you for coming
when you must be busy.

280
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,269
Gosh, don't say that.

281
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,599
Jang Jae Kyung is
getting a special promotion.

282
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,670
Of course, I should come.

283
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,170
Gosh, of course.

284
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,009
If it hadn't been
for Inspector Jang Jae Kyung,

285
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,710
what reason would
the Police Commissioner have...

286
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,539
for patting our chief on the shoulders?

287
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,980
Where was it? Right here?

288
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,779
- Here?
- Hey, don't touch.

289
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,819
How dare you try to dirty up
the spot the Commissioner touched?

290
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,049
Well, why not just have
your uniform preserved...

291
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,319
and hang it up somewhere?

292
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,220
That's enough joking around.

293
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,130
Anyway, our Narcotics Unit is
the pride of Anhyun Station.

294
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,890
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir.

295
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,259
I'll put together a nice dinner
sometime soon.

296
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,700
Let's feast on some meat!

297
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,339
- Why don't we take a picture?
- Yes, let's do that.

298
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,339
Hey, Yoo Kyung Hwan!

299
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,970
Come and take a picture for us.

300
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,769
- Hey, Inspector Yoo.
- Yes, Chief.

301
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,809
Please.

302
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,450
Here. Come this way.

303
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,980
I'm an inspector now too.

304
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:57,849
You can speak casually now.

305
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,950
On the count of three,

306
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,019
how about
"Go, Inspector Jang Jae Kyung?"

307
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
- Nice.
- All right.

308
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,420
One, two, three.

309
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,289
- Go, Inspector Jang Jae Kyung!
- Go, Inspector Jang Jae Kyung!

310
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,630
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

in person earlier?

Congratulations on the special promotion.

327
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,930
I saw it in the papers.

328
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,529
You started as a constable
and made it all the way to an inspector.

329
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,740
I hear that's not an easy feat.

330

to see you...

334

before it was too late.

335
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,349

I don't understand how you can be
even more late than that.

339
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,109
If it's about that again, please leave.

340
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,039
Yes, you're right.

all these years.

344
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,750
I should've listened to you then.

345
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,460
Things would be different...

346
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,920
between us if I had.

347
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,099
I'm sorry, Jae Kyung.

348
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:07,829
Back then,

349
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:11,170
I was foolish.

350
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,470
I was a coward too.

351
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,509
So if it's not too late...

352
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,480
You're right.

353
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,740
You were foolish and cowardly.

354
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,910
On top of that,
you were blinded by greed.

355
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,480
- Jae Kyung.
- I understand.

356
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,579
I saw countless people like you
while working in this field.

357
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,589
Foolish, cowardly, and greedy.

358
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,589
- Jae Kyung...
- But they all served their time.

359
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,789
What about you?

360
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,829
Aren't you still hanging around

361

00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,430
Does it still bother you?

364
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,009
If you're asking for forgiveness
so that you can get peace of mind,

365
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,579
I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

366
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,890
Consider it your sentence.

367
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,809
I know I'm late.

368
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,579
However,

369
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm going to keep trying.

370
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,480
I came to tell you that.

371
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,119
I'll put everything back in order.

372
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:41,089
I'll get going.

373
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,710
Are you Jang Jae Kyung?

374
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,309
Yes.

375
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,450
Is everything
on your police report true?

376
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,519
Did you witness it yourself?

377
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,180
(Jang Jae Kyung)

378
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,549
(Park Jun Seo)

379
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,890
Jun Seo.

380
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,759
You saw it. You should tell him.

381
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:15,089
Your report says...

382
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,630
Park Jun Seo witnessed it on-site.

383
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,930
Did you really witness it?

384
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:25,940
That's not true.

385
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,039
I didn't witness anything.

386
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,910
- Jun Seo.
- I...

387
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,450
didn't see anything.

388
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,779
Park Jun Seo.

389
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,579
Aren't we friends?
Why are you hiding it from me?

390
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,589
It's not true!

391
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:54,630
(I love Mom. I like Mom.
Mom is the best.)

392
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,109
Come on, I'm almost done.

393
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,450
Seriously...

394
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,880
(Kim Woo Sung)

395
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,789
They can't even prioritize the stories
in the right order.

396
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,490
They don't deserve their paychecks.

397
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,589
I'm almost done,

398
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,990
so tell them to keep their mouths shut
and stop badgering me.

399
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,730
They told you to return.

400
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,630
Why?

401
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,599
I don't know the reason.
They just asked you to return.

402
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:33,569
Well...

403
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,809
They told me
they couldn't stand the sight of me...

404
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,009
and told me to assist
with editorial at home.

405
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
What's the reason?

406
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,049
Are they having trouble selling ads
now that I'm not around?

407
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,049
The director met with Doseong Chemicals
and the head of PR...

408
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,319
and sorted everything out.

409
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,319
He said you should return to your post.

410
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,890
I can't bear to hear all the flattery
from him.

411
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,329
Okay.

412
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,400
Let him know I'll be in soon.

413
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Yes!

414
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,710
Yes.

415
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,769
Okay. Hold on.

416
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,710
I saw on the news
that it snowed a lot in Toronto.

417
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,650
I heard all the schools closed.

418
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,380
Did Ye Eun go to kindergarten?

419
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,849
What is she doing right now?

420
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,049
Is she sleeping already?

421
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

422
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,799
- Mom!
- Hi, Honey.

423
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,859
Come here.

424
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,259
Bye!

425
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,329
I'll get going.

426
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,400
Take care.

427
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Bye!

428
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,599
Take care.

429
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,869
- Bye!
- Bye.

430
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,009
- Mom!
- Yes?

431
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:46,309
I'll be going now.

432
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:47,710
- Take care.
- Bye.

433
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,779
I got it. Please stop scolding me
about child support.

434
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,480
You didn't keep all the promises
you made when we divorced either.

435
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,059
Ye Eun looked like she lost weight
in the last photo you sent.

436
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,220
I know you're feeding her burgers...

437
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,130
and heated-up frozen pizza
because you're tight on time.

438
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,329
Keep that up and I'll...

439
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,029
Excuse me!

440
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,640
Darn it.

441
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,069
Hello?

442
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:18,609
Hello?

443
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:25,349
Excuse me.

444
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,779
Look.

445
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,720
My screen shattered thanks to you.
What are you going to do?

446
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,789
Are you serious?

447
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Hey, lady.

448
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,599
What is that?

449
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,299
Hey, lady...

450
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,180
Mom.

451
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:04,789
What?

452
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,519
Are you all right?

453
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Hey!

454
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,089
Your phone's screen was damaged,

455
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,660
so you followed her with the aim...

456
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,589
of getting compensation.

457
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:45,200
Detective.

458
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,359
Yes?

459
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,900
Was that an illegal drug?

460
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:51,900
Is it a new type of drug?

461
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,470
Well...

462
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,839
We're still investigating.

463
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:57,569
I see.

464
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,210
It must be a new type...

465
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:05,180
if a narcotics detective
couldn't identify it right away.

466
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,150
It has to be a new kind.

467
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,319
It must be really strong.

468
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,319
She took it the moment she got it.

469
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:30,539
Here.

470
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,539
Her name is Yoo Young Mi.

471
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,150
She's 36 years old and a homemaker.

472
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,950
She was out to greet her daughter
for a kindergarten drop-off...

473
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,349
when she got the drug delivered
and consumed it right away.

474
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,549
She ran after being witnessed...

475
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,289
and was hit by a delivery truck
where she died on the spot.

476
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,619
Did you inquire about the drug components?

477
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,960
Soo Hyun just put in the request.

478
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,319
What is this now?

479
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,960
There's no end.

480
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,500
That woman looks familiar.

481
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,059
- Yes?
- Come out for a minute.

482
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,400
Captain,
doesn't that woman look familiar to you?

483
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,109
Where did I see her?

484
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:05,809
- Yes, Captain?
- Hey.

485
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,279
The witness is a reporter
for the Anhyun Economic Daily.

486
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,710
- Take caution.
- Right, pork head meat.

487
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,880
Don't answer everything she asks...

488
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,119
or she'll write a story
with your name on it.

489
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,519
Yes, sir. I'll be careful.

490
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,420
- Let's go to the site. We'll be back.
- Okay.

491
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,990
All right. Hey.

492
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,490
Don't forget our appointment later.

493
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:23,059
Yes, sir.

494
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,599
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

495
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,170
Why are you so late?

496
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,269
Didn't I call you hours ago?

497
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,269
I have my reasons.

498
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,839
- Follow me.
- Okay.

499
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,210
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

500
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,579
Oh Yoon Jin, are you out of your mind?

501
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,710
Do you know what time it is?

502
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,710
Hold on.

503
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:48,180
I already know what you want to say.

504
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,589
I promise to listen to your story...

505
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:52,420
about how you brought me back later.

506
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:53,789
For now,

507
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,630
please listen to what I have to say.

508
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,069
I think...

509
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,269
I was born to be a reporter.

510
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Today...

511
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,539
I don't know how they knew
this was my first day back after a month,

512
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,779
but someone took drugs
right before my eyes and then died.

513
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,049
It's something new
that the police have no info on.

514
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,819
It's as if someone we can't see...

515
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,990
is feeding me an exclusive.

516
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,299
Gosh, this sound.

517
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:36,400
It sounds nothing like pork, right?

518
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let me pour you one.

519
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,569
Are you sure this was slaughtered today?

520
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,069
It doesn't taste good
on the day of slaughter.

521
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,369
It needs to rest a while.

522
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:43,670
You said it would be slaughtered today.

523
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,509
Why do you take every word at face value?

524
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,710
"Slaughtered today"
was a figure of speech.

525
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,049
Can you even investigate properly?

526
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:54,980
Do you investigate properly?

527
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,890
- Water for Myung Ho.
- Thanks.

528
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,589
Fill your glasses.

529
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,190
Let's toast.

530
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,130
Let's celebrate
Jae Kyung's promotion to inspector!

531
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,329
And wish Myung Ho a speedy return!

- Cheers!
- Cheers!

533
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,269
Down that, Myung Ho.

534
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,269
- Down your water.
- Bottoms up.

535
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,569
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

548
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,259

549
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,960
What about round two?

550
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,130
- You, punk.
- Round two.

551
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,700
Get back home early.

552
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,940
Oh Soo Hyun,

Yes, what about you, Captain?

642

No, I missed him. Who was that woman?

643
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,119
I think she's a cash carrier.

644
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,349
She claims it was a part-time gig
to make 300 dollars...

645

in return for taking a backpack
and putting it in a public locker.

And the Jeonghoon 3-dong police substation
just called...

647

to say that they retrieved
the drugs that fell on the street.

for you to hurry back.

650

All right. Get a statement from her
and wait for me.

- Hi.

Yes.

00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,500
I reside in Building 102, Unit 315.

686
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,840
You know the person who died in
a car accident out front a few days ago?

687
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,179
I heard it was someone in my building.

688
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,449
Do you know which unit?

689
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,650
I was told not to say.

690

What, did the police tell you that?

691
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,320
Well, not the police, but...

692
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,090
The resident representative said so.

693
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,190
The resident representative?

694
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,929
My gosh, seriously?

695
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:47,360
The resident rep doesn't have the right
to boss you around.

696
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,800
A resident rep isn't the president.
You know what I mean?

697
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,800
My goodness.

698
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,800
Here, you should drink this
while it's warm.

699
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,469
Goodness, you didn't have to.

700
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:01,610
So?

701
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,980
Come on, which unit?

702
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:05,750
I heard it was Unit 215.

703
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,349
It's the unit right below mine.

704
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,150
This is why they say...

705
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,860
you don't even know if a neighbor dies
in an apartment, right?

706
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,860
That's right.

707
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,059
But...

708
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,130
do you know the family pretty well?

709
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:23,530
Goodness.

710
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,000
Just a moment.

711
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,639
Hey, Si Jung. It's been a while.

712
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,340
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.

713
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,150
What?

714
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,250
Who died?

715
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:00,500
That man took your gun.

716
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,409
I have no signs of hallucinations.

717
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,820
It's nauseating, and I'm dizzy.

718
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:17,519
My hands are shaking.

719
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,719
Is this an adverse reaction to the drug?

720
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,289
Who could it be?

721
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,630
Who did this to me?

722
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,940
Jang Chul Gu...

723
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,710
Yes, it has to be Jang Chul Gu.

724
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,610
He's trying to avenge me.

00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:42,639
"One, eight, eight, two."

727
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,949
"One, eight, eight, two."
What about Park Jun Seo?

728
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,400
(Jang Jae Kyung)

729
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:23,079
No one can find out for now.

730
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,190
Not yet. No one can find out...

731
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,449
- Where's Inspector Jang?
- He'll be here soon.

732
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,849
So why did you go to that place?

733
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:00,489
Captain Jang sent me
a text late last night.

734
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:01,489
Here.

735
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,760
(Meet me at car exit 3-4 at 7:20 a.m.
at Anhyun City Hall Station.)

736
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
Who is this "Doctor?"

737
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,500
Captain Jang doesn't seem to know either.

738
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,860
What does "1882" mean?

739
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,460
I'm not sure about that either.

740
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,429
So what do you know?

741
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:17,909
(Interrogation Room)

742
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,239
- Inspector Jang.
- Here he is.

743
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,139
What's with your face?

744
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,940
What happened to your arm?

745
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:24,550
Did you find out anything else?

746
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,079
No, I've already informed you
of all the findings.

747
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,219
But someone must have ordered
the bag to be placed in the locker.

748
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:29,420
We could come up
with a facial composite at least.

749
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,489
We're waiting
for the forensic sketch artist to arrive.

750
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,320
Who is the informant?

751
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:38,389
What does "Doctor" mean,
and what is this "1882?"

752
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm not sure yet.

753
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,000
I just texted you a phone number.

754
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,400
Look it up and let me know
when you find out who it is.

755
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,400
I will.

756
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,869
Also, Five Spider Gang's Jang Chul Gu.

757
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,139
Which hospital is he at?

758
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,500
He's on the third floor
of the Sunkwang General Hospital.

759
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,550
What should I do with this?

760
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,920
- Did you get all the fingerprints?
- I did.

761
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,590
Keep it for now.

762
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:11,730
I was shocked.

763
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,960
Why?

764
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,500
I've never seen a prosecutor move so fast
to conduct an autopsy.

765
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,099
So is it a problem
even when prosecutors work fast?

766
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,599
You know how it is.

767
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,340
In most cases,
they send new prosecutors...

768
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,769
for the autopsy.

769
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,980
A deputy chief prosecutor ran over
as soon as we called.

770
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,480
I know the deputy chief prosecutor well.

771
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,050
Do you?

772
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,710
They're a good person
who is good at their job.

773
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,750
What?

774
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,519
- What is it?
- This phone isn't locked.

775
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:38,150
I can open it right away.

776
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,389
That's good.

777
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,519
Hey.

778
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,260
Inspector Jang.

779
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:47,659
Congratulations on your special promotion.

780
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:50,699
We have the same ranking now, don't we?

781
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:55,500
The inspection team dropped by, right?
Is everything sorted out?

782
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,210
(Park Jun Seo)

783
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,079
Yes.

784
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,380
What?

785
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,880
What is it?

786
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,449
(Jang Jae Kyung)

787
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:10,889
What is this? Pick it up.

788
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,119
- Park Jun Seo.
- Hello?

789
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,159
Where are you right now?

790
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,059
Park Jun Seo!

791
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,059
Jun Seo!

792
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,530
Captain Jang.

793
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,050
He fell from a construction site
in Pilo-dong and passed away.

794
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:46,190
The estimated time of death...

795
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,059
is between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:00 a.m. last Friday.

796
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,110
Hey.

797
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,420
Please take me
to Sunkwang General Hospital.

798
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,730
Sunkwang General Hospital...

799
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:30,969
No...

800
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,599
Our SOS. Do you remember it?

801
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,940
One, eight, eight, two.

802
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,110
Captain.

803
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,079
No.

804
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:25,019
They must not find
any narcotics in my blood.

805
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,559
Take care.

806
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,210
(Sunkwang General Hospital)

807
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,460
Did you eat?

808
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,860
I did. Did you?

809
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:18,869
I'm here.

810
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,179
(Medical Area A)

811
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:42,230
I'm sorry,
but patients aren't allowed in here.

812
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:44,929
Are you all right?

813
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:48,670
Excuse me, please open the door.

814
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:52,510
Excuse me? Sir?

815
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,579
Open the door.

816
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,010
Excuse me, please open the door.

817
00:57:56,949 --> 00:57:57,949
I must find it.

818
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:00,480
I have to find my blood.

819
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:03,179
Hello?

820
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,519
(Jang Jae Kyung, 36)

821
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:13,059
(Jang Jae Kyung, 36)

822
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:19,500
Excuse me.

823
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,440
Please open the door!

824
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,469
Gosh.

825
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:28,239
Please open this door.

826
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,380
Hello?

827
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,880
- Is it locked?
- Yes.

828
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,480
Please open the door.

829
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:38,320
Tell them to hurry over.

830
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,019
Excuse me!

831
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:44,659
Hello?

832
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:46,559
Please hurry up and open it.

833
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,329
Sir, please open this door.

834
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,869
If you don't open this door,
we'll call the police.

835
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,050
(Don't try so hard. Take your pill,
and I'll see you soon. From Doctor)

836
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,079
(Jang Jae Kyung)

837
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,480
You should be more careful from now on.

838
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,550
I must get through this.

839
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,190
He fell from a construction site
in Pilo-dong and passed away.

840
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,059
I came to tell you that.

841
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,989
I'll put everything back in order.

842
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:19,989
Sir?

843
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,000
I can do it.

844
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:23,829
We'll call the police.

845
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:26,269
Hello?

846
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,780
Open the door!

847
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,579
Here's the key.

848
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,739
(Connection)

849
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,809
(March, 2005)

850
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,369
"Classroom. 1882"

851
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,480
(Jang Jae Kyung)

852
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,090
Hey, what is it? Why did you call me?

853
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:23,760
How did you get here so fast?

854
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,230
It only took you three minutes.

855
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,130
Park Jun Seo.

856
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,429
I told you not to use 1882 all the time.

857
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:32,800
- Hey.
- You...

858
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:35,300
How are you so strong?

859
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:36,739
You're going to get it.

860
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,110
What are you listening to
when I'm right here?

861
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:47,349
What did you say?

862
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:49,219
I said, what are you listening to?

863
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,050
Do you want to listen to it too?

864
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,050
No, thanks.

865
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,519
It would make me cringe.

866
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,630
We're getting a transfer student tomorrow.

867
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,059
I don't care.

868
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:02,559
I went to the faculty office earlier...

869
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,269
and saw her picture
on our teacher's desk.

870
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,969
She's from Seoul, and she's pretty.

871
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,510
You'd love anyone from Seoul.

872
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:49,269
(Connection)

873
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,010
Do all friends have to be helpful?

874
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,610
Is that what you think too?

875
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:55,539
That detective looked like
he was addicted to drugs.

876
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,550
I'm not a drug addict.

877
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,210
I'm an inspector who catches them.

878
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,619
Who abducted me...

879
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:01,619
and drugged me?

880
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:02,619
The postmortem examination
was already done.

881
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:04,349
He must be in the morgue
of Anhyun University Hospital.

882
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:05,349
We need to conduct an autopsy.

883
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:07,420
Several things are suspicious
about Jun Seo's death.

884
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,460
It's you, Jae Kyung. Long time no see.

885
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,389
The people Jun Seo talked to
before he died...

886
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,099
Hey!

887
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,360
Those guys practically lived together...

888
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,699
with Jun Seo for the last 20 years.

889
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:20,230
I'm asking what you talked about
with Jun Seo the day before he died.

890
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,239
Just give it to me.

891
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:22,599
I'm Park Jun Seo's friend.

892
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,570
He left a will before he passed.

893
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,070
Get him!

894
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,110
I know you killed Park Jun Seo.

895
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,179
This is your last warning.
