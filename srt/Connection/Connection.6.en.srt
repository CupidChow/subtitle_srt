1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,309
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,949
What time did he go in?

3
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,150
Hasn't it been over 30 minutes?

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,489
It has.

5
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,429
Hey.

6
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:25,929
What?

7
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,439
How do you know the passcode
to their place?

8
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,180
I know what you're thinking.

9
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,620
I told him.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,689
I rushed to the hospital
when I heard of Jun Seo's news.

11
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,760
Prosecutor Park wanted to double-check
although it was a suicide,

12
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,829
so he asked to drop by...

13
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,060
and look through our laptop
or any memos...

14
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,469
Ji Yeon,

15
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,700
I told you to change the passcode.

16
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,469
I tried it just in case,
and you haven't changed it.

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,579
If you don't know how to change it,
shall I do it for you?

18
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,980
No. I'll change it myself.

19
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,579
Okay.

20
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,780
You took a look at Jun Seo's laptop?

21
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,890
Why?

22
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,459
I wanted to see if anything indicated
something other than suicide.

23
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,560
He could've left a suicide note.

24
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,560
And rather than
have detectives come and go,

25
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,729
Ji Yeon said she'd prefer it
if I came by as a friend.

26
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,969
Why are you here at this hour?

27
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,569
What do you mean "this hour?"

28
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,939
A civil servant
usually gets off work at this hour.

29
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,680
It's not a special timeframe.

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,650
Why are you here?

31
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,949
Ji Yeon wanted to know
how the investigation would proceed.

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,319
I'd said I'd visit when I could.

33
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,389
And I chose to come today.

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Okay?

35
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,189
What about you?

36
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,090
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I'll go now.

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,460
Okay.

39
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,840
Step aside.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why did you come here?

41
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,199
Step aside.

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,250
Mr. Park.

43
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm sorry to say this when you came by.

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,580
It's a bit late, and I'm tired.

45
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,889
I'll meet you near your office one day.

46
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:02,419
That would be better, right?

47
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,789
Call me when you're free to come by.

48
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,090
I'll leave you, then.

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,389
Bye.

50
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,500
(Connection)

51
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,610
What did you come to ask her?

52
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,610
How is the investigation proceeding?

53
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,909
What?

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,750
You called it a suicide.

55
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,889
I'm wondering what investigation
there could possibly be...

56
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,759
for you to come and explain.

57
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,490
We did an autopsy,

58
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,659
and Ji Yeon was concerned too.

59
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,310
(Episode 6)

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,580
They're coming out.

61
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,910
What's going on?

62
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,319
Did Jang Jae Gyeong not catch on?

63
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,750
It looks like it.

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,420
He's so slow.

65
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,189
Isn't it obvious what it is
if a man visits a woman...

66
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:46,220
after sundown?

67
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,589
Inspector Jang arrived after sundown too.

68
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,829
Darn you.

69
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,569
- Hey.
- What?

70
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,339
Where is she going?

71
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,379
Look.

72
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,750
Hey.

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
- Follow her.
- Okay.

74
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,540
- Take care.
- Thanks.

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,449
(Every second counts for the informant.)

76
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,949
Hello.

77
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,790
Everyone went out?

78
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,290
Yes, to have dinner.

79
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,470
Did you look into CEO Yoon?

80
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,870
Yes, but I didn't find much.

81
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,839
Where did you go
and what did you look into?

82
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,610
I asked the meth dealers I knew.

83
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,250
But no one had heard of CEO Yoon.

84
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,180
It's possible the person changes names.

85
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,120
Dealers tend to do that.

86
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,990
Is that it?

87
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,350
I'll ask around some more.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Captain.

89
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,290
Did I do something to upset you?

90
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,259
You've been treating me differently.

91
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,069
I tried to think of a reason,

92
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,639
but I couldn't come up with one.

93
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,509
The night Lee Myung Guk's house
burned down.

94
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,720
You returned to the station
instead of securing the scene.

95
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,149
- Yes.
- Why?

96
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,290
I'd noticed a car
speeding away from the scene.

97
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:59,490
I thought it would take a while to put
the fire out and Forensics to start,

98
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,860
so I decided to give chase.

99
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,389
And I saw the car...

100
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,529
drive into the police station.

101
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,529
And then?

102
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,870
Did you come into the office?

103
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Yes.

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,769
When you came in...

105
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,110
What was the situation like?

106
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,879
There was no one here.

107
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,019
What?

108
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:29,449
The room was empty
when I came in, but...

109
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,720
Soo Hyun's desk area was a mess.

110
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,860
- And then?
- I cleaned up,

111
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,000
then went downstairs
to see the CCTV footage.

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Why?

113
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,470
To locate you and because...

114
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,800
the office situation seemed off.

115
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,269
And?

116
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,569
The system...

117
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,839
failed to record what had happened then.

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,540
I told the security staff to fix it.

119
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,149
They couldn't.

120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,779
The bottom line is that...

121
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,250
I should've stayed and managed
the Lee Myung Guk scene,

122
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,550
and I know it was my mistake
to leave early.

123
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,420
I know you must think...

124
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,160
- I lack in many ways and...
- No.

125
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,930
It's not that. Don't mind it.

126
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,600
I was a bit too tired...

127
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,199
and on edge, I guess.

128
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,440
Hey, she pulled over. Stop the car.

129
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,190
- Yoon Jin.
- What?

130
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Over there.

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Hey.

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,429
- Did you bring your camera?
- You bet.

133
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,870
Here.

134
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,980
Look at that punk smile.

135
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,279
Are you having fun?

136
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,830
What's that?

137
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,490
I suddenly craved some caffeine.

138
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,230
Are you the only one that needs caffeine?

139
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,330
You should learn to share.

140
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:02,909
I'm heading in.

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,379
Okay. Take care.

142
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,299
Thanks.

143
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,379
Shall we move tables?

144
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,149
Drink your coffee.

145
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:55,659
(Oh Yoon Jin)

146
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:57,429
(Oh Yoon Jin)

147
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,059
Why did you come over so suddenly?

148
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,230
I didn't know Jae Gyeong would be there.

149
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,399
You should've texted me.

150
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,340
It didn't sound off, did it?

151
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Did he suspect anything?

152
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,539
We got away with it.

153
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,480
What did he want?

154
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,779
He asked to see Jun Seo's laptop
and some USB flash drives.

155
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,679
He looked for videos and played them all.

156
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,750
Videos? Like what?

157
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,690
I sat next to him and watched.

158
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,860
They were clips of Yoon Hee
or stuff we'd taken on trips.

159
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,490
I don't know what he was looking for,

160
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,259
but I don't think he found it.

161
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,129
Don't mind him. There's nothing he can do.

162
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,309
So,

163
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,440
did you give it some thought?

164
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,679
About what?

165
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,309
About what I said last time.

166
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,919
About leaving together?

167
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,950
Wasn't that a joke?

168
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,320
- I'm not in the mood for jokes.
- Do you think I am?

169
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,019
You barged in out of the blue
and strangled me,

170
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,389
demanding I hand over the passcode.

171
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,029
- And now you want to leave together?
- A passcode?

172
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,330
He strangled her?

173
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,200
I apologized profusely
and more than enough for that.

174
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,240
Let's not drag it on.

175
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,809
If I give you the passcode,

176
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,110
will you really leave with me?

177
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,379
Yes.

178
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:27,919
You say you'll quit your job
and elope with me,

179
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,789
but why can't you say
you'll get a divorce?

180
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,690
Isn't that the right order?

181
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:34,960
Get a divorce.

182
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,299
Then I'll give you the passcode
and go anywhere with you.

183
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,700
I will get a divorce,

184
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:43,269
but not in the order you want, Ji Yeon.

185
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,169
You can't get divorced overnight.

186
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,539
If we move abroad together,

187
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,710
I can get someone
to file the paperwork for me.

188
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,940
- Why is that so important?
- It is important.

189
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,080
I don't want to be...

190
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,919
an adulterer who fools around
with married men.

191
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,250
So until you bring me
the signed divorce papers,

192
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,519
I won't tell you anything.

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Give me your hand.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,029
Come on.

195
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,669
Ji Yeon.

196
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,909
I love you.

197
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,509
What's most important to us now...

198
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,980
is our sincere love for each other.

199
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,250
And...

200
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,889
my feelings won't change.

201
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,649
At this moment...

202
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,720
and in the future,

203
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,990
what's most important to me...

204
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,259
is you.

205
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,000
What a joke.

206
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,639
The money in there...

207
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,980
It belongs to us,
the people who know the passcode.

208
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,009
It's more than enough
to start over anywhere,

209
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,009
so let's...

210
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,149
be a little wiser.

211
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,559
Give me a little more time.

212
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,929
It's not an easy decision for me either.

213
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,000
Shall we leave?
Let's get something nice to eat.

214
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,549
What are you doing? Follow them.

215
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,450
They'll notice if I follow them there too.

216
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,889
Darn it.

217
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:47,690
Did you have breakfast?

218
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,659
I haven't yet, so I'm hungry.

219
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,789
But then and even now,

220
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,559
I've never been able to eat...

221
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,830
after paying my respects to a victim.

222
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,769
Shall we have some gukbap?

223
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,240
He wouldn't have died...

224
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,610
if not for me.

225
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,679
Why guilt-trip yourself?

226
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,240
Catch the killer.

227
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,679
He was watching me from close by.

228
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,320
He learned about the camera because of me.

229
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,519
He knew I'd go back to my car,

230
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,929
and he used that opening.

231
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,090
Jae Gyeong.

232
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,899
Are you hiding something
from me these days?

233
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,940
You always did a good job
investigating cases,

234
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,980
and I kept my distance and watched
to stay out of the way.

235
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,080
But the day you found Lee's body
and then this time.

236
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,120
It feels weird.

237
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,090
Talk to me if you're stuck on something.

238
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,490
When did worrying about it
on your own ever work?

239
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,460
Everyone who can talk is talking about it.

240
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,930
They're saying...

241
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,470
you're poking around...

242
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,299
in other people's cases
for the insurance money.

243
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,170
That you look down on others
since you got promoted.

244
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,970
Is that what you're like?

245
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,309
I need to know something
if I'm to cover for you.

246
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,349
The tip-off on the delivery...

247
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,549
at the subway station.

248
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,519
It was from...

249
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,259
my dead friend Park Jun Seo.

250
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,490
The 1882 text?
From the Doctor or something?

251
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,930
And...

252
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,799
Lee Myung Guk whose body I found.

253
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,940
He was a researcher
at Keumhyung Pharmaceutical,

254
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,740
and he knew Jun Seo
from their high school music club.

255
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,380
What does Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
have to do with it?

256
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,140
The CEO of Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

257
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,950
(We offer our deepest condolences.)

258
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,380
The prosecutor who did the postmortem.

259
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,150
Me and Oh Yoon Jin, the journalist...

260
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,119
mentioned in the written will.

261
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,059
We were all in the same class
in high school.

262
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,390
Then...

263
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,529
your dead friend who sent you
the Lemon Mulberry tip-off,

264
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,730
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical's CEO,

265
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,099
and the current deputy chief prosecutor
are all involved?

266
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,710
I see why you kept it to yourself.

267
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,150
Do you have an outline of the whole case?

268
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,650
I have my suspicions,

269
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,990
but they're all hard to prove.

270
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,259
Yoo Kyung Hwan wants to...

271
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,859
file your friend's suicide,
Lee Myung Guk's death,

272
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,829
and this murder
all as separate, unrelated cases.

273
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:49,269
Are you...

274
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,000
going to keep digging?

275
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,839
Yes.

276
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,809
I can't give permission.

277
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,450
But I just condoned it.

278
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,119
There's one more thing...

279
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,019
I need you to condone.

280
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,059
Number three. Yes, that one.

281
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,630
Hey.

282
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,630
- Unit Chief Jeong.
- Salute.

283
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,099
What do I owe the honor?

284
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,539
It's no honor.

285
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Here.

286
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,240
Cheol Hong, this is a rare cup of coffee.

287
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,240
It's almost impossible to get a coffee...

288
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,680
Unit Chief Jeong paid for herself.

289
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,349
I can't believe it happened to me
before I retired.

290
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:38,650
Don't be silly.

291
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,220
- Are you busy?
- No.

292
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,019
Then can I have a word?

293
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,299
You're scaring me. What is this about?

294
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:54,630
Jang Jae Gyeong.

295
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,430
Jang Jae Gyeong?

296
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,470
That punk hasn't returned his gun.

297
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,809
How much longer
must I break the rules to put up with it?

298
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Until...

299
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,680
I tell you to stop.

300
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:10,779
What?

301
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,019
You have ten days at most.

302
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,559
On Monday two weeks from now,

303
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,559
a routine firearms
and ammo inspection is scheduled.

304
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,029
You must...

305
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,329
find your gun and put it back before then.

306
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,640
That's the most I can do for you.

307
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,009
Hello?

308
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,720
Hello. I work at Anhyun City Hall Station.

309
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,119
You checked our CCTV footage.

310
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,490
- Yes.
- I'd like to speak with you.

311
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,829
Did you see it?

312
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,799
It's what I saw last time.

313
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,130
No, look.

314
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,170
Did you see it?

315
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,539
What is that?

316
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,450
The trains weren't in service yet,

317
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,880
and we'd left
the screen doors open for testing.

318
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,549
Here it is.

319
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,950
I checked yesterday
and found this on the tracks.

320
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,470
The money in there...

321
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,000
It belongs to us,
the people who know the passcode.

322
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,069
It's more than enough
to start over anywhere,

323
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,069
So,

324
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,680
we...

325
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,549
The money in there belongs...

326
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,150
to you and me
since only we know the passcode.

327
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,519
It's...

328
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,220
"Belongs to you and me
since only we know the passcode."

329
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,990
Then why did he ask CW for the passcode?

330
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,799
Does Tae Jin not know it?

331
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,029
You're right.

332
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,130
It sounds like a large sum of money.

333
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,640
Where is that money from,
and what kind of account is it?

334
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,269
How come only CW knows the passcode?

335
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,970
Is Tae Jin panicking
because he doesn't know it?

336
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,910
What's certain...

337
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,480
is that it's dirty money.

338
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,150
Also, the original owner
of this account is Park Tae Jin.

339
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,319
- What?
- Right?

340
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,359
Listen to the conversation carefully.

341
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,359
CW doesn't even know
how much is in there right now.

342
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:37,829
Right.

343
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,259
Look.

344
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,730
Tae Jin says...

345
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,470
it's enough for them to start
a new life anywhere,

346
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,799
but he doesn't say the amount.

347
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:50,339
This means CW has no idea
what kind of account it is.

348
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:53,279
She also has no idea...

349
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
where the money came from.

350
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,380
So she knows the passcode,

351
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,079
but she can't withdraw the money.

352
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,650
She doesn't know
how much is in there either.

353
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,789
But...

354
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,220
if Park Tae Jin is the account holder,

355
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,390
why wouldn't he know the passcode?

356
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,670
(Woohyun Hearing Aid)

357
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,420
Where did you get this?

358
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,390
It's from a crime scene.

359
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,089
I heard this was the only place...

360
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,930
that supplies the product in Anhyun.

361
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,099
Yes, it's from our store.

362
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,230
Do a lot of people use this model?

363
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,099
Not really.

364
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:58,380
People prefer smaller
and lighter products these days.

365
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,440
Is it possible to tell me who bought this?

366
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:09,920
They came yesterday.

367
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,319
What?

368
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,059
They came here to get a new one...

369
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,660
to replace the missing side.

370
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,730
But I don't know their name...

371
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,130
or their number.

372
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,400
What did they look like?

373
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,029
Make a guess.

374
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,970
He looked like a troublemaker, no less.

375
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,009
They'll come back.

376
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,180
Usually,
people return to adjust the volume.

377
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,490
Hello.

378
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,259
I was wondering
when you would come today.

379
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,130
Ta-da. I kept it aside for you.

380
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,630
Thank you.

382
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,710
What are you doing?

383
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Did you eat?

384
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,450
I did. Why?

385
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,779
No reason. I was just curious about
what you were doing.

386
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,789
Hey, why did you go
to Choi Ji Yeon's yesterday?

387
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,519
I had to check something.

388
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,430
And? Did you find out anything?

389
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,130
(And? Did you find out anything?)

390
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,130
No.

391
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,829
But how did you know I went there?

392
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:36,410
(But how did you know I went there?)

393
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,140
He didn't find out anything?

394
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,609
(But how did you know I went there?)

395
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,009
Well,

396
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,180
Joo Song dropped you off nearby,

397
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,150
so I made a guess.

398
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,349
(So I made a guess.)

399
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,690
Are you feeling okay?

400
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,190
Are you craving the drug?

401
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,319
(Are you craving the drug?)

402
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,289
I'm okay. Don't mind me and focus on work.

403
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:57,029
Are you serious?

404
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,400
(Don't mind me and focus on work.)

405
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,630
How can I not?

406
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,769
(Don't mind me and focus on work.)

407
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,299
I'm the only one who knows
you're a walking time bomb.

408
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,309
(Don't mind me and focus on work.)

409
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,910
If there are any signs, contact me.

410
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,109
You refused to see a doctor
until the case was solved.

411
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,210
This is the least I can do.

412
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,049
All right.

413
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,990
So how did Park Bok Rye's case go?

414
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,359
(So how did Park Bok Rye's case go?)

415
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,259
I'm about to call her son again.

416
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,529
I'll call you if I find out anything.

417
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:32,259
Hey.

418
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,529
You should call me too.

419
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,869
Don't keep information to yourself.

420
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:37,769
Fine.

421
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:38,839
(Fine.)

(Chairman, Won Chang Ho)

433
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,079
Let's start.

434
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,220
(Pilo-dong Development Plan)

435
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
Now,

436
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:36,589
I will begin the presentation
on the Pilo-dong Development Plan.

437
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,359
What you see on the screen...

438
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,759
is the district
in Pilo-dong planned for development.

439
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,500
This is Pilo-dong.

440
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,829
It's 1.8 million square meters.

441
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Out of this,

442
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,730
eighty-one percent was bought
in advance...

443
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:55,069
by you, the chairman, and our people.

444
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,210
The remaining 19 percent...

445
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,410
The remaining 19 percent
is privately owned...

446
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,180
But it won't get in the way of the plan.

447
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,849
But it's unlikely it'll get in the way
of this plan.

448
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:06,849
But,

449
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,619
if you say this,

450
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,089
the chairman will definitely question you.

451
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,490
I'm not sure if it will go smoothly.

452
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,029
Maybe you forgot,

453
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,400
but 20 years ago during
the first Anhyun development project,

454
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,529
we also owned a large percentage
but still faced difficulties.

455
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,940
We shouldn't overlook the 19 percent.

456
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,509
As for those landowners, how much...

457
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,509
Right.

458
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,910
You have a point,

459
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,609
but that was 20 years ago.

460
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,920
Are you telling me...

461
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,750
to ignore the chairman's opinion?

462
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,849
How much longer do you plan
to stay in the chairman's shadow?

463
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:48,119
If you let him walk all over you
at your first presentation,

464
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,329
this project will go under him too.

465
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Won Jong Soo,

466
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,029
show us what you've got.

467
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,569
Show everyone you can lead
this project on your own.

468
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,809
The only thing getting in the way
of this project...

469
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,769
is the city of Anhyun.

470
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,309
Mayor Joo In Sang of Anhyun thinks...

471
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,579
Keumhyung Group made excessive earnings
during the first...

472
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,980
and second Anhyun development plans
in 2003.

473
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,289
He believes Keumhyung Group made
excessive earnings.

474
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,250
So even if he heard
of the Pilo-dong Development Plan...

475
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,890
via an official route...

476
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,660
He doesn't think
Keumhyung Group should do it.

477
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:23,789
So?

478
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,630
What Mayor Joo In Sang wants...

479
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,799
is not a residential town
that's over 20 years old.

480
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,400
What he wants is an industrial complex
that's future progressive.

481
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:34,769
("Biotechnology Professor Joo In Sang,
Blueprint for Promoting Bioindustry")

482
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:35,869
This article was written...

483
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:38,680
when Mayor Joo was a university professor.

484
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,640
What he wants...

485
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,779
is a bioindustrial complex.

486
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,109
He wants it
to attract pharmaceutical companies...

487
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,880
and have related organizations
and labs concentrated in one area.

488
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,250
What he wants to make
is a large-scale industrial complex.

489
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,890
We need at least 30 companies for it.

490
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,490
In order to do this,
we need Korea's biggest Yigu Biotech...

491
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:59,759
and Yongsung Pharmacy to move in.

492
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,369
We're already in negotiation with them,

493
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,000
and their feedback is positive.

494
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,710
Do you know Mayor Joo In Sang well?

495
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,539
I have yet to meet him,

496
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,910
but I'm aware of
what kind of person he is.

497
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,309
You should've met with him.

498
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
He's more ambitious...

499
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,910
than he looks.

500
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,079
- Such a person...
- Right.

501
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,349
He wants a bioindustrial complex,

502
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,490
but not for genuine reasons.

503
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,559
What Mayor Joo In Sang wants...

504
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,190
is an achievement.

505
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,700
By establishing
a successful bioindustrial complex,

506
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,230
he can make himself look like
a politician deeply rooted in the region.

507
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,769
Moreover, it can create a path...

508
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,140
for him to join the central government.

509
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,210
I can create...

510
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,680
what Mayor Joo dreams of.

511
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,349
We'll make fair contributed acceptance...

512
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,420
and attract investment honorably.

513
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,759
The chairman looked pleased.

514
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:00,359
Your speech was impressive.

515
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,660

the chairman is asking for you.

516
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960

Well...

00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,059
Are you the one who asked Eunsung Realty
for my number?

525
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,430
Yes, I'm sorry. Please don't be upset.

526
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,900
How can I not be upset?

527
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,069
How dare you go around
abusing my mother's name?

528
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,069
I heard you introduced yourself
as my mother's foster daughter.

529
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,440
I'm going to sue you.

530
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:51,839
Hey.

531
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,980
I know you don't dare touch
the people you should sue.

532
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,509
Who are you threatening to sue?

533
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,319
- What?
- You're her son.

534
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,549
Why aren't you doing anything
to prove she died unfairly?

535
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,819
I'm offering to help,
yet you won't see me.

536
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,190
I had no other choice
but to get your number.

537
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,789
So what?

538
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,859
What are you screaming for?
It's not like you're someone special.

539
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,029
- What did you say?
- Doesn't it make you mad?

540
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,369
It's clearly a medical accident,

541
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,500
but you're not getting any compensation.

542
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,369
Just sit there and sulk.

543
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:25,069
Your mother would be happy to see that.

544
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,579
What do you want?

545
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,660
What I want?

546
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,029
The truth behind what happened.

547
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,869
Come over.

548
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:04,910
How long has it been...

549
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,480
since we texted that person
who sells Lemon Mulberry?

550
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,680
About two hours.

551
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,590
They'll reply.

552
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,690
The quantity is too big
for them to ignore.

553
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,889
Someone has to go out with him
when they get in touch.

554
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,590
Who wants to go?

555
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,199
I'll go.

556
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,369
I sneaked in last time
by impersonating a druggie.

557
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,170
You two can do it next time.
I'll go this round.

558
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,469
Soo Hyun, keep an eye on the text.

559
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,070
Okay.

560
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,949
(Keumhyung Group)

561
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,019
Did you see your friend off
at his funeral?

562
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,829
I did.

563
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,530
Here.

564
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,130
You should try and meet
with Mayor Joo In Sang.

565
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:02,969
Figure out exactly what he wants
before you make your move.

566
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:05,940
Yes, sir.

567
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:10,710
Was it Tae Jin's idea?

568
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,920
I can see traces
of his manner of speaking...

569
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:17,820
in your business plan.

570
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,119
The same goes for your presentation.

571
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:24,659
Tell him I said this.

572
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,969
Don't get sidetracked
and do your best until it's wrapped.

573
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,440
If he needs any support,
give him the best you can.

574
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:36,809
Yes, sir.

575
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,179
How could you get this wrong?

576
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:19,679
(May, 2003)

577
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,019
(Mathematics)

578
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,500
Park Tae Jin?

579
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,739
I heard you got the highest midterm score
at school.

580
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes, sir.

581
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,670
He was always ranked first
ever since middle school.

582
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:48,380
Of course, he entered high school
with the top marks too.

583
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,880
What do your parents do?

584
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,119
Cow...

585
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,280
They farm cows.

586
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,219
They run a livestock farm
right where the city of Hwansung starts.

587
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,360
Jong Soo told me a lot about you.

588
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,190
He says you're smart and polite.

589
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,099
He also says you're loyal.

590
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:11,269
What kind of friend is Jong Soo to you?

591
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,139
(Won Jong Soo)

592
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,980
A rich friend.

593
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:22,679
Do you not like that he's rich?

594
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,179
I envy him.

595
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,019
I envy your parents
for having a son like you.

596
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,159
It seems we envy each other
for what we have.

597
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,130
Do you wish to be rich too?

598
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,869
Yes.

599
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,699
What will you do to become rich?

600
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,940
I'll continue to keep my place in first.

601
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,969
Until...

602
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,840
there's no one else above me.

603
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,119
I always wish for Jong Soo
to get the first place.

604
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,519
I got him a tutor...

605
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,659
and did everything I could with money.

606
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:08,719
But it looks like this is his limit.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,829
How about this?

608
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,900
Keep your place in first place,

609
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,969
and I promise...

610
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:22,199
to support everything you need
that requires money.

611
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:27,039
In return,
make Jong Soo the richest man in Korea.

612
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,909
Wouldn't that satisfy both of us?

613
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,219
Of course, you'd become extremely rich
if you stayed with Jong Soo.

614
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,920
For the next three years,
Jong Soo and Tae Jin will stay...

615
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,059
in the same class as your students...

616
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,789
even if they move up in grades.

617
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,059
As their teacher, look after them...

618
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:50,230
and assign any useful individuals
to Jong Soo's class.

619
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,500
Yes, sir.

620
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,969
Young Master,

621
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,440
what are you doing here?

622
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,630
What's next on my schedule?

624
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:19,659
You have to go
to Keumhyung Pharmaceutical Lab...

625
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,530
for the new researchers' training.

626
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:32,070
Soo Hyun, any updates?

627
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,510
Should I urge them to reply...

628
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,809
saying we're in desperate need
of the drugs?

629
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,679
No, they'll reply. Let's wait.

630
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,780
What's wrong?

631
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:33,940
Captain, what are you doing here?

632
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,539
(Temporary Evidence Storage)

633
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,559
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

634
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:01,860
Gosh, you scared me.

635
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,869
Hey, what are you doing here?

636
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
What?

637
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,179
I asked you what you were doing.

638
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,550
What's up with you?

639
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Are you sick?

640
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,119
I think I have a cold.

641
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,460
Would you like to catch it too?

642
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,099
Darn it.

643
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,469
You need to get going soon.

644
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,070
Okay.

645
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:16,510
- Hello. Please come in.
- Thank you.

646
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,550
- Here you go.
- Oh, right.

647
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,550
I'll record...

648
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,719
what you say.

649
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,719
Okay.

650
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,500
When exactly did your mother pass away?

651
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,570
September 11 of last year.

652
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,530
How...

653
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:47,639
She had a brain tumor.

654
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
I see.

655
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:53,340
The hospital said she couldn't even do
chemotherapy anymore.

656
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,380
So, we had gotten a large prescription...

657
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,179
for the painkillers she used to take.

658
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,019
It was called...

659
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,150
Hang on.

660
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
This was it.

661
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:08,789
This was what she'd take every day.

662
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,289
Oh, it's written here.

663
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,289
Xinopharm.

664
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,630
(Xinopharm)

665
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,429
"Pain relieving medication, Xinopharm."

666
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,800
But that day, she seemed a bit strange.

667
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,269
Which day?

668
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,070
The day before she passed away.

669
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,380
After she took that medicine,

670
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,710
she suddenly started seizing.

671
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,280
She was having cold sweats,
and she was rambling too.

672
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,920
Then, she fell asleep.

673
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,889
And early the next morning,

674
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:42,519
someone kept touching my leg
while I was asleep.

675
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,559
So, I woke up startled.

676
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:45,559
My mother,

677
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:49,570
who hadn't even been able
to turn over in her bed by herself,

678
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,039
was sitting halfway up and was waking me.

(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical,
A Talk with the CEO)

681
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,789
Welcome to the executives and employees
of Keumhyung Pharmaceutical...

682
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:12,119
who are here today.

683
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,260
Today's lecture will be given by
Keumhyung Group's Vice-Chairman...

684
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,190
and Keumhyung Pharmaceutical's CEO.

685
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,429
Here is CEO Won Jong Soo.

686
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,469
Was it Tae Jin's idea?

687
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,869
I can see traces
of his manner of speaking...

688
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:29,340
in your business plan.

689
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,610
The same goes for your presentation.

690
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,809
I envy your parents
for having a son like you.

691
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:39,820
Everyone, here is CEO Won Jong Soo.

692
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,579

with a round of applause.

- What's going on?
- Wake up.

696
00:44:58,969 --> 00:44:59,969
Wake up.

697
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:01,969
Out of the way!

698
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,969
- What happened?
- Jong Soo, wake up.

699
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,510

Here.

00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:11,510
Oh, gosh.

702
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,650
Get out!

703
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,750
What's going on?

704
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,150
No one comes inside. Got it?

705
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,389
Jong Soo, wake up. Okay?

706
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,159
Jong Soo, it's okay.

707
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:24,829

708
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,960

710
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:37,739
Jong Soo.

711
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:39,880
I told you that no one could come in!

712
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,710
Feed him this now.

713
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,789
Jong Soo.

714
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,949
Jong Soo, swallow this, okay?

715
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,360
Swallow this.

716
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,159
Jong Soo, it's okay.

717
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,329
Jong Soo, wake up!

Jong Soo.

720
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:07,340
At first, I was surprised,

721
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:09,769
but I thought
her condition might've improved,

722
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:11,570
so I gave her more of the medicine.

723
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
And?

724
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,710
Then, she passed away that evening.

725
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,280
I'm sure there was something weird
about that medicine.

If not, she would've had
another few months, at least...

727
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,260
A few years more...

728
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:27,789
to live.

729
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,460
What did the hospital say?

730
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,559
The hospital?

731
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,260
I couldn't believe it.

732
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,170
They said it was her time to go,
so she did.

733
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:42,000
After I heard that, I was so furious...

734
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,639
that I cursed them out.

735
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:46,139
Then, the next day, someone came.

736
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,610
And they took away all of the medicine
we had gotten back then.

737
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:52,079
If that had been the case,
you could've said something...

738
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,449
the last time I came.

739
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,219
Why did you avoid me?

740
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:01,119
I promised them that I wouldn't cause
any more problems on this matter.

741
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,630
You must've gotten compensated.

742
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:08,199
They paid me the tiniest bit.

743
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,070
My mother had passed away.

744
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:12,900
If you write an article about this,

745
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,300
will those guys say they will pay me more?

746
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,309
Was it the people from the hospital...

747
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,210
who took the medicine away?

748
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,809
No. They came from
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

749
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:25,949
They said the pharmaceutical company
had to take the medicine back...

750
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:27,780
to see if there was something wrong.

751
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
One moment.

752
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,760
This is the business card
of the person who came back then.

753
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,630
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical, Park Jun Seo)

754
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,150
Ma'am.

755
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:58,349
We got a text.

756
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,460
(Let's meet around 6:30.
I'll let you know where.)

757
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm sure it's rare to meet in person
to make a deal.

758
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:21,039
Didn't they suspect you?

759
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,199
No.

760
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,769
They were actually grateful,

761
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,010
wondering how I had stuck it out
until now.

762
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,340
When you first met me,

763
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:31,050
you said you hadn't taken the pill
for about a week.

764
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:32,809
Yes.

765
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,280
If you take four pills a day,

766
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,289
it would've been hard to endure
a whole week without them.

767
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,050
I was close to death a few times.

768
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,289
How did you endure it?

769
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,329
I'm sure you didn't quit cold turkey.

770
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,460
You have that kind of experience,
don't you?

771
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,260
When someone chokes you hard...

772
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,699
and you're about to pass out,

773
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,170
but then, they let you go
for the tiniest moment,

774
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,670
you get a rush of air.

775
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,670
You feel like you can live again.

776
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,480
There's a pill that can help
to that degree.

777
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:04,179
What is that pill?

778
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,650
Come on.

779
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,719
I can't tell you that.

780
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,050
If you confiscate all of those pills too,

781
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:13,260
all of us druggies will die.

782
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,420
You're too greedy.

783
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,500
Mr. Kang,

784
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:30,409
you must be feeling comfortable...

785
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,769
since I order you
everything you want to eat...

786
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,349
and even let you use the phone.

787
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,980
Sorry.

788
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,349
The meeting is in Ohyeon-dong.

789
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,860
It's inside
the old Anhyun Shopping Mall...

790
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,289
where several electronics stores
used to be.

791
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,659
Most of the stores here have
gone out of business,

792
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,789
so it's now empty.

793
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,269
They said they'd meet in Unit 44.

794
00:49:58,269 --> 00:50:00,869
If they're meeting indoors,
where will we be?

795
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:01,869
We will be...

796
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:03,639
hiding here.

797
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,909
Then, you'll have to wear a mic.

798
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:07,880
They will search your body, though.

799
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,280
If we sew it into his jacket,

800
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,750
they won't be able to find it
with a rough body check.

801
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,849
We don't know
how much they trust Kang Min Ho.

802
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:18,289
They'll doubt me for sure,

803
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:21,619
It's highly likely that they won't bring
the pills to that meeting.

804
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,590
So, even if something goes down inside,

805
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:25,389
don't come in too rashly.

806
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,400
Got it.

807
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,559
But will you be okay?

808
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,570
You don't look too great.

809
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,699
I'm good.

810
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,570
Don't be like that.

811
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,809
Should I go in?

812
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,940
Why not?

813
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,780
I'm good at acting like a druggie.

814
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,280
Do you want to see it?

815
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:53,389
I'm cold. Give me some pills.

816
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,119
- Give me some pills.
- Hey, let's hurry up and get going.

817
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,889
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

818
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:01,429
So cold. Pills...

819
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,219
(To be demolished)

820
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:28,090
Is this it?

821
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,289
You will help me, right?

822
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,300
We're heading in now.

823
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,280
This place just keeps getting
more decrepit.

824
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:03,789
Senior.

825
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,969
Senior.

826
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,710
Senior.

827
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,650
It's nice to meet you both.

828
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,659
Senior, is that you?

829
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,730
Min Ho!

830
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,730
It's been a while.

831
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,969
- Senior.
- Yes.

832
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:46,400
I missed you.

833
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,969
You psycho.

834
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,570
What about backup?

835
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,440
The patrol unit's forces are standing by
three minutes away.

836
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,340
Hey, you look terrible.

837
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,210
I can't stand to see him
in this pitiful state.

838
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:58,349
Give him a pill first.

839
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:12,960
I haven't seen you before.

840
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Right.

841
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,039
Let me do a body search.

842
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,559
All right.

843
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,730
Mr. Jeon Young Kyu?

844
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,199
Yes.

845
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:55,969
You didn't bring any money, though.

846
00:53:58,639 --> 00:53:59,710
It's in the car.

847
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:01,579
I see.

848
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,750
I hear you've been taking our pills.

849
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:06,780
You seem rather normal.

850
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,820
How did you endure it?

851
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:14,489
How?

852
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,840
What is that pill?

853
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:33,110
You need a prescription for it.

854
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,309
It's called Etaphen.

855
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,510
Etaphen.

856
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,590
Oh, that anorectic agent?

857
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:52,090
I hear lots of people took that
to hang in there.

858
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,460
But I'm sure that wasn't enough
to do anything.

859
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,469
My dear customer.

860
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:00,070
You must be in quite a rush right now.

861
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:04,170
Okay.

862
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,139
Since this is the protocol
in our line of work,

863
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,210
please understand.

864
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,889
Gosh, hang on.

865
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,059
Loosen up.
We're just trying to make you feel good.

866
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,659
All right. Take off your clothes.

867
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,070
This is watered down Lemon Mulberry.
It's a new product.

868
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,239
You know that it acts faster
if you inject it, right?

869
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:41,309
Give it a taste.

870
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,079
Aren't they sticking a needle
in Captain's arm?

871
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,280
Those jerks are trying to check
if he's a cop or not.

872
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:48,550
What?

873
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,219
A druggie would stay still,

874
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:51,590
but a cop would be afraid
of being addicted...

875
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,090
that he'd pull his arm back
without meaning to.

876
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,320
Then, what about Captain?

877
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:57,860
Should we go in?

878
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:01,400
We don't know if that's really a drug
or just saline.

879
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:05,369
If we bust in without knowing,
it'll all go to waste if it's not a drug.

880
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,170
Captain Jang knows that,
which is why he's holding still.

881
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,769
Let's see.

882
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,280
Here comes the drug.

883
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,110
Okay!

884
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,110
We've checked your identity.

885
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,050
All right. This way.

886
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,079
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

887
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,789
Min Ho, take care of him.

888
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,829
You're handling yourself well.

889
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,400
Isn't it awesome?

890
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,159
Let's hurry. Come on.

891
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,429
Ta-da.

892
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,030
All right.

893
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,099
Let's go and get the money now.

894
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,630
Money first. Drugs later.

895
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:19,769
Okay?

896
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,710
That punk is a cop!

897
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:29,610
Kang Min Ho is on the run.

898
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:31,349
Darn it.

899
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:32,980
That jerk is a cop!

900
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,369
Min Ho, that psycho jerk.

901
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,239
Stop!

902
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,789
You darn cop!

903
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:36,949
Why?

904
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,010
You think wearing leather makes you a cop?

905
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:41,820
Stay still!

906
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:46,789
Who are you, lady?

907
00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:49,420
If you're an old lady, go home and cook.

908
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,860
Sure. I'm an old lady detective.

909
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,159
Go home to your kitchen.

910
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:56,230
No thanks, I like eating out.

911
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,369
I told you to stay still.

912
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,309
(Connection)

913
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,449
(Connection)

914
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:30,019
The needle they used to inject you...

915
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:31,650
We couldn't find it on the site.

916
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,320
Are you the one doing this to me?

917
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,690
This might be our last chance.

918
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,059
They won't just sit and watch.

919
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,130
It's too dangerous.

920
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:42,159
You look like you know
who killed Park Jun Seo.

921
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,599
Are you out of your mind?

922
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,570
That'll be the end of you too!

923
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,670
Maybe Park Tae Jin killed Park Jun Seo.

924
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,940
He was acting suspiciously at the funeral.

925
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,239
What causes
our biggest anxiety still remains.

926
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,239
That's why we should get rid of it.

927
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:55,239
We're heading in.

928
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,710
- Shall we go?
- What is this?

929
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,010
Yoon Jin!

930
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,449
Help!

931
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,619
Where are you right now?

932
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:06,849
