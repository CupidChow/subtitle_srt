1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,209
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,419
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,919
(Oh Chi Hyun)

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,160
Are you Jang Jae Gyeong?

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:23,899
Yes.

6
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,730
Is everything
on your police report true?

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,739
Did you witness it yourself?

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,670
(Park Jun Seo)

9
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Jun Seo.

10
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,380
You saw it. You should tell him.

11
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,280
Your report says...

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,820
Park Jun Seo witnessed it on-site.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,619
Is that true?

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,289
Did you really witness it?

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
I didn't witness anything.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
- Jun Seo.
- I...

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,400
didn't see anything.

18
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,939
I didn't see anything...

19
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,290
That's not true.

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,560
Don't lie.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,159
I didn't witness anything.

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,790
Don't lie...

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,269
That's not true.

24
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,500
I didn't witness anything.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
Jun Seo.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,579
(Connection)

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,450
(Monday, February 26, 2024)

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,859
(Episode 2)

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,030
Do you have any footage
of his whereabouts after the incident?

30
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,439
After he disappeared from the hallway,
he wasn't caught on camera.

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
(Captain Jang Jae Gyeong)

32
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,240
The phone is turned off.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,680
Transferring to voicemail.

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,710
You will be charged.

35
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,379
- Please check that separately.
- All right.

36
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,449
Do it fast.

37
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,590
Is he really from the police?

38
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,629
Yes, he is.

39
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,360
Did you try contacting him?

40
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,789
What did he say?

41
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,229
It seems like he's unable
to talk on the phone right now.

42
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,270
I apologize.

43
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,900
What do you mean?

44
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,099
He disturbed the emergency room.

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,639
It's a major offense
to cause disturbance around patients.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,069
On top of that, he's a detective.

47
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,969
Is the case closed
if you can't get in touch with him?

48
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,979
Please calm down.

49
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,849
I need to check what happened
before I can update you.

50
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:56,949
That's not right.

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,819
Are you protecting him
because you're also a detective?

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,120
We can't let him get away with it.

53
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,759
Look. I got hurt because he pushed me.

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,060
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,789
I'll check and update you.

56
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,930
I appreciate your patience.

57
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,259
He looked like he was addicted to drugs.

58
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,300
When you work in the emergency,

59
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
you see overdosed patients
from time to time.

60
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,099
His symptoms resembled them.

61
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,240
His breathing was unstable,
and his face was pale.

62
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,879
In my opinion, that detective...

63
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,439
Was that why you drew blood from me?

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,349
I never consented to drawing blood,

65
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,620
and there wasn't a warrant
to approve it either.

66
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,590
There were no injection marks on my arm.

67
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,020
Doctor Lee Young Woo.
Why did you decide to take my blood?

68
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,389
That's because people under the influence
of drugs come into the ER,

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,800
and it's common for us to take blood
with consent before the police come...

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,629
so they can be locked up.

71
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,870
They can get the warrant later on.

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,169
That's none of my business.

73
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,699
Which department are you with?

74
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,110
You don't look like an intern.

75
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,340
Are you a resident? Which year?

76
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,210
Why do you ask?

77
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,580
Is this a narcotics case?

78
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,849
From what I saw...

79
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,949
The symptoms you listed.

80
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,949
Are they proof to conclude
that this is a narcotics case?

81
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,919
Other than the experience
of your short stint as an ER doctor,

82
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,689
do you have objective proof?

83
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,050
I don't, but...

84
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,189
Why did you destroy
your blood that we'd taken?

85
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,430
Why wouldn't I?

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,830
It was my blood
taken without my consent.

87
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,860
It's illegal for you to run
all those tests on them.

88
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,170
- But...
- Detective Kim.

89
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,399
He says he thinks I'm on drugs.

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,540
I was on the drug squad
for over ten years...

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,240
and it must've made me a druggie.

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
I'm Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong...

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,050
of Anhyeon Police Station's
Narcotics Unit.

94
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,180
I'm not a drug addict.

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm an inspector who catches them.

96
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,790
I felt dreadful earlier
because I had acute indigestion,

97
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,389
and you took my blood
without my consent, so...

98
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,189
I did that because I was angry, okay?

99
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,800
- I hurt you?
- Yes.

100
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:52,230
I'm very sorry.

101
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Okay.

102
00:04:58,939 --> 00:04:59,939
Bye, then.

103
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,509
Get a copy of the CCTV footage...

104
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,939
- and send it to us.
- Okay.

105
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,910
See if there's a clip of him
coming into the ER.

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,910
Yes, sir.

107
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,959
(Inoculation Process)

108
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,730
Do you feel better now?

109
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,129
Yes. I'm fine.

110
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,100
Did you look up the number I gave you?

111
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,699
It was a burner phone.

112
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,069
- Did you track it?
- It was turned off.

113
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,899
I checked its last location
before it was turned off.

114
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,839
A call was made while on the move.

115
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,240
The red hair-clip woman...

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,339
Did you get the facial composite?

117
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,810
Her statement is inconsistent.

118
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,480
What about the face of the guy I chased?

119
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,779
We don't have that yet.
I'll send it to you when we do.

120
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,350
Why did you act like that in the ER?

121
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
I told you.

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,259
It was because they'd taken my blood
without my consent.

123
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,060
You'd made a proper mess.

124
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,769
I'm glad you talked your way out.

125
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,170
It could've been really bad.

126
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,410
I don't think you were here
because you felt ill.

127
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,009
Why did you come here?

128
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,009
You don't need to know.

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,829
Don't overdo it.

130
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,560
I'll say you went home
because you felt unwell.

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Get some rest.

132
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,430
The door is opening.

133
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,899
The door is opening.

134
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,040
The door is closing.

135
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,550
The door is closing.

136
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,699
Nurse Lee. Can I have a word?

137
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,699
Yes.

138
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,699
(Ward 31)

139
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,879
Captain.

140
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,680
I need to talk to him.

141
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
Go and get a soda.

142
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,579
Well...

143
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,389
Okay, then.

144
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:40,199
(Jang Chul Gu)

145
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,639
You wanted to see me.

146
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:48,269
Who, me?

147
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,410
As if I'd want to see your mug.

148
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,110
How do you know Park Jun Seo?

149
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Park Jun Seo?

150
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,519
Yes. I get it.

151
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:07,490
You'll never walk properly again.

152
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,589
You must've been angry.

153
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,060
Did you want revenge?

154
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,529
You've seen this before, right?

155
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,209
No.

156
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,439
What are you on about?

157
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,449
What revenge?

158
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
Who did you send to do it?

159
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,889
Why?

160
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,820
Is someone harassing you?

161
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,690
Gosh, I'm grateful for that.

162
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,330
I'd love to get back at you
if only I could.

163
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,960
But this right here.

164
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,070
Will you do something about it?

165
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,200
Then...

166
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
I'll show you.

167
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,340
Why did you kill Park Jun Seo?

168
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,179
I guess that punk is dead.

169
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,289
I wonder who Park Jun Seo is.

170
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,820
How interesting.

171
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,690
Jang Jae Gyeong...

172
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,090
came over out of the blue...

173
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,799
to ask me about him?

174
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,139
Do you have a thing for guys?

175
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,710
You should've said so, then.

176
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,340
If I'd known your taste,

177
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,179
we wouldn't be in this situation now.

178
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,889
Oh, come on. What the heck?

179
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,860
What are you up to?

180
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Hey.

181
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,230
I don't know that name.

182
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,669
Hey!

183
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,700
Captain Jang, I don't know him!

184
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,940
Hey, police! You punks!

185
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,110
Do something about him!

186
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,580
Hey, police! You outside!

187
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,210
Come in and stop him!

188
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Don't move.

189
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,429
One wrong move
and you'll eat through a tube forever.

190
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:22,429
No.

191
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:23,789
It wasn't me!

192
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,700
Did you send the text
about the Jeonghoon Station delivery?

193
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,070
Or did you make Park Jun Seo send it?

194
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,200
Or did you make someone else send it?

195
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,269
Who was it? Give me a name.

196
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,000
It wasn't me.
I've never heard that name before.

197
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,309
I know you killed Park Jun Seo.

198
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,240
It wasn't me!
I said I'd never heard that name!

199
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,509
You did it.

200
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,679
You put everyone up to it.

201
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:43,549
This is your last warning.

202
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:45,549
One.

203
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:48,889
- Two.
- No!

204
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,320
No! It wasn't me!

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,990
It wasn't me!

206
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,509
I said it wasn't me, punk.

207
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,279
If it wasn't you, who was it?
Give me a name.

208
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,409
I don't know.

209
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,919
That drug!

210
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,250
I heard about that drug.

211
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,289
Who's distributing it?

212
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,029
CEO Yoon.

213
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,029
CEO Yoon?

214
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,330
Is he the Doctor?

215
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,299
I don't know that.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,169
Does CEO Yoon distribute only?

217
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,669
Does he make it too?

218
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,500
He's just a distributor of this and that.

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,470
He brings in and sells
whatever makes him money.

220
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,379
Where can I go to meet him?

221
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
I don't know.

222
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,779
I really don't know. I swear!

223
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:50,779
I don't know!

224
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,299
He only distributes online.

225
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,870
I don't know his face or address.

226
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,570
He might be CEO Yoon today.

227
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:15,909
But tomorrow...

228
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,179
he could be CEO Kim or CEO Lee.

229
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:20,679
No one knows!

230
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:23,649
What about Park Jun Seo?

231
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,860
I really have never
heard that name before.

232
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,330
I would...

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,429
kill you before anyone.

234
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,470
Why would I kill someone like that?

235
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,539
Jin Wook.

236
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,480
You should go into hiding
instead of doing this.

237
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,179
What if the Doctor set this up
to hand us over to the police...

238
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,379
so he could deal directly with CEO Yoon?

239
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,750
Come on, Jin Wook.

240
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,909
It's been a while, CEO Yoon.

241
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,480
You must not be...

242
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,720
all that glad to see me.

243
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:10,889
What about the drugs?

244
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,919
I'm sure you've already heard,

245
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,559
but the supply of raw materials
isn't very smooth.

246
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,559
I think I might need some more time.

247
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,029
Mr. Gong Jin Wook?

248
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,570
CEO Yoon.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,100
You know very well...

250
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,210
that if we make contact first,
the deal with the Doctor is over.

251
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,840
Why not wait a little longer
while you're already waiting?

252
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,440
It's not like there is...

253
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,549
a drug that can replace
Lemon Mulberry at the moment.

254
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,789
Can I trust that you're still making
direct deals with the Doctor?

255
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,759
Seeing how...

256
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,629
the Doctor isn't making
direct deals with you,

257
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:51,799
wouldn't that mean...

258
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,370
he's still willing to do business with me?

259
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,210
The wire is too short. I'll switch it.

260
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,250
Okay.

261
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,460
- I'll finish things up.
- Okay.

262
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,509
What are your plans from now on?

263
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,639
I'll get things ready by this week.

264
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,149
Let's make it tomorrow at midnight.

265
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,419
If you go past midnight,

266
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,279
I'll also stop dealing Lemon Mulberry...

267
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,820
and focus on going around to catch people.

268
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,090
And I'll make a reservation...

269
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,259
for this room under both of your names.

270
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,159
Please save me!

271
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:01,899
Go ahead.

272
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,870
I'll see you tomorrow.

273
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,379
Wasn't the Doctor going to
let go of that guy...

274
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,620
and deal with us directly?

275
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,720
That was the condition for us abducting
Jang Jae Gyeong and drugging him.

276
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,360
What kind of grudge does the Doctor have
against Jang Jae Gyeong?

277
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,230
Where should I drop you off
near Anhyun City Hall Station?

278
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,639
Oh, right.

279
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,610
Yes, just up there, please.

00:16:58,789 --> 00:16:59,820
(Anhyun City Hall)

281
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,609
If you had gotten here late last night,

282
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,950
you would've been spotted
while we did our nightly patrols.

283
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,380
You most likely came here
in the morning...

284
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,849
when the first trains operated.

285
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,650
Let's watch the footage from that time.

286
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,990
Okay.

287
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,079
We can't zoom in any closer.

288
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,380
Please show me the footage
from near the elevators.

289
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Okay.

290
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,160
Both of them are around 180cm in height.

291
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:12,630
Weight, over 80kg.

292
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,400
All right. Let me see.

293
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,599
What are they looking at?

294
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,509
Door 3-4.

295
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Hang on.

296
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,380
Can we see this scene
caught on another camera?

297
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,180
Is there a camera from another angle?

298
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,519
One second.

299
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,490
This is all we have.

301
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,470
Please give me a copy of these files.

00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:52,769
Okay.

- Please send it to this email here.
- All right.

(Jeonghoon Station)

306
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,160
Those guys knew that there would be
a drug toss...

307
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,619
at Door 3-4 of Jeonghoon Station.

308
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,099
Also, they hoped I'd get on the train
at that spot.

309
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,829
That means, they wanted me to arrest
the guy in the baseball cap.

310
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,539
Who is CEO Yoon, and who is the Doctor?

311
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,640
Is the guy in the baseball cap CEO Yoon?

312
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,950
Are they using me to get rid of
a competing gang?

313
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,880
The guy who sent this message...

314
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,349
hoping I'd show up at platform 3-4.

315
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,619
Also, the guy who abducted me
and drugged me.

316
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,029
Those two...

317
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,130
are one person.

318
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,599

319
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,099

322
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,210
One, eight, eight, two.

323
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,380
But...

324
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,750
Park Jun Seo is dead.

(At the time of case closure)

327
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,289
Did you find a suicide note
or anything else?

328
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,960
No, all we found were his shoes
on the ninth floor.

329
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,829
If it's a construction site,
don't they work on Saturdays too?

330
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,529
Why was he only found on Monday?

331
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,599
Well, they couldn't work on the weekend
because of complaints.

332
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,970
They haven't done an autopsy yet, right?

333
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,609
Actually, they have.

334
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,910
I was surprised too,
but the autopsy is already done.

335
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,349
I believe he's in the morgue
at Anhyun University Hospital now.

336
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,880
Who was the prosecutor
who ordered the autopsy?

337
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,220
One second.

338
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,990
It's Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

339
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,720
He's the deputy chief prosecutor of
Criminal Division One.

340
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,730
What was the cause of death?

341
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,369
As you can see,
he fell from the ninth floor.

342
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,299
There is no way
he wouldn't be a total mess.

Oh, yes. Is that right?

346
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:28,960
Then, you can just handle it that way.

347
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,930
Okay.

348
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,299
Well, but...

00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,069
The deceased, Park Jun Seo...

350
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,799
and Jang Jae Gyeong,
an inspector at our station...

351
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,440
It turns out that
those two were friends from high school.

352
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,769
Didn't you say you graduated from
Jeogang High School as well?

- So...
- Come on!

00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:07,130
Honestly speaking, it's not like...

360
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,400
we're in a situation
where we have to explain everything.

361
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,329
Since the victim was your friend,

362
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,099

Get going now. That's enough.

364
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,289
Hey, you! Grab him!

365
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,130
- Jang Jae Gyeong!
- Captain Jang!

366
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:37,859
You punk!

367
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,630
- Captain Jang!
- Out of the way.

368
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,740
Jang Jae Gyeong. Open up!

369
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,069
Open up, you crazy jerk!

370
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,170
Do you think
I'll let you get away with this?

371
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,539
(Oh Chi Hyun, Park Tae Jin, Won Jong Soo)

372
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,079
The estimated time of death is...

373
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,980
between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:00 a.m. last Friday.

374
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,349
Open up before I knock this down!

375
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:00,019
- Give it back now. Captain!
- Open up.

376
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,319
- Gosh, what do you think you're doing?
- Open up.

377
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,450
Captain Jang!

378
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,450
(Oh Yoon Jin)

379
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,690
Darn it!

380
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,660
Hey.

381
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,960
Get out here, you jerk!

382
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,000
You crazy jerk.

383
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,470
Do you think I'm being funny?

384
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,049
That crazy jerk.

385
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,579
You're here.

386
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,500
(Oh Chi Hyun, Park Tae Jin, Won Jong Soo)

387
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,369
It looks like you took your pill.

388
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,339
Chang Soo.

389
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,539
Do you remember the number
I asked you to check earlier?

390
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,940
- The burner phone.
- Yes?

391
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,910
I'll buy time,
so track its location right now.

392
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,910
Okay.

393
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,220
Who are you?

394
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,150
Hello. I need you to urgently track
the location of 010-0325-1533.

395
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,059
Don't hang up.

396
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,390
- Please check now and tell me.
- Guess?

397
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,230
(How do you know...)

398
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,829
How do you know about 1882?

399
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,200
(- Guess?
- How do you know about 1882?)

400
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,799
Because it's me.

401
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,039
(Park Jun Seo...)

402
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,869
Park Jun Seo died.

403
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,369
I never said I was Park Jun Seo.

404
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,410
So where are you going to go next?

405
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,039
To Park Jun Seo's funeral?

406
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,250
Or maybe to catch that guy
you lost at the subway station?

407
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,920
(Or maybe to catch that guy
you lost at the subway station?)

408
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,390
(What's...)

409
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,119
What's the connection
between Park Jun Seo and the drug?

410
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:45,819
(What's the connection
between Park Jun Seo and the drug?)

411
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,420
Why did you drug me?

412
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,430
Got anything?

413
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,329
You'll find out sooner or later.

414
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:58,000
It'd make more sense to go
to the funeral if you're a good friend.

415
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Have a good one.

416
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,309
Well?

417
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,339
They were moving while using the phone.

418
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,250
They were heading from Anhyun Stream
to Jungji-dong.

419
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,549
"Jungji-dong?"

420
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,380
The postmortem examination
was already done.

421
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,819
He must be in the morgue
of Anhyun University Hospital.

422
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,220
Anhyun University Hospital.

423
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

424
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,799
(Park Jun Seo)

425
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,069
He was handed over.

426
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,640
What?

427
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,240
He was handed over to his family
about an hour ago.

428
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,369
Without an autopsy?

429
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,910
Yes. The prosecutor said
they received the family's consent.

430
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,009
They didn't want an autopsy...

431
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,980
and decided to proceed with the funeral.

432
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,849
Which prosecutor conducted
the postmortem examination?

433
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:46,950
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

434
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,319
He's the deputy chief prosecutor
of Criminal Division One.

435
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,019
Okay.

436
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,630
(Sunghan Bank)

437
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,960
Please check your balance...

438
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,970
and select the service you want.

439

Please select the service you want.

442
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,279
Darn it.

443
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,279
(100 dollars)

444
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,619
You startled me. Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

445
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,190
(Oh Yoon Jin)

446
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,119
What did you talk about with Park Jun Seo
on February 22?

447
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,029
What?

448
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,559
Don't you remember?
You spoke with him on the phone...

449
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,700
on Thursday, February 22.

450
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,230
I'm asking what you talked about
with Jun Seo the day before he died.

451
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:47,009
(Missed call: Park Jun Seo)

452
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Yoon Jin.

453
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,390
I missed a call from him,
and then I forgot to call him back.

454
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:04,529
You forgot?

455
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,430
A friend you never talk to calls you
and you forget to call him back?

456
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,000
It can happen.

457
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,339
Also, I'm not like you
who cut ties with people.

458
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,410
I wouldn't say we kept in close touch,

459
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,309
but Jun Seo and I talked on the phone
every month or two.

460
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,250
I mean it.

461
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:27,849
Hey.

462
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,549
Are you here to offer condolences
or interrogate?

463
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,720
I heard Jun Seo took his own life.

464
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm already upset as it is.

465
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,690
And now you suddenly show up
and make a fuss.

466
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,559
(Late Park Jun Seo,
Spouse: Choi Ji Yeon)

467
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,039
Please retrieve your card.

468
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,109
What is this?

469
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,170
- Thank you for using our service.
- I have to do it all over?

470
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:54,539
(Rest in peace)

471
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,980
(Room 1)

472
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,630
Are you here to offer condolences?

473
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Yes.

474
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,269
No one is around right now.

475
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,539
They're over there.

476
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,420
(Observation Room)

477
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,029
Hey, where are you going?

478
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,329
- What is this?
- Stop.

479
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,599
What are you doing?

480
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,130
Who do you think you are
to behave this way?

481
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,329
I'm a detective. Please let me go.

482
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,339
"A detective?"

483
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,539
Hey, it's Jae Gyeong.

484
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,309
Jang Jae Gyeong.

485
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,410
"Jang Jae Gyeong?"

486
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,069
Please stop with the shrouding.

487
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,710
We'll perform an autopsy.

488
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,450
We need to conduct an autopsy.

489
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,950
Several things are suspicious
about Jun Seo's death.

490
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,180
Please give your consent for an autopsy.

491
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,720
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

492
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,259
Who are you to order an autopsy?

493
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,960
Who do you think you are? Come here.

494
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,599
Park Jun Seo's estimated time of death...

495
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,829
is between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:00 a.m. on February 23.

496
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,230
He fell from a construction site
in Pilo-dong...

497
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,640
which led to a fractured skull
and damaged organs.

498
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,099
- Jae Gyeong.
- This is the strange part.

499
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,140
Jun Seo's shoes were found
on the ninth floor which was assumed...

500
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,569
to be where he jumped.

501
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,980
But the elevator on-site wasn't
on the ninth floor, but the first.

502
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,279
What's so strange about that?

503
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,529
Jong Soo.

504
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,910
It's you, Jae Gyeong.

505
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,750
Long time no see.

506
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,079
It's me, Won Jong Soo.

507
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,019
Won Jong Soo at 10:10 p.m.

508
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,859
Has it been a while for you too?

509
00:30:58,930 --> 00:30:59,930
Yes.

510
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,430
It has been 20 years
since our high school days.

511
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,799
I'm Tae Jin.

512
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You remember me, don't you?

513
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,339
Last year, I joined the criminal division
of Anhyun's district prosecutor's office.

514
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:09,710
- We're finally meeting.
- Park Tae Jin at 10:18 p.m.

515
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,779
I guess people are bound to meet
if they're alive.

516
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,480
Oh Chi Hyun at 10:30 p.m.

517
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,690
Why did you perform
the postmortem examination?

518
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,359
What?

519
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,369
I had the time.

520
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,069
A deputy chief prosecutor had the time?

521
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,170
Are you sure it wasn't because
it was Park Jun Seo?

522
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,309
These days, even deputy chief prosecutors
must go when they're told.

523
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:45,309
By the way,

524
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,910
is it strange for a prosecutor
to go for a postmortem examination?

525
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,720
Fine. Let's forget about that.

526
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,319
What did you think during the examination?

527
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:58,819
Jang Jae Gyeong.

528
00:31:58,819 --> 00:31:59,819
I said, what did you think?

529
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,700
Let's stop.

530
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,970
This is not the place for it.

531
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:11,930
What made you conclude it was a suicide?

532
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,069
Tae Jin is telling you to stop!

533
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:16,809
Yoon Ho.

534
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,579
We're sending our friend away.

535
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:23,410
Do you need to make such a fuss?

536
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,019
Did you find any footprints
on the stairway to the ninth floor?

537
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,480
I was told no footprints...

538
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,720
on the construction site stairs matched...

539
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,750
the shoes Jun Seo was wearing.

540
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:33,690
What made you think
it was a suicide despite that?

541
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,529
Because the circumstances say so.

542
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:37,859
"Circumstances?"

543
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,559
Jun Seo's daughter, Yoon Hee.

544
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,730
When she passed away
after he cared for her for six years,

545
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,029
he was broken.

546
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,799
He couldn't do anything.

547
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,440
Every day was torture for him.

548
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:50,769
He even went to a psychiatrist
to treat his depression.

549
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,509
That's enough, okay?

550
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,349
You must be doing this
because you don't know his situation.

551
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,650
We're just as upset as you are.

552
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,359
He left in such a dire way.

553
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,920
There's no reason to cut him up.

554
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,059
Let's finish shrouding.

555
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:11,430
We can talk outside after.

556
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Please continue.

557
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,160
Okay, everyone out.

558
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,369
Don't move!

559
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,640
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

560
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Hey.

561
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,309
You guys are a joke.

562
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,910
Didn't Jun Seo tell you
why he wanted to commit suicide...

563
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,980
before he jumped?

564
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,319
Are you really convinced it was suicide
based on the circumstances?

565
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,359
Think about it.
You're all talking about circumstances,

566
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,089
but why won't any of you
mention the most important thing?

567
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,000
Well?

568
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,670
The people Jun Seo talked to
before he died.

569
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,140
Won Jong Soo.

570
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:54,269
Park Tae Jin.

571
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,769
Oh Chi Hyun.

572
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,009
The suspected time of suicide
is between 11:30 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.

573
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,339
He talked to you three after 10:10 p.m.

574
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:04,180
If Jun Seo really took his life,
what would he have said?

575
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,019
Wouldn't something have sounded off?

576
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,119
When I asked earlier
why you were so sure he'd killed himself,

577
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,519
the first thing you'd have said
was that he had called you.

578
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,360
Why are you all trying to hide that?

579
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,159
Hey!

580
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,460
What's your problem?

581
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,599
Why are you suddenly trying to be a cop?

582
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,800
Jeong Yoon Ho.

583
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:26,969
Stop it.

584
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,409
Why does that even matter right now?

585
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,679
Do you think there's something special
about Jun Seo calling us?

586
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,079
We...

587
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,349
We talked to each other
over ten times a day!

588
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,949
You got kicked out of school
trying to stab your friends in the back.

589
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:45,320
I can't believe you became a cop
only to act like you're invincible.

590
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,920
It's not "we."

591
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,659
- What?
- He didn't call you.

592
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,230
What? Do you feel left out?

593
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,530
Darn you.

594
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:57,869
Hey.

595
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,269
Jeong Yoon Ho.

596
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,539
Someone could've drugged Jun Seo
and pushed him.

597
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,210
Even if that were not the case,

598
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,449
deaths like this require
an autopsy 100 percent.

599
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,820
Why won't you do it?

600
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,889
Why are you trying to rush the funeral
without an autopsy?

601
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,320
Did Jun Seo say something on the phone?

602
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,420
What did he say that you're all like this?

603
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,659
Yes. He called.

604
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,559
I didn't know
he'd called Tae Jin or Chi Hyun.

605
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,860
He just asked how I was doing.

606
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,170
Since Yoon Hee's death,
he'd sounded so frail and glum,

607
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,469
and he did that night too.

608
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,739
I asked if I should buy him some tonic...

609
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:36,969
and told him to stay strong, that's all.

610
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,809
To me, that was the last chat...

611
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,980
with my friend Park Jun Seo.

612
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,849
I wanted to keep it to myself.

613
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,320
So I didn't mention it, okay?

614
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:50,550
Does that make sense?

615
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,559
Don't you think it's weird?

616
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:56,760
That one hour before taking his life,

617
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,059
Jun Seo called each of you
to ask how you were?

618
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,199
Who asked whom how they were doing?

619
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,969
Park Tae Jin, Oh Chi Hyun.

620
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,769
Did Jun Seo call you to catch up too?

621
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,199
Jang Jae Gyeong.

622
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,679
Get a grip.

623
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,909
Hey!

624
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,250
Be quiet! Please!

625
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,780
Stop it, all of you.

626
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,789
What are you doing
next to your friend's dead body?

627
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
Do you still call yourselves his friend?

628
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,769
Jun Seo...

629
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:37,969
didn't call me.

630
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,469
Whether it was to say hi or catch up,
you all got a call at least!

631
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,210
I didn't even get that!

632
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,889
(Vault 1, Park Jun Seo, February 26, 2024)

633
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,809
Do you have to do that
to make yourself feel better?

634
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,010
What do you mean?

635
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,139
Goodness.

636
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,449
I don't even know
why I'm sitting here with you.

637
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,090
They're the Major Leaguers.

638
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:09,829
My pathetic life's always in the Minors.

639
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,860
Come this way.

640
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,400
What is it?

641
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,869
You'll barge in there for round two?

642
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,099
I must get her to agree to an autopsy.

643
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,139
Hey.

644
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,110
Those guys practically lived together...

645
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,510
with Jun Seo for the last 20 years.

646
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,420
Look at them with the armbands.

647
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,280
They're practically family.

648
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,690
Darn it.

649
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,989
There's something you don't know.

650
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,559
The reason Jun Seo's daughter
lasted six years.

651
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:42,460
It was because Jong Soo
sent five grand a month...

652
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,260
for medicine and treatments.

653
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,630
Do you think that's a small sum?

654
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,699
So don't even mention...

655
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,500
an autopsy in front of them.

656
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,809
To be honest, I'm against it too.

657
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,909
He'll meet his daughter
when he crosses over.

658
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:01,340
If you were him,

659
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,980
would you want to show up
with a Y-cut on your chest?

660
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,420
The guy who punched me
was Jeong Yoon Ho, right?

661
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,829
Yes. Next to him is Kang Si Jung.

662
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,130
The class decorator.

663
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,769
- Do you remember?
- No.

664
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,099
You wouldn't.

665
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,440
Yoon Ho and Si Jung are married.

666
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:28,369
They started dating in college.

667
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,170
On his other side is Jeong Sang Eui.

668
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,909
You remember him, right?

669
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,079
You wouldn't know anyone.

670
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,150
I guess...

671
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,650
you stayed in touch with them.

672
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,150
No. I didn't see them often.

673
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,789
I talk to Si Jung sometimes.

674
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,059
The others, I haven't seen in a while.

675
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,829
I don't go to the reunions.

676
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,630
Do you think so too?

677
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,199
That Jun Seo killed himself...

678
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,539
over the pain of losing his daughter?

679
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,110
I think it's possible.

680
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,650
Now that I'm a mom,

681
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,050
I don't think I could live
if my kid died first.

682
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,829
- Move over.
- Okay.

683
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,730
Jong Soo. Sit over here.

684
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,900
- Hey.
- Sit here.

685
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,969
- Jong Soo.
- Hi.

686
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,030
Thanks for coming.

687
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,670
Hey, this isn't working.
I should be over there.

688
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:40,340
That's where I belong.

689
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,340
I just dropped off a flower arrangement.

690
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,079
Leave it outside, then.

691
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,349
Can you sign for it?

692
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,349
Darn it.

693
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Okay.

694
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,090
It's from Joo Song.

695
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,889
(Signed for by: Oh Yoon Jin)

696
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,929
(From Twostar Holdings, Heo Joo Song)

697
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,030
What is "Twostar?"

698
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,630
Is he a division commander?

699
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,610
He'll cling to and bother me
if he shows up.

700
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,639
Shoot.

701
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,710
- Hey.
- Long time no see.

702
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,510
Jong Soo, it has been so long.

703
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:24,989
Hey.

704
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,159
I'm sorry about earlier.

705
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,860
Could you consider...

706
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,889
- doing the autopsy...
- Are you going somewhere?

707
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,260
Yes.

708
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,829
I'm going home to get some stuff.

709
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,170
I left in a daze and hurry earlier.

710
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,000
How will go get there?

711
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,070
I'll take a taxi and make a quick trip.

712
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,170
I'll drive you.

713
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,239
You shouldn't take a taxi today.

714
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,809
I didn't drink.

715
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,409
It's fine.

716
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,420
Well, we all have a reason
to want to leave.

717
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,250
If you see Heo Joo Song, tell him I left.

718
00:41:57,619 --> 00:41:59,460
I'm not in the mood
to put up with his excitement.

719
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,789
Let's go.

720
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,320
(Ten dollars)

721
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,559
(March 2004)

722
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,869
Hey, Judo guy.

723
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,900
The teacher wants to see you
in the office.

724
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,170
Are you adjusting to the new class?

725
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:53,179
Is anything hard
since you started 11th grade?

726
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,880
- No.
- I see.

727
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,719
Your father is
Education Officer Jang Tae Jung, isn't he?

728
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,250
Right?

729
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,260
The reason...

730
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,860
why you were assigned to my class
since starting the 11th grade...

731
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,360
was because Education Officer Jang
has become your new father.

732
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,099
You know that, don't you?

733
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:17,929
Right?

734
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,739
Also,

735
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:25,570
everyone is dying to join Class Six,
you know?

736
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,639
You know that very well too, don't you?

737
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,449
Let's get along.

738
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,380
- Good.
- Sir.

739
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,420
- Yes?
- I've gathered the student support fund.

740
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,679
Everyone paid, right?

741
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,320
- Not yet.
- Who is it?

742
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:40,960
Everyone paid except for him.

743
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,659
Hey, you should've explained to him well.

744
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,659
He doesn't know
because it's his first time here.

745
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,000
In order to help students in need
continue their studies,

746
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,840
everyone in the class volunteered.

747
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,710
They volunteered to collect these funds.

748
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,739
You don't have to pay
if you don't want to.

749
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,079
You should collect money
like you're supposed to.

750
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,650
Sorry, sir.

751
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:11,949
All right.

752
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:13,289
Good.

753
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,420
All right. Get going.

754
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,590
Yes, sir.

755
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:25,829
Today,

756
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:29,170
your school's principal
and homeroom teacher came to see me.

757
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,639
You've never once called me Father,

758
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,739
but I guess you said...

759
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,210
that I was your father at school.

760
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,480
There's a kid in your class
named Won Jong Soo.

761
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,050
Be good friends with him.

762
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,519
Buy your friends some food too.

763
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:59,969
In order to help students in need
continue their studies,

764
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:02,840
everyone in the class volunteered.

765
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,489
It's the class president.

766
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,690
He's suspended.

767
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,159
(Class 3-6, Park Jun Seo,
suspended for 1 week)

768
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,260
A week is a bit harsh.

769
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,760
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

770
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,530
Among you,

771
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,559
someone...

772
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,869
sent an anonymous letter...

773
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,070
to the superintendent's office.

774
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:37,039
The student support fund
that you voluntarily collected...

775
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,340
is an act of bribery.

776
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,340
I guess that's what the letter said.

777
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:45,280
I won't make it long.

778
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,780
Now,

779
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,519
we won't be collecting
the student support fund anymore.

780
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,320
Also, to take responsibility
for this incident,

781
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,920
the class president has been suspended
for a week.

782
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,099
(Reduce food waste and increase recycling)

783
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,469
(Park Jun Seo)

784
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:09,070
Do you have to do this too
when you get suspended?

785
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,010
Here.

786
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:22,780
Did you come to apologize or something?

787
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,159
Did you think one anonymous letter...

788
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,219
would get your stepfather fired
as an Education Officer...

789
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,460
and our homeroom teacher out of a job?

790
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,789
Did you expect that kind of happy ending?

791
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,570
What will happen to you now?

792
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,639
Is it hard for you to attend school
without the student support fund?

793
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,809
Hey, that student support fund
wasn't even that much money.

794
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,380
It's enough for me
to watch out for Jong Soo.

795
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,320
Having to mind all the other kids
just because I received that fund...

796
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
wasn't fun for me either.

797
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,650
I'm rather glad.

798
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,519
You shouldn't mind it either.

799
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,190
Anyway,

800
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
sorry.

801
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,199
I didn't know
things would end up like this.

802
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,630
Worry about your own future.

803
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:15,739
You must've been prepared
when you made things this bad.

804
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:22,139
Our homeroom teacher and Jong Soo
seemed to have their eyes set on you.

805
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,710
Will you be okay?

806
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,119
I'm off.

807
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,360
I'm rather glad too.

808
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,530
I'm a psycho who got a friend suspended.

809
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,730
Now, everyone knows that.

810
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:43,730
I doubt anyone would say anything to me...

811
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,530
just because
I don't tiptoe around somebody.

812
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Crazy punk.

813
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:52,670
You seriously must be crazy.

Excuse me.

I'm Joo Song. Heo Joo Song.

820
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,969
- Hey.
- What on earth happened to Jun Seo?

821
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,829
Hey, Chi Hyun.

822
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,170
Right.

823
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,139
Let's say our goodbyes.

824
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:22,929
I'll be back soon.

825
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:24,630
No, take your time.

(Visitors, please check in
at the security office.)

827
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,349
Goodness. She already went up.

828
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,079
Who?

829
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,050
Yoon Hee's mother just went up, right?

830
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,050
Yes.

831
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,829
- Why?
- But there must've been a funeral.

832
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:52,630
I thought I saw her
wearing mourning clothes.

833
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,099
Oh, yes.

My goodness.

838
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:08,340
By the way, what's this?

839
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:09,539
Oh, this?

840
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,250
It's a registered mail that arrived
a few days ago.

841
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,119
I haven't delivered it to them yet.

842
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,650
Gosh, I think it was for Yoon Hee's dad.

843
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,050

844

848
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,300
pretty out of it right now.
I'll hand it to her.

849
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,230

so materialistic?

since it's her privacy.

You knew she used to work
for Daehan Daily, right?

885
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,809
- Did she?
- Yes.

886
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,539
She was new in the field,
but she received recognition.

887
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,650
But you know what she's like.

888
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,750
She didn't edit her story
like she was told...

889
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,449
and just published it,
so she had to quit her job.

890
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:33,420
The following year,
she married a Korean guy from Canada...

891
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,590
who worked at a stock firm
and had her daughter Ye Eun.

892

And?

893
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,230
Maybe two years or so
after Ye Eun was born, they divorced.

894
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:45,730
Her ex-husband took their daughter
to Canada.

895

896
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,639
this jerk...

doesn't seem to be earning any money.

898
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,409
He seems to be living off...

899
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,909
of the child support
Yoon Jin sends every month.

900
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,880
- Why?
- How should I know?

901
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:02,750
Anyway,

902
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,250
Yoon Jin would do anything
if it was for Ye Eun.

903
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:08,260
I think she knows what's going on,

904
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,389
but she's still trying to make more money
to send over.

905
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:13,429
But you and I both know
how much local reporters make.

906
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,039
Jae Gyeong, hey...

907
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,409
Didn't Jun Seo come visit you recently?

908
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,780
- He did, right?
- How did you know that?

909
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,789
I guess he did.

910
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:39,420
What did he say?
Did he say anything in particular?

911
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,059
Like what? What do you know?

912
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,829
I'm telling you this because it's you.

913
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,699
It's really uncomfortable to be here.

914
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,440
Why is that?

915
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,340
About a week ago,

916
00:53:56,969 --> 00:53:58,409
Jun Seo came to see me.

917
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:01,409
He wanted to sign up for a life insurance.

918
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:03,809
Just a minute.

919
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,679
Next week Wednesday?

920
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:09,480
Sure. I'll see you then.

921
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:13,250
One medical billing insurance
and one cancer insurance.

922
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,489
Thank you.

923
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,860
Bye.

924
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,059
Let's see...

925
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,400
You look busy.

926
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,269
What?

927
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:30,440
- Life insurance?
- Yes.

928
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,909
He signed up for a few other packages
with me before,

929
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:37,550
but he suddenly visited me
and signed up for three life insurance.

930
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,980
But, under the name of his company.

931
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:40,250
"His company?"

932
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,750
He told me he founded a company.

933
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:46,150
Darn him. He left in just a week.

934
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,460
Wait.

935
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,429
He can't get any insurance money
if it's a suicide, right?

936
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,789
Right.

937
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,659
I told him...

938
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,530
he wouldn't get any payment
if he committed suicide within two years.

939
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,539
But...

940
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,539
this is where it gets really strange.

941
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:08,280
After signing up for the insurance,

942
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,750
he asked me to see a lawyer with him.

943
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,610
- "A lawyer?"
- Yes.

944
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:19,489
Please give me your attention
for a moment.

945
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,659
On behalf of Jun Seo's family,
I want to thank all of you...

946
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,400
for seeing Jun Seo off.

947
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Before...

948
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,739
Jun Seo died,

949
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,510
he left a will.

950
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,610
On February 16, 2024,

951
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,780
which was a week before Jun Seo's death,

952
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,380
he met with CEO Heo Joo Song
from Twostar Holdings...

953
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,090
to sign up for life insurance
with Jungho Life, Heungin Life,

954
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,760
and Jangsoo Life for amounts
1 million, 2 million, and 2 million...

955
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,360
for a total of five million dollars...

956
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,260
under the name
of his fully-owned corporation,

957
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,730

958
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:13,679
(Anhyun University Hospital, Park Jun Seo)

959
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,019
Darn it.

960
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,099
What is this?

961
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:40,400
"The insured: Park Jun Seo"

962
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,440
"Beneficiary..."

963
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,769
(Beneficiary: Audio File)

964
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,170
"Audio File?"

965
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:50,309
Wait...

966
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,219
(Amount insured: Two million dollars)

967
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,250
"Two million dollars?"

968
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,260
(Beneficiary: Audio File, Park Jun Seo)

969
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,159
"Audio File?"

971
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,780
(Law Firm Ohjung)

972
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,780
And...

973
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,579
on this will,

974
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:31,190
he indicated the legatee
of his company's full shares...

975
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,789
and the beneficiary
of the five million dollars.

983
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
"and Oh Yoon Jin..."

"in equally divided portions."

985

(Connection)

987
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:46,860
The students' creed.

988
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,329
One.

989
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:50,869
Be someone who performs one's duty.

990
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,230
Two.

991
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,840
Be true to one's goal.

992
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,869
Three.

993
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:58,710
Be a helping hand to a friend.

994
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,380
All right. Come in.

995
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,949
They're our new transfer students.

996
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,119
Let's welcome them with applause.

997

(Park Jun Seo)

998
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,829
Go ahead and say hello.

999
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,199
Hey, I'm Oh Yoon Jin.

1000
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,030
I hope we get along.

(Jang Jae Gyeong)

1002
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,539
I'm Heo Joo Song.

1003
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,369
I look forward to getting to know you.

1004
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,880
Help them adjust, okay?

1005
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

1006
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,280
Okay, you two.

1007
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,150
That's our students' creed.

1008
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,119
I'll check if you memorized them
by the end of the day,

1009
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:46,190
so make sure you get them down.

1010
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,690
All right?

1011
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,730
Now, your seats.

1012
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,860
Sir.

1013
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,030
I have a question.

1014
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:57,769
"Be a helping hand to a friend."

1015
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,869
Did you come up with this one?

1016
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,710
- What?
- I find it strange.

1017
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,639
Do all friends have to be helpful?

1018
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,349
Whether we're helpful
to one another or not,

1019
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:13,079
you should encourage us
to get along as friends.

1020
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,019
What?

1021
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,820
You agree with me, don't you?

1022
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,360
If it's okay, should I change it?

1023
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:24,429
Gosh.

1024
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:14,909
(Connection)

1025
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:17,949
Why didn't you discuss it with me
if you knew there was a will?

1026
01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:19,250
So it wasn't a suicide?

1027
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,820
Did someone kill my husband?

1028
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,619
- It's better to perform an autopsy.
- Hey.

1029
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,219
Too many things are suspicious.

1030
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:25,690
Are you doing this
because you want the insurance money?

1031
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,059
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- Don't you dare say my name.

1032
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:30,530
I'm here as a prosecutor,
not as your friend.

1033
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,230
What are you trying to hide
by going this far?

1034
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,900
It's a clear proof of murder.

1035
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,469
We won't last forever like this.

1036
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,670
"Lemon Mulberry?"

1037
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,670
It's that drug again.

1038
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,800
You can't take me to a hospital.

1039
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,039
How could you use drugs?

1040
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,670
I can't do without it.

1041
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:47,840
Come to your senses, Jae Gyeong!

1042
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,210
Open the door.

1043
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,980
Wake up, Jang Jae Gyeong!
