00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,179
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,119
I'll carry your bag.

3
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:14,689
Thank you.

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,089
Didn't that feel great?

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,190
Yes, but it's so illogical.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,829
We should've watched "Crying Fist."

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,699
It still helped me de-stress.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,870
But you never get stressed.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,829
What did you say?

10
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,670
- Hey, Sang Eui.
- Am I wrong?

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,799
Did something happen?

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,140
Okay, I'll be right there.

13
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,939
What is it?

14
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,850
Hey, I'll get going.

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,579
Hey! Where are you going?

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Hey!

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Jun Seo.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
Isn't...

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,630
Isn't this Kyung Tae's house?

20
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,869
Where is he?

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,700
- Where's Kyung Tae?
- Wait.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,969
Let me go.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,840
Where's Kyung Tae?

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,480
Where is he?

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,879
You can't go in.

26
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,579
It's already...

27
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,920
It's already too late.

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,219
Move. Kyung Tae!

29
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,590
It was an accident, Jun Seo.
Just an accident.

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,420
We must find safety!

31
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,920
Let go! Chae Kyung Tae! Hey, Kyung Tae!

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,359
Let go of me!

33
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,060
Chae Kyung Tae!

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,900
Chae Kyung Tae!

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,530
No... Let go.

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,969
I said, let go. Hey!

37
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,340
(Connection)

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,870
It's me.

39
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,439
Jeong Yoon Ho
was near my apartment just now.

40
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,069
I don't know which road he took,

41
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,909
and I think he's using
public transport other than a taxi.

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,240
He just used a payphone.

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Track the number.

44
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,740
Hang on.

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,580
The number is 031-0325-7898.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Yes, thanks.

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,729
What are these photos?

48
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,270
I'll explain.

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,400
I'll explain.

50
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,340
I'll explain. Give me my phone.

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,340
Talk to me.

52
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,740
I told someone to follow Choi Ji Yeon.

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,810
That's how I found out
she was seeing Tae Jin.

54
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,379
That's how I got these photos.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Are you insane?

56
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:02,650
What if Tae Jin were to find out?

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,520
I told you.
He could be behind all of this.

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,789
And Yoon Ho is now a suspected murderer.

59
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,300
Don't you get that?

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,629
I got it.

61
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,729
One verse is enough.

62
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,439
Choi Ji Yeon.

63
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,069
Is your tail still on her?

64
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,710
- Yes.
- Let's go.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
We're leaving?

66
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,620
(Episode 10)

67
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,810
(Kim Woo Sung)

68
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,379
Where are you?

69
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,409
Put it on speaker.

70
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,580
I'm at Cossack. CW went in on her own.

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Follow her inside.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,849
I'm about to.

73
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

74
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,719
- What?
- Can you get a recording?

75
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,189
It's okay. We're on our way there.

76
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,090
Yes, I can.

77
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,930
If Park Tae Jin shows up,
tape their conversation.

78
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,500
Don't do anything else. Just wait.

79
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,060
Okay.

80
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,000
Where is Cossack?

81
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,529
It's on Hwansung's cafe street.

82
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,600
- I'll find it for you.
- Okay.

83
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,740
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,740
What does CW stand for?

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,379
What? Oh, that?

86
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,879
It's Choi Ji Yeon's nickname.

87
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,410
Why is she CW?

88
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,879
You don't need to know.
Follow this route to the cafe.

89
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,589
- Welcome.
- Hello.

90
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,290
I'll have an iced Americano.

91
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,290
Okay.

92
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,970
Woo Sung.

93
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,779
- Yoon Jin.
- Hi.

94
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,250
Hello. I'm Kim Woo Sung
with Anhyun Economic Daily.

95
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,250
Put it on.

96
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,250
Okay.

97
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,689
Do you have anything?

98
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,220
What did Jae Gyeong say?

99
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,389
I want to ask you something first.

100
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,189
Oh Yoon Jin.

101
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,730
What did she have with Jun Seo?

102
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:00,600
Did they date?

103
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,540
Did they?

104
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,569
You don't know?

105
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,870
I think they briefly did in high school.

106
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,480
Why do you want to know that?

107
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,279
Did something happen earlier?

108
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,750
How did they get together?

109
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,720
Oh Yoon Jin was a transfer.

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,589
I think she joined
Jun Seo's music-listening club.

111
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,490
What is this about?

112
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,920
They dated back then?

113
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,560
How long were they together?

114
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,500
I don't know. I barely remember.

115
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,160
They dated for a bit...

116
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,199
before breaking up over something.

117
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,870
What something?

118
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,300
Something happened.

119
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,569
Jae Gyeong got transferred
and the music club disbanded.

120
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,480
I think that's how they broke up.

121
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,810
That's it.

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,680
What did they say that you're like this?

123
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,850
What about recently?

124
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,689
Did Jun Seo...

125
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,519
mention Oh Yoon Jin before he died?

126
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,720
- Ji Yeon.
- Did he?

127
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,560
Keep your voice down.
What are you doing?

128
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,540
You called me over
at this hour to ask me that?

129
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,810
Is this that important?

130
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Yes.

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,850
It's important.

132
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,649
As far as I know, nothing happened...

133
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,620
between those two.

134
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,060
If you keep asking about that,
I have nothing more to tell you.

135
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,529
All three of them seemed to be wary of me,

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
so I didn't find out anything else.

137
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,529
We'll go to Boryeong together soon.

138
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,170
I'll get something then.

139
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,540
Did they seem clueless...

140
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,709
about Boryeong?

141
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes.

142
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,379
Stay close to them if possible.

143
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,019
You're leaving?

144
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,649
My family's waiting at home.

145
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,259
And...

146
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:08,589
I'd like you to make up your mind
before this weekend.

147
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:11,899
Once this weekend is over, that money...

148
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,870
means nothing to me.

149
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,839
Why is that?

150
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,339
Tell me when you've decided.

151
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,889
As soon as she left,
she called Tae Jin over...

152
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,559
just to ask him if you dated Jun Seo?

153
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,019
I guess so.

154
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,889
I can't figure her out at all.

155
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,769
What?

156
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,039
You have all the conversations
between Tae Jin and Choi Ji Yeon, right?

157
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,009
Do I? I don't know.

158
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,940
Do we have them?

159
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,509
I kept some...

160
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,950
and deleted others.

161
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,350
What did they talk about mostly?

162
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,779
As if they did much talking.

163
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,490
They went straight to motels.

164
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,789
You don't know
because you didn't date much.

165
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:12,789
Oh Yoon Jin.

166
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,629
What?

167
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,360
You knew this wasn't the first time
they'd met at this cafe.

168
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,399
What did they talk about?

169
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,870
They really didn't talk about much.

170
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,940
They had the typical
cheating couple conversations.

171
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,440
"Get a divorce." "I can't do that."

172
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,639
"Let's leave together." "I don't want to."

173
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,610
- Is that true?
- Yes.

174
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,179
What's the money about, then?

175
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,610
Tae Jin said the money...

176
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,379
meant nothing to him
once this weekend was over.

177
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,179
Is that topic new to you?

178
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,250
Yes.

179
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:45,990
Maybe those two invested in a company.

180
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,330
Even if we don't get the password,

181
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,129
Tae Jin might say...

182
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,600
what the account is and how much is in it.

183
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,580
(Anhyeon Police Station)

184
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,179
I checked the CCTV of the area
you mentioned yesterday...

185
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,450
and got nothing.

186
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,750
He hasn't left Anhyun yet.

187
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,190
He might not leave at all.

188
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,120
What about Kang Si Jung's interrogation?

189
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,190
I asked if she knew of
any places for him to hide,

190
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,200
but she wouldn't answer.

191
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:26,159
Send her home...

192
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,730
and have people watch the area.

193
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:28,929
Okay.

194
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,470
Did you run the payphone number?

195
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:31,769
We'll get the results soon.

196
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:35,970
Hey.

197
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,110
Hello, Unit Chief.

198
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,450
Straw.

199
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,320
(Written Statement)

200
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,049
What does all this say?

201
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,419
It says Lee Geun Ho...

202
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,720
drove the car you asked about.

203
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,690
- Lee Geun Ho?
- Yes.

204
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,289
He's a kid from the suburbs
who used to drive girls to bars.

205
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,730
He recently came into a lot of money...

206
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,129
and took up swinging a golf club...

207
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,000
as well as spending way more.

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Is that all?

209
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:08,070
Would that be all?
If you look at the bottom,

210
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,039
you can see Lee Geun Ho's address,

211
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,740
"Join-dong 18-49?"

212
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,779
Was anyone hurt in the process?

213
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,419
I'm not sure what you mean by "hurt."

214
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,389
Did anyone end up in the ER?

215
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,590
Oh, in the ER?
No one went to the ER.

216
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,090
Most of them were quite cooperative.

217
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,690
Good job.

218
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Does that mean...

219
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,330
I have nothing to do with the case now?

220
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,529
What?

221
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,730
I'm off scot-free?

222
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,399
What?

223
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,570
You have that look again.

224
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,509
(Written Statement)

225
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,950
(Written Statement)

226
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,490
Join-dong, 18-49.

227
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,389
You thought we wouldn't know
if you didn't tell us, didn't you?

228
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,289
We're going to go to this address now.

229
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,759
I was wondering if you had anything
you wanted to say to us.

230
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
- I don't.
- You don't?

231
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,429
- That's right.
- Okay.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,970
Oh, right.
Do you know who is sitting next to you?

233
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,080
He's the actual owner
of the car you used to drive.

234
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,279
This is a connection too.
Why don't you two say hello?

235
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,450
Hello.

236
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,279
You only have a famous nickname
and not a famous face, don't you?

237
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,549
Introduce yourself.

238
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,980
Darn it... Straw?

239
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,879
Eleven years ago,
this guy alone went to see...

240
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,919
An Hyung Sik, the boss of the largest gang
in Western Seoul.

241
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,120
Of course,
his body was thoroughly searched,

242
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,259
so he went into the room...

243
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,730
with An Hyung Sik and five of his men
pretty much in the nude.

244
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,559
In that room, just like now,

245
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,470
were six cups of iced Americanos.

246
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,330
When I got the call
and arrived at the scene,

247
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,570
the six men who were in that room...

248
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,539
had all died
of ruptured carotid arteries.

249
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,940
This guy was covered in blood
and sitting there...

250
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,480
with no intention of running away.

251
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,350
And in his hand,
there was a single straw.

252
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,519
After that, everyone called him Straw.

253
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,960
Come here.

254
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:40,889
Listen carefully.

255
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,990
You have just made the legendary Straw...

256
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,659
into the suspect of a mere drug case
on the outskirts of town.

257
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,399
Look at his face.

258
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,740
You've just gotten yourself into
a very awkward spot.

259
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,399
Also,

260
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,440
we're going to go to this address now.

261
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:59,340
Everyone will think you gave us
this information.

262
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,539
So, you'll become a traitor too.

263
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,450
If you still insist
that it was a solo act,

264
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,779
we intend to accept that too.

265
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,549
What will you do?

266
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,690
But...

267
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,419
What?

268
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,330
Send him over to the prosecution
for grand theft auto...

269
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,200
and violation
of the Narcotics Control Act.

270
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,799
Wait!

271
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,769
But it wasn't me.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,399
It really wasn't me.

273
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,669
How would a guy like me
do something like this alone?

274
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,269
The name of the guy I was with was...

275
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,779
- Lee...
- Lee Geun Ho?

276
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,049
No! It was Gong Jin Wook!

277
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,480
Gong Jin Wook.

278
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,950
Our big boss' name is Gong Jin Wook.

279
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,490
He told us to do everything.

280
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,620
Is this Gong Jin Wook?

281
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes, that's right.

282
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,590
Is Gong Jin Wook the Doctor?

283
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,789
No, the Doctor just makes the drugs.

284
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,230
We only distribute it.

285
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,899
Have you seen the Doctor?

286
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,100
No, I'm sure even the big boss
hasn't seen the Doctor either.

287
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,470
The Doctor tends to stay hidden.

288
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,000
Where does Gong Jin Wook live?

289
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm not sure...
No, I really don't know!

290
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,440
Only Geun Ho knows
where the big boss lives.

291
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,139
What about CEO Yoon?

292
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,879
You know CEO Yoon, the distributor, right?

293
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,149
Yes.

294
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,019
Most of our products get distributed
on the market through CEO Yoon.

295
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,179
Where is CEO Yoon?

296
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,059
I'm not sure about that either.

297
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,330
What is it you do know?

298
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,759
You didn't even know anything,
yet you didn't cooperate until now...

299
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,000
and kept joking around with us?

300
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,070
But I really don't know anything.

301
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,669
Darn it.

302
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,509
Sorry.

303
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,240
Run a background check on Gong Jin Wook,

304
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
- and try to find his location.
- Yes, sir.

305
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,350
But Lee Geun Ho is
probably not home, right?

306
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:42,779
Look into Gong Jin Wook first,

307
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,320
and if that doesn't work,
let's go to Lee Geun Ho's place.

308
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,580
Yes, sir.

309
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,049
- Where are you going?
- I have somewhere to go.

310
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,250
Let me know right away
if you locate Gong Jin Wook.

311
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,289
Got it, sir.

312
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,629
Check your balance
and choose a transaction.

313
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,070
Thank you for doing business with us.

314
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,210
- Yes.
- Jin Wook.

315
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,149
Today is collection day.

316
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,950
I told you not to worry about that.
Just lie low.

317
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,549
I've always done this.
Why are you so worried?

318
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,460
I mean,
if the police really were after us,

319
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,559
we would need some money
to hide ourselves.

320
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,129
I'll go and get the money today.

321
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,889
No. Listen to me.

322
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,500
If CEO Yoon finds out Dae Sung was caught,
we'll be in trouble too.

323
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,830
How would CEO Yoon know that?

324
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,269
And Dae Sung doesn't know anything
besides my address.

325
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,909
Lee Geun Ho. Listen to what I say.

326
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,340
I'll come up with a way.

327
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,309
Don't do anything and just lie low.

328
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,909
Jin Wook.

329
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,279
Darn it.

330
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,329
What did the directors say?

331
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,960
So, you should do your job...

332
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,430
and make sure they don't say
anything weird, you punk.

333
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,430
Seriously.

334
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,109
You're busy.

335
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,640
Okay, hang up.

336
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,349
Who let someone into my room
when I wasn't even here?

337
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,319
What brings you here?
You didn't even call ahead.

338
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,289
Hey, be more amicable.

339
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,829
The mood is so scary
that I don't know what to say first.

340
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,500
Do you want some tea?

341
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,569
You heard what I said to Chi Hyun, right?

342
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
Well...

343
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,609
I heard you knew that we were all there
on the night Jun Seo died.

344
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,380
So what?

345
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,680
Do you need me to confirm the facts too?

346
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,690
I looked through Lee Myung Guk's logs,
and there was a lot of interesting stuff.

347
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,519
Youngryun Cold Storage.

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,690
Lee Myung Guk made pills there
and sold them, right?

349
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,859
And you had
Jun Seo deliver the pills to you.

350
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,569
How many pills do you take?

351
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
What?

352
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:22,109
Well, I'm just curious.
How many do you take?

353
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,250
But what caused the falling out
between you and Lee Myung Guk?

354
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,920
Did Lee Myung Guk ask for
too much money for the pills?

355
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,289
Did you make Yoon Ho do it?
To kill Lee Myung Guk?

356
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,059
What utter nonsense are you spewing?

357
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,430
No.

358
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,259
It would've been hard for Yoon Ho
to move a body by himself.

359
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,470
Hey.

360
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,200
You did it with him, didn't you?

361
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,940
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

362
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,569
Both the guy who made the pills
and the guy who delivered them died.

363
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,079
Now, there's only you left,
the guy who took the pills.

364
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,910
Doesn't that mean we have the answer?

365
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,279
Did you have them both killed?

366
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,519
- Hey!
- Isn't it true?

367
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,349
I didn't!

368
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
I didn't.

369
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,529
Guys who have nothing in their hands
are always full of talk.

370
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,690
Hey.

371
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,799
If you had something,

372
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,799
you wouldn't be sitting here
running your mouth.

373
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:24,769
Why?

374
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,569
"I killed Lee Myung Guk,"

375
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,039
"and I also killed Park Jun Seo."

376
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,309
Do you want me to say that?

377
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,579
I have no interest in getting confessions.

378
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:43,619
I just came because I was curious
and wanted to see...

379
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,720
how flustered you'd get at what I say...

380
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,759
and how anxious you'd be after I leave.

381
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,430
But when I come back,

382
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,240
I'll be sure to put handcuffs
on your wrists.

383
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,069
I'm off.

384
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,039
Bye.

385
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,579
Where have you been?

386
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,349
Nearby.

387
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,789
What about the taxi?
Did you take care of it?

388
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,890
I hid it well.

389
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,630
Give me what you have to give me.

390
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,240
You can't call anyone else with this.

391
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,769
You can only talk to me on this phone.

392
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,910
Got it.

393
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:15,410
Hey, but what proof did
Jang Jae Gyeong have...

394
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,809
to come after me?

395
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,220
- We don't know yet.
- You don't know?

396
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,789
Hey, Tae Jin.
I'm not the only one in a rush, am I?

397
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,359
You should step up to help.

398
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:28,690
What's your plan from now on?

399
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,829
Nothing.

400
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,900
You should come up with one for me.
That's what we always did.

401
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:38,500
Chi Hyun and I make the moves,
and you use your brain.

402
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:41,269
Gosh.

403
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,640
Shouldn't you be especially thankful
to me?

404
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,250
Don't be so cold-hearted, Tae Jin.

405
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:53,779
You were the one who said...

406
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,049
whether I did it knowingly or not,

407
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,589
burning the security camera server...

408
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,930
allowed what happened that day
to remain under wraps.

409
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,630
If anyone murdered Jun Seo...

410
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,170
and staged it as a suicide,

411
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,640
you're the only one I can think of.

412
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:15,869
What?

413
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,940
Jong Soo is softhearted,

414
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,109
though he might be immature.

415
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,849
Chi Hyun might beat people,

416
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:25,180
but he's not cruel enough
to give someone a disability.

417
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,849
But you're different.

418
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:31,150
When it's really necessary, you'll do it.

419
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,859
It looked like...

420
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,289
it would've been necessary this time.

421
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:42,000
If Jun Seo had found out
about your affair with his wife, that is.

422
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,970
Right?

423
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,170
I burned that security footage,

424
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,240
and you were probably on it too.

425
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,710
Luckily, we weren't caught.
Am I wrong?

426
00:22:58,349 --> 00:22:59,349
Yoon Ho.

427
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,579
Yes?

428
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,690
You really shouldn't use your head
like you just said.

429
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,859
More than that, don't jump to conclusions.

430
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,630
Otherwise, you'll kick the bucket sooner.

431
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,430
All right.

432
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I plan to do just that.

433
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,599
I'll keep my mouth shut...

434
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,799
and do as you say.

435
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,140
Please look after me.

436
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,289
Yes?

437
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,960
Gong Jin Wook is 34 years old.

438
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,089
He has two criminal records,

439
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,230
one for assault
and one for assisting prostitution.

440
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,029
He was arrested while running
an adult establishment.

441
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,430
He must've met Lee Geun Ho there.

442
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
I assume so.

443
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:54,069
But how did he ever get in touch
with a drug manufacturer like the Doctor?

444
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,640
It's all about networks in their world,

445
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,769
and they're in different lines of work.

446
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,009
You're right.
Kim Dae Sung also said...

447
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,210
that they were new to the job
and didn't have a distribution network.

448
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,650
They relied on 70 to 80 percent
of the sales on CEO Yoon.

449
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,819
Where are you right now?

450
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,789
I'm on my way to Lee Geun Ho's.

451
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,250
Do you want to meet me there?

452
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,119
Okay. What's the address?

453
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Wait.

454
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,859
The guy came.

455
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
Please head over right away.

456
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,160
I checked yesterday...

457
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,059
and found this on the tracks.

458
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,400
Usually,
people return to adjust the volume.

459
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,500
Chang Soo, now is not a good time.

460
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,309
Please check on your own
and report to me if you find anything.

461
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,569
Okay.

462
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,789
Can you say something?

463
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,690
Can you hear me well?

464
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
Yes.

465
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,630
Hey.

466
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,130
Are you a butcher?

467
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:54,329
No.

468
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,569
- Why do you ask?
- Well,

469
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,599
I smell something I usually do
when I go to a butcher's.

470
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,009
Are we finished?

471
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,190
We have to work on the other side.

472
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Give it to me.

473
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,349
- Gosh. I'm here.
- Hey.

474
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,720
Welcome. You're early.

475
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,990
Yes. I missed you.

476
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,190
Is Mr. Gong Jin Wook doing well?

477
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:57,160
Of course.

478
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,869
I'd like to count today's collection.

479
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
As you should. Hold on a minute.

480
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,319
What now?

481
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,819
Guess where I am.

482
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,589
Where?

483
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,890
CEO Yoon's office.

484
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,559
Didn't I tell you not to go there?
Why won't you listen?

485
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,700
We need to do what we must.

486
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,329
She's completely clueless.

487
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,140
She asked how you were doing.

488
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,109
- Geun Ho.
- Please don't worry.

489
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,579
I'll get the money and head over.

490
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,609
Get out of there right now.
Get out now.

491
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,509
Come on, brother. It's fine.

492
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,579
She went to get the money.

493
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,089
Geun Ho.

494
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,319

495

Here.

496
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,730
Should I go over,
or would you like to come here?

497
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:10,869
CEO Yoon.

498
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,670
Don't you dare lay a finger on Geun Ho
or I'll kill you.

499
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:14,869
Like I said,

500
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,869
should I go over,
or would you like to come here?

501
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:20,779
I'm coming.

502
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,009
Okay.

503
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,549
I want the burner phone
with the Doctor's contact...

504
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,180
in exchange for Geun Ho.

505
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:29,789
Put Geun Ho on the phone.

506
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,690
Well...

507
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,490
He won't last long.

508
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,289
You better get here within 30 minutes.

509
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:40,329
Darn it.

510
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,119
Here, try it out.

511
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,470
Gosh. I can hear well.

512
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,730
Then it's finished.

513
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,269

if there is another issue.

I searched just in case,
but it's not here.

518
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,049
By the way,

519
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,049
did this person ever visit here?

520
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,190
No.

521
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,190
All right. Thank you.

Sure.

523
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,920
I told him to take this off
before throwing it out.

524
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,190
He never listens.

00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,230

Did you see a man pass by just now?

00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,170
You came right on time.

546
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:51,609
Sir.

547
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,339
Did you ask the kid
with the hearing aid what his job was?

548
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,609
You haven't caught him yet?

549
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,009
Do you know what he does?

550
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,509
I didn't ask him that.

What are you doing here?

554
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,250
It's that way.

555
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,359
What happened?

556
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:49,869
Goodness.

557
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Was that a gunshot?

558
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,109
- Excuse us.
- Gosh.

559
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,569
Make way.

560
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,210
- It's dangerous. Step back.
- Okay.

561
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:00,640
Step aside.

Who are you?

570
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,769
Did you get me addicted?

571
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,010
Why?

572
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,679
Tell me.

573

- Did you call paramedics?
- Yes.

00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,159
What about Park Tae Jin?

No, stay with me.

Do you know Park Tae Jin?
Did he make you do it?

580
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,170
Talk to me.

581
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,239
Hey. Did you get me addicted?

582
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,679
Tell me. Who was it?

Come on.

584
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,349
Yes. I'll tell you
after I schedule a meeting.

585
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,090
We need to figure out
the password Park Tae Jin wants.

586
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,929
You don't know what Park Tae Jin's like.

587
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:32,730
He's going to make Choi Ji Yeon
tell him the password no matter what.

588
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,099
Even if we don't get the password,

589
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,269
Tae Jin might say what the account is...

590
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,340
and how much is in it.

591
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,750
- You're back.
- Yes.

away from the office.

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,000

When you said you sold insurance,

607
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,019
I wasn't sure you were even capable.

608
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,559
Will you clean up after yourself?

Hey. They're gifts for my clients.

- They're gifts?
- You can have one.

612

I'll mix one for you.

613
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,940

615
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,070
Yes, you actually do.

616
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,309
Why are you here?

617
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,309
What?

618
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,849
I came to ask you something.

619
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,519
Thanks.

620
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,929
What do you want to ask?

621
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,159
I don't know...

622
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,130
how to explain this.

623
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:21,570
- What if...
- Yoon Jin.

624
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,139
Saying "what if..."

625
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,780
and asking what I'd do in that situation.

626
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,110
Can you stop talking like that?

627
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,909
Is that what I always say?

628
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,849
The passcode.

629
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,960
It's your birthday, isn't it?

630
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,630
Zero, three, zero, five.

631
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,800
Yesterday, Ji Yeon...

632
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,070
Her dead husband used...

633
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,940
his ex-girlfriend's birthday
as a passcode...

634
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,940
and that's why...

635
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,440
she rushed to throw up.

636
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,809
And as soon as she met Tae Jin,

637
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,050
she asked him
about you and Jun Seo. Right?

638
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,380
How did you figure all that out?

639
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,190
The money must belong to
Tae Jin and Jun Seo,

640
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,849
but Jun Seo is dead.

641
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:14,489
Tae Jin needs to withdraw the money,

642
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,590
but he thinks
only Ji Yeon knows the passcode.

643
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,500
But the passcode is your birthday,

644
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:25,269
and the only two people in the world
who know that are you and Choi Ji Yeon.

645
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,340
No, there are three including me now.

646
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,969
How much do you know?

647
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,940
If what I said so far is right,

648
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,139
Yoon Jin.

649
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,610
Why did you come to see me?

650
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,889
The money.

651
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,699
Can't I have it?

652
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,559
You can't.

653
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,440
- Why not?
- You didn't earn it.

654
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,539
Okay.

655
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,309
I didn't earn it.

656
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,349
Do you think Tae Jin did, then?

657
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,820
Hey.

658
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,889
What do you think that means?

659
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,929
It means it's Jun Seo's money.

660
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:28,500
To let people like Tae Jin
and Ji Yeon have it...

661
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,730
when they stabbed him in the back.

662
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,170
Is that right?

663
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,699
It's like...

664
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,840
I found a treasure chest.

665
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,539
What's inside?

666
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,179
It's hard to prove whose it is,

667
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,849
and we don't know
how that money was earned.

668
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:46,119
It just belongs to whoever opens that box.

669
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,989
But it just turns out...

670
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,960
that the password to open
that box of treasures...

671
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,030
is my birthday.

672
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,530
Can I still not keep it?

673
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:04,929
If you think that way,
why did you come to me?

674
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,199
What did you want to hear?

675
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,179
(An insurance plan designed just for you!)

676
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,239
Yoon Jin.

677
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,780
You also think that this isn't right.

678
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:19,920
That was why you came to see me,

679
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,280
and you were hoping that I'd say
that it wasn't true.

680
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,690
No.

681
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,659
That I could keep it.

682
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,070
I was hoping to hear
that you'd tell me to keep that money.

683
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,059
Are you okay?

684
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:10,829
Yes.

685
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,400
Wait. One moment.

686
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,179
All right.

687
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,019
I found the CCTV files.

688
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:30,389
I'll watch them.

689
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,519
Oh, right.

690
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,099
So she was already dead when you got here?

691
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,730
And there weren't
any firearms at the scene?

692
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,300
- Is it CEO Yoon?
- Yes.

693
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,030
I'll check the identity.

694
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,940
They'll find out soon enough that
the wound is from a .38 caliber bullet.

695
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,309
Please let us know as soon as possible
when you get the analysis results.

696
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,139
Unit Chief.

697
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,639
Will you take a look at the CCTV footage?

698
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,210
Oh, let's go.

699
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,460
You also think that this isn't right.

700
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:45,929
That was why you came to see me,

701
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,199
and you were hoping that I'd say
that it wasn't true.

702
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,269
Ye Eun.

703
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:00,239
He... Hello?

704
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,510
Ye Eun?

705
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,880
- Ye...
- Mom, it's me!

706
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,349
Yes, it's Mom.

707
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,960
Were you still awake?

708
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,130
It's morning here.

709
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,130
Oh,

710
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
that's right.

711
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,469
Gosh, I always forget.

712
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,000
By the way,

713
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,369
how did you call me?

714
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,340
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

715
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,880
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

716
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,019
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mommy</i>

717
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:43,989
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

718
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:49,860
Thank you.

719
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,960
I'm so happy that my daughter
is wishing me a happy birthday.

720
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:58,099
Your birthday was yesterday,

721
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:01,340
but I forgot to call you. I'm sorry.

722
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:02,469
Goodness.

723
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:04,639
That's okay.

724
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,710
I miss you so much today.

725
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,550
Me too.

726
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,289
Mom, I have to go to school now.

727
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:19,389
Oh, okay. Bye.

728
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:20,889
Ye Eun.

729
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,420
Ye Eun, I love you.

730
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,230
I love you too.

731
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
That guy didn't even have a murder charge.

732
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:15,539
The fact that he suddenly got bold enough
to point a gun at her chest and shoot...

733
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,010
It means he had a glimpse into his future.

734
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,050
In Korea, a nation surrounded by
the sea on three sides,

735
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,780
if you shoot and kill someone with a gun,

736
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,550
it means he intends to
stop dealing drugs here.

737
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,820
Then, what about the fact
that he shot CEO Yoon?

738
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,989
He must've known CEO Yoon would chase
him down until the end if he didn't.

739
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:31,659
Also,

740
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,559
if the Doctor leaves Gong Jin Wook out...

741
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,429
and deals directly with CEO Yoon,

742
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,469
it would leave Gong Jin Wook
with no cards to play.

743
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,139
He was probably thinking he wouldn't leave
the Doctor any other choices.

744
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:46,739
I've already put him on
the wanted and no-fly lists.

745
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,880
He won't have any other choice
but to stow away.

746
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:55,849
Check to see if Gong Jin Wook has
any ties in China or Southeast Asia.

747
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:57,989
- Yes, ma'am.
- Look into stowaway routes too.

748
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

749
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,489
Chang Soo.

750
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,329
You still haven't answered my question.

751
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,159
Sir?

752
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,869
How did you get here?

753
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,769
You went to Lee Geun Ho's place.

754
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:14,139
Oh, that?

755
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,440
Well, I was searching Lee Geun Ho's house,

756
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,380
and I found Gong Jin Wook's address.

757
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:22,539
So, I went to that location,

758
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,309
and Gong Jin Wook was just leaving
right then.

759
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,219
So I tailed him.

760
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,320
You went to Gong Jin Wook's address
by yourself?

761
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:32,389
Not even requesting backup...

762
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:33,590
or making any reports?

763
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
Yes, sir.

764
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,289
I was going to stake out
at the scene and contact you.

765
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,329
I was the one who was surprised...

766
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:41,659
to see you here.

767
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Got it.

768
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,940
So, Captain...

769
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:57,110
Have you perhaps been taking Etaphen?

770
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,750
Yes.

771
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
Are you all right?

772
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:03,519
So far.

773
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,820
That's a relief.

774
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,719
We should catch them soon.

775
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:09,289
I'll gather the evidence,

776
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,329
and return to the station first
with CEO Yoon's man outside.

777
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:19,500
Get back safely.

778
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,570
I'll see you there.

779
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:23,739
Yes, sir.

780
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,820
(Anhyun Shopping Mall)

781
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,329
Get in.

782
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:52,170
The scene is busy. Go and help.

783
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,300
I'll take him in by myself.

784
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,300
Yes, sir.

785
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:56,739
Key.

786
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,219
Why did CEO Yoon call Gong Jin Wook?

787
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:18,989
I'm sorry, but could you speak
a little louder?

788
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,559
I have bad hearing.

789
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,800
Why did CEO Yoon call Gong Jin Wook?

790
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:26,099
Because she wanted to make direct deals
with the Doctor for Lemon Mulberry...

791
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:28,769
She wanted his burner phone.

792
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,780
Was it a trade for Lee Geun Ho?

793
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:38,679
Yes.

794
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Where are we going now?

795
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,230
Listen carefully.

796
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
What?

797
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,539
If you keep the fact
that you saw me last time...

798
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,840
a secret until you die,

799
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,550
I'll let you get out after a short stint.

800
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,010
Got it?

801
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:15,849
By "a short stint,"

802
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:17,550
how much are you talking?

803
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,619
I don't know that, you punk.

804
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:23,230
If anyone asks, just keep your mouth shut.
Got it?

805
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:31,829
Detective.

806
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,570
I...

807
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:36,340
did what I did because CEO Yoon made me,

808
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,269
but I've killed quite a few people.

809
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,110
Are you sure you can reduce my sentence?

810
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,550
That's probably unlikely.

811
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,780
Why don't you just let me off...

812
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,019
on the shoulder over there?

813
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,690
Are you out of your mind?

814
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,789
Numerous people saw me take you away.

815
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,119
I can't free you.

816
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,260
Darn it! What do you want me to do?

817
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,690
I know you and CEO Yoon are close.

818
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,400
I saw you accepting money from her.

819
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,329
It's not like keeping this a secret
would allow me to get out faster.

820
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,969
Right.
That other detective at the scene...

821
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:09,909
I remembered him.

822
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,139
He's the one I drugged
with Lemon Mulberry.

823
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:14,780
He's a druggie, isn't he?

824
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,050
What?

825
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:24,719
What's wrong with detectives these days?

826
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,059
One's a druggie,

827
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,590
- and...
- Shut your mouth!

828
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,730
I can assure you
I'll live quietly in hiding.

829
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,559
Just let me off at the intersection.

830
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,329
If you don't, I have nothing to lose.

831
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,460

832
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:10,969

841
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,329
What is this text about?

842
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,099
It's just as it says.

843
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,269
Do you even know
what password you're talking about?

844
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,739
No, I don't.

845
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,440
You're trying to feel me out.

846
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:35,409
I guess
you could keep asking Ji Yeon instead.

847
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,550
Let me ask you one thing.

848
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,489
The money.

849
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,289
Where did it come from?

850
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,489
Why do you want to know?

851
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,030
Of course, I want to know...

852
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:57,369
since I'll be taking half of it.

853
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:01,099
I don't want to get in trouble later.

854
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,110
Answer me.

855
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:06,809
Where did it come from?

856
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,710
Is it dirty money?

857
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:11,909
If that's the case...

858
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,320
If that's the case,
are you going to keep the password...

859
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:21,389
a secret from me
as an act of social justice?

860
00:55:23,889 --> 00:55:25,989
I know you don't care
where the money is from.

861
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,300
I've seen many likes of you
while working as a prosecutor.

in the beginning."

"I never meant to do that."

864
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:39,269
At the same time,
you still do whatever you want.

865
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,349

00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:46,179
You chose this place.

867
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:49,480
You booked the whole place
to transfer money online,

868
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,420
but you demanded me to tell you
where the money came from.

869

Yoon Jin. I'll say this as a friend.

870
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,230

Don't you agree?

872
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,699
So, enough of the nonsense,

873
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:10,739
and tell me the password.

I had him sitting in the back
in handcuffs,

902
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:37,750
then Ko Gi Sung started to kick me.

903
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,550
Maybe he felt uneasy,
but he went out of control.

but it was useless.

906
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,889
I was trying to keep
the steering wheel steady,

907
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,730
but this was where I ended up.

908
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,960
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

909
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,230
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.

910
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,800
I'm glad you're not any worse.

911
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,900
It was a close call.

912
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,599
We have to transfer him now.

913
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,599
- Okay.
- Sure.

914
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,940
Chang Soo, take care.

915
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,309
I'll visit you at the hospital later.

916
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:07,110
- Soo Hyun, take care of him.
- Okay.

917
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,780
Gosh.

918
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:16,679
That was unexpected.

919
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,750
Someone died from a gunshot,

920
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:21,119
and while transferring a related suspect,

921
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,219
he also died.

922
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,389
I'm scared of what tomorrow will bring.

923
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,130
The police commissioner will be
on the chief of police's case.

924
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:30,000
And the chief of police will want
to kill me.

925
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:45,679
What is it?

926
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,920
- Nothing.
- Just say it.

927
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,389
You think something is suspicious.

928
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,050
What is it?

929
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:57,030
Ko Gi Sung attacked him
from behind the passenger's seat.

930
01:00:57,429 --> 01:00:58,429
From this street,

931
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,900
the car swerved right...

932
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,599
and went off-road in a straight line.

933
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
What?

934
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,699
Didn't Chang Soo say this?

935
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,139
He said Ko Gi Sung kicked him,

936
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,510
so he blocked with his arm.

937
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:13,639
Doing that would make his body turn left.

938
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:15,639
Which means,
the steering wheel would also turn left.

939
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,880
But, the steering wheel turned right.

940
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,280
Well...

941
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:24,690
If the steering wheel had turned left,

942
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,489
he would've crossed the centerline
to run into that.

943
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,719
Maybe he subconsciously turned...

944
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,260
the steering wheel to the right.

945
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,030
While doing that,

946
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:39,300
he turned it too much
without realizing it.

947
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,599
I think it could happen.

948
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,900
I guess so.

949
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,269
Let's go.

950
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,360
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

951
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:08,159
How did the driver Kim Chang Soo escape?

952
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,469
When we got here,
he was already on the shore.

953
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,599
Did anyone touch the window
by the driver's seat?

954
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,469
No, we just got it out of the water.

955
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,070
But it's automatic.

956
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:22,010
It wouldn't have opened underwater...

957
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,739
since the engine would shut down.

958
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
I see.

959
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,650
Wait...

960
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,920
Does that mean he went in the water
with the window open?

961
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:32,590
In this weather?

962
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:36,559
Did Chang Soo...

963
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,199
(Connection)

964
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:25,139
(Connection)

965
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,480
Now that Jun Seo is dead,

966
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,840
who's running the Lemon Mulberry business?

967
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,849
- Good job.
- Thanks.

968
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:32,949
Sang Eui.

969
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:35,619
I told you not to discuss such matters
on the phone. Didn't I?

970
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:36,619
Are you the Doctor?

971
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:39,219
- Sang Eui, did you meet with Jae Gyeong?
- Yes.

972
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,219
I knew it.

973
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,760
This won't do.

974
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,059
Do you really want to kill him?

975
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,360
Do you have a better idea?

976
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,000
Park Tae Jin is behind it all, you fools!

977
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,300
I won't die without a bang.

978
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,469
I'll drag you all down with me.

979
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:53,500
Did you kill Jun Seo with Tae Jin?

980
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,599
What do you mean?

981
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,239
You must be confused.

982
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,539
You believe
one of us definitely killed Jun Seo,

983
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,179
but you don't have the evidence.
Right?

984
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:04,380
You put a lot of work into it.

985
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,449
Too bad.

986
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:08,250
My hunch tells me I'm almost there.

987
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,250
I just have to reach out...

988
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:10,889
and you'll be done.
