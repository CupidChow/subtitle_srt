Director Song. What brings you here?

Please don't be so formal with me. Just call me Qingchun.

27
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,219
Previously, I didn't do a great job.

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,769
I was just too young and naive,

29
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,890
I hope you wouldn't hold it against me.

30

You sound like we are strangers to each other.

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,450
We both want what's best for Huateng Land.

Come, have a seat.

It's normal for young people to make mistakes.

It's still not too late to make up for it.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,300
Su Zhinian just postponed the payment for our supplier.

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,180
It's stalling the construction progress.

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,960
I want him to be removed from the board.

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,229
To make that happen, I need your help and support.

39
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,680
You will surely have my support.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,339
But if you want him to hand over

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,880
his shares willingly, that can be a challenge.

42
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,960
We need to have proof

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,680
as the leverage for negotiation.

44
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,339
Have you found any proof

45
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,029
of him conducting corporate espionage for Liuxing Construction?

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Nothing so far.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,039
But he must have left tracks. I'll keep looking.

48
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,989
I will not stop looking until I find the proof.

49
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,149
It's best to get it done sooner than later.

50
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,680
If we keep waiting, it'll be too late.

What do you have in mind?

52

Stay out of this matter.

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,060
It's on the way.

494
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,670
My waist...

495
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:30,319
- What's wrong?
- I'm watching the stream.

496
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,000
They are unboxing my favorite rare collector's item.

497
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,290
Su Zhinian.

498
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,469
Sorry, I forgot to turn off the flash for a selfie.

499
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,349
What if a woman secretly takes a picture of you?

500
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:35,820
What does it mean?

501
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,130
She is interested in you, of course.

502
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,109
Who took your picture? Song Qingchun?

503
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,490
Why are you still with her at this hour?

504
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,810
How is the progress?

505
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,719
Nothing, really. She asked me to join her for crayfish.

506
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,029
Maybe we should have crayfish another time.

507
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,519
It's getting late, go get some rest.

508
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,000
The night is still young.

509
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,639
I'm feeling sleepy.

510
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,440
I feel so sleepy.

511
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,779
Song Qing Cong: Did this talisman work? Please share it with me

512
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:26,360
It will come in handy on business trips.

513
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,330
A talisman?

514
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,919
You heard what the couple said in the lobby.

515
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:37,919
Rooms at the end of hallways are usually haunted.

516
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:41,410
But it's fine after you come. So, I use your photo instead.

517
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,909
I'm powerful enough to ward off evil spirits?

518
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,929
You can do it. You can be worse than evil spirits at times.

519
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:52,429
Song Qingchun. Delete the picture now.

520
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:54,519
I'll delete this tomorrow. All right.

521
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,919
Go back to your room and rest well. Good night.

522
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:59,030
Go on.

523
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,240
Off you go.

524
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,840
Bye.

525
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,480
With this...

526
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,490
Su Zhinian!

527
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,789
Su Zhinian. Su Zhinian.

528
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:29,009
Su Zhinian, I checked, the crayfish will be here soon.

529
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:32,159
- Join me.
- I thought you said you were sleepy.

530
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,710
Not anymore.

531
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,649
- It's late.
- But you said the night was still young.

532
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:41,510
I feel sleepy.

533
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,929
Stay awake! Help me finish it,

534
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,889
it will be a waste if I can't finish it.

535
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,630
The crayfish is delicious.

536
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,409
Right? Let's eat it together.

537
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,529
Are you afraid of the dark?

538
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:57,310
I'm not.

539
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,179
Hello, the crayfish is here.

540
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,440
Sorry, the fuse was broken.

541
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,310
We'll fix it right away.

542
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,609
Sorry. Get the crayfish.

543
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:31,609
Hello, sir. Your crayfish.

544
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,009
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

545
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,950
Slowly.

546
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,729
Hello? Why are you calling?

547
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:07,259
Where are you? Are you with Song Qingchun right now?

548
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:10,920
Your heart rates are spiking like Mount Everest.

549
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,190
I'm hanging up.

550
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,440
Hello?

551
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,409
I've read about the haunting online.

552
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:29,160
In most cases, someone died in the room.

553
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,309
But don't worry, it's not the case here.

554
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,330
It's some problem with the wiring.

555
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,520
Don't believe the couple's story.

556
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,009
The food is here. Enjoy your food.

557
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,030
I'll leave you be.

558
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,810
Stay!

559
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,809
I ordered too much, I can't finish it all by myself.

560
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,950
Sit down and join me.

561
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,539
This seller is all over the internet.

562
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,829
People give great ratings. It's delicious.

563
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:10,440
Go on.

564
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,329
Did it spill on my face? Ge me some tissue paper.

565
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,460
See?

566
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,539
Dig in. Help yourself.

567
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:29,040
Go on.

568
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,660
