Most of our jobs were completed before the end of the month.

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,500
Watch your step.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Has Director Su been treating you like that?

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
It's nothing, actually.

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,200
I haven't seen him for a few years. I feel that he changed a lot.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
However, I can understand this.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,700
Even if he's willing to help Huateng Land for old times sake,

28
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,300
he still needs to consider his own interests.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,100
If you were to have any conflicts, don't argue with him.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,200
I'll figure out what to do.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Let's go.

- Are you all right?
- How are you?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm okay. Look at Brother Yinan.

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,400
I can't move my leg.

39

Okay, please don't worry.

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
The news about Director Qin getting injured has been controlled.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Yes, Director Su is in the hospital now.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Is Su Zhinian in the hospital?

47

Who is injured?

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,900
If Dr. Yan knows Director Su is taking care of Director Qin in the hospital,

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,400
he'll be hurt.

I'm asking you.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,100
You heard me wrong.

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,000
I was saying about Director Shu, an employee in Huateng Land.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Director Su is still having a meeting at Geiger Capital.

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Really? I came here from Geiger Capital.

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,900
Why are you feeling guilty?

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,300
You're lying.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,100
Want to run away again? I haven't scolded you for the previous incident.

58
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,200
Dr. Yan, I really have something urgent.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,600
What is it?

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Director Su works overtime every day.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,700
As his assistant, I mustn't idle about.

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,500
No wonder you have dark circles under your eyes. It's really hard for you.

63

Shall I help you talk to him?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
No. This is my job responsibility.

65

- I'm doing this for you.
- Dr. Yan.

I want to see what you're up to.

72
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,200
You don't know how dangerous it was at that time.

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
He didn't hesitate at all and leaped to protect me.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,900
As you said, it was dangerous. You've known each other for so many years. Why wouldn't he save you?

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
You tell me then.

76
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
What is he thinking?

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,400
Sometimes, I feel that he likes me.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
He has always been caring for me since young.

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
He complies with me all the time,

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,000
but sometimes I feel that he's just taking me as a little sister.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Maybe I'm thinking too much.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't overthink. If he likes you, he will definitely tell you.

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not my style to wait for people to tell me.

Four years ago, if I hadn't...

I would've confessed already.

Tomorrow is Brother Yinan's birthday.

Shall I ask him and make things clear? At the worst, I'll be rejected.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,200
I can also start looking for the next one.

Except for Britain, America and their colonies,

are all other regions following the Civil Law System?

95
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,900
Almost.

96
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,200
This is because an effective Case Law requires long-term accumulation and organization of cases.

97

The latecomers do not meet this requirement.

of Twelve Beauties of Jinling?

100
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,300
It's because she was very loyal to Bao Yu without any selfish aims.

101
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,000
She was also the only maid who was self-conscious.

Is this process an entropy increase or decrease?

104

It's an entropy increase.

105

When it comes to microstates and entropy, the status number in the phase space

Crunches are not like this.

Most importantly, you have to tighten the abdominal muscles and make use of the core's strength.

Hurry up.

155
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
What happened? Did she fall or involve in an accident?

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,100
She hit the back of her head when she was doing crunches.

157
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Do you need to make a fuss when she only hit the back of her head?

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
Of course.

159
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,300
The head is the most important part of the body.

160
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
I said you don't have to make a fuss.

161

All right. I'll arrange a CT scan for her.

No wonder you are so anxious.

165
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
When did the two of you get together again?

166
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
Is it serious?

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Of course!

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
It's because of her, you didn't answer my call.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
You didn't allow me to go to your house on weekends.

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,300
You didn't play ball with me on Monday. You stood me up on Wednesday.

171
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,000
Even our happy hour on Friday was canceled. You weren't like this, Su Zhinian.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,100
Who knows whether you would break up with me?

173
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,400
- Do we meet so frequently?
- Don't change the topic.

When did you start living together?

176
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,400
- Two weeks ago.
- Tell her to move out immediately.

177
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,300
She's just like a time bomb when she's with you. You won't have peace.

178

It's the exact opposite.

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Only when I'm beside her, I can gain peace.

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Peace?

181
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,200
Fine.

Uncle Song's condition is quite good.

I've confirmed the treatment plan for him

185
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,200
but I still need Miss Song's cooperation in certain areas.

Sure, now?

Don't you have other work now?

Well, you can stay here for a while.

Don't worry. I won't let him go to my house.

Director Su, you don't have to explain.

Just suppress me like how you used the contract.

261
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,300
I won't say anything.

262

- Xiao Nan Shan.
- What a coincidence.

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,100
I wanted to bring a new friend there for a date

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
to enhance our relationship.

274

I'll confirm the dishes with you later.

276

Oh, serve the dessert for the lady after the meal.

277

289
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,500
I get it now. It's a blind date.

290
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,600
Dr. Yan's family must be pushing him to get married.

291
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
There are so many pretty girls. Why can't you get one girlfriend?

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,300
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you up to?

293
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,100
You're just playing every day. You don't even have a girlfriend at this age.

294
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,800
- Do you want us to die of anger?
- Look!

295
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
Is this okay? What about this one?

296
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
And this. Not good?

297
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,800
Don't come home if you can't get a girlfriend.

298
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,500
I didn't expect that a neurologist could understand one's heart so well.

299
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,200
To be honest, were you analyzing me just now?

300
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,300
I thought we were the same type of people, so our minds were in sync.

301
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,600
Dr. Yan looks like he's suffering.

302
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,400
How pitiful.

303
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,500
I must rescue him.

00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,539
- What's wrong with you?
- Who is she?

307
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:17,519
Didn't you say that you'd pick me up and go home earlier?

308
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,389
Go home? What?

309
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:21,810
Who is she?

310
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,609
She's my patient who has been transferred from the psychiatry department.

311
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,980
She has been receiving treatment but she's not stable yet.

312
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,479
We agreed to do the role-play at home.

313
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,210
- Didn't you say that?
- I won't disturb you, I'm leaving now.

314
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,479
Darling! Listen to me, she's not my cup of tea.

315
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:41,639
Yesterday, you even said that our daughter will be as cute as me.

Enough!

317
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,609
- Get off, jerk!
- Darling! Dar...

318
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,510
How can you say that you have my baby?

319
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,389
Dr. Yan, I did this for you.

320
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,999
Humans become great because of love.

321
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,489
You must be able to express your love as well as reject it.

322
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,960
Since when did you have such thoughts?

When a woman is happy with you, she really is happy.

00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,429
and she wants to eat a hot pot, how would you reply?

485
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:31,420
A hotpot is heaty.

486
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,679
We can go out together to buy some ingredients and cook at home.

487
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,580
What if you bought food home and she was worried of gaining weight?

488
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,520
She could eat other food.

489
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,300
This reply is telling her that you think that she's fat.

490
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,010
You have to compliment her body shape.

491
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,239
You're a hypocrite.

492
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,280
Hypocrite?

493
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,340
That Lawyer Qin whom she admires so much

494
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,860
would definitely assure her gently

495
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,870
if he encountered this situation.

496
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,820
"Stop it."

497
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,579
"If you're fat, what should other ladies think of themselves?"

498
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:03,860
That's why he's a hypocrite.

499
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,880
This isn't important. The key is Song Qingchun likes it.

500
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,860
At this moment, give her a pat on the head,

501
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,170
normal girls won't be able to withstand this.

502
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,909
All right, one last question.

503
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,919
If she were to ask you to tell her something romantic,

504
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,780
what would you say?

505
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,430
Come on. Look at me.

506
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:31,049
Show your affection. Come.

507
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,960
Ever since I met you,

508
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,770
my demand curve has gone haywire.

509
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,780
To me, you're a luxury and also a necessity.

510
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,420
You can do this well, can't you?

511
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,139
Tell you what. Love is a game of pushing and pulling.

512
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:53,090
The key is to play hard to get.

513
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,090
If she backs off, you move forward and vice versa.

514
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,650
Stay cool appropriately.

515
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,910
You mustn't let her decide everything.

516
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,720
Follow what I say.

517
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,240
Hello?

518
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,520
Take care of her. I'm coming now.

519
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,130

I'm so ugly! So ugly!

All right. Let's go home now.

530

Why are you so fierce?

531
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,570
I'm not scolding you.

532
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,489
I'm just worried about you. I'm here to take you home.

I'm not going home.

534
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,009
You'll punish me and force me to memorize texts

535
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,700
once I get home.

536
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,799
I promise that I'll do whatever you want with you.

537
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,480
Okay?

538
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,549
I want to eat a hotpot.

539
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,550
Okay, we'll go home and eat.

540
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,519
No!

541
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:35,090
I'll gain weight.

542
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:39,450
No one will like me if I become fatter.

543
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,610
You're not fat at all.

544
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,429
Leave some chance for other girls.

545
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,290
Okay?

546
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,370
Don't touch me.

547
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,710
You have a girlfriend already. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

548
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,250
I was imagining for such a long time.

Don't scold me.

Please don't scold me.

Stop crying.

554
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,839
Do you need to do this because of such trivial matters? Don't you feel embarrassed?

555
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,709
Why are you so cold-blooded?

556
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,479
I'm so sad now yet you're making sarcastic comments there.

557

Can you shut up?

558
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,530
No, I'm inhumane.

Come here and eat.

583
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,790
- Aren't you eating?
- I've eaten.

584
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,320
You can take time off today.

585

This is not right, Su Zhinian.

586
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,490
You're acting weird today.

No.

All right. Tell me.
