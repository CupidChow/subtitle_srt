Director Lin. We're so sorry for missing the appointment.

00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,750
Besides asking you to give Huateng Land another chance,

26
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,360
we came to apologize to you in person as well.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,199
If you're here for Qinghu, I suggest you don't waste your time.

28
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,899
I know that Wancheng hasn't decided on the final business partner.

29
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:28,659
Could you give us another chance since Qinghu holds a special meaning to you?

30
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,180
At least, do take a look at our latest proposal.

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,640
Tell me then. How is it that Qinghu is of great significance to me?

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,219
As far as I know, Qinghu was where you worked during the Down to the Countryside Movement in the late '70s.

33
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,259
You stayed there for five years.

34
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:46,139
Later on, you established Wancheng and devoted yourself to the real estate industry.

35
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,220
Then, you began to prepare for the Impression Qinghu project.

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,339
So far, it should have been nearly ten years now.

37
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,440
This is the project that you invested the longest time in since you established Wancheng.

Young lady.

39
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,620
Don't act as if you know me well after reading a few online news articles about me.

40
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,039
On the contrary, I'm disgusted with this place, Qinghu.

41
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,759
To me, it doesn't matter who wins the tender or what the inside story is.

42
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,919
As long as Wancheng doesn't lose money, it's the same no matter who gets the tender.

43
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,740
But after all, Qinghu is where your career started.

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,700
I don't believe you'll choose to work with a partner of bad character.

45

For the things that I've lost because of it...

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,179
I won't change my mind.

47
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,840
You may go now.

48
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,539
Director Lin. Please stay.

49
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,000
I remember you once said that in business, there are no deals that can't be negotiated.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,940
What's missing is having the right bargaining chips.

Qinghu project may be of little value to you.

53

But for Huateng Land, it is the only way out.

54

No matter what the conditions are, we will try our best to meet them.

00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,060
How embarrassing it is if you're not here?

162
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,689
What if something unexpected happens? I won't be able to handle it.

163
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,969
Look at you.

164
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,089
Go. Sit at the back. I'll take care of it.

165
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,590
Okay.

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Hi.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm Wu Gangqiang.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm going to the gents.

169
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay, I'll wait for you.

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
Dr. Yan! Dr. Yan, wait up!

171
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,700
Dr. Yan! What's wrong? None is acceptable?

172
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,500
That's right. Totally unacceptable!

173
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,400
Stop wasting your time, okay?

174
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
I know what you're up to.

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
But there's no need for that and it's impossible.

176
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
- But...
- But?

177
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
But what?

178
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,100
Hello?

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,900
Why would a pregnant lady... Cerebral hypoxia and hemorrhage?

180
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Which surgeon is in charge?

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How are the vital signs?

182
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,500
All right. I'll be there in ten.

183
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Go home on your own.

184
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,800
Dr. Yan, drive safe!

185
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,600
Hi. Is this your friend's wallet?

186
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
Let me take a look.

187
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,000
[Yan Yuan]

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,300
That's right. Thank you.

189
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,800
You're welcome. It's what we do.

190
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,300
Wait for me for three years.

191
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll cheer on for you alone for the rest of my life.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,300
Winter of 1978. Lin Hansheng.

193
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,300
When you return, I shall dance for you alone.

194
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,700
Waiting for you.

195
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,100
Winter of 1978. Mei Hanxiang.

196
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,300
I bet Director Lin couldn't forget Ms. Mei.

197
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,600
If not, he wouldn't still

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
be keeping this photo and those tickets after so many years.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He stayed in Qinghu for five years and didn't leave until 1983.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And Ms. Mei left Haicheng in 1981.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
After several twists and turns,

202
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Ms. Mei went abroad and joined the American Ballet Theater and never came back.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why do you think they couldn't be together?

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,900
Perhaps, back in those days, they had to yield to circumstances.

205
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,400
Director Lin.

206
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,500
Where's the photo?

207
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,700
I'm sorry. I accidentally put it inside the file holder.

208
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
Thank you.

209
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,400
Hanxiang.

210
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,700
Lin Hansheng.

211
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
You've aged.

212
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,700
That's right.

213
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,600
We're not young anymore.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
But I don't think I'm old.

215
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,000
I said the wrong thing.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,900
You're still so young and beautiful.

217
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,800
Look at you.

218
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
You don't even know how to tell a lie.

219
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Why have you lied to me for so many years?

220
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,400
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,800
I waited all these years

223
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,800
not to hear you say this.

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I...

225
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Han...

226
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,300
Stay with Director Lin. I'll go and find Ms. Mei.

227
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,100
Actually, it was Ms. Mei who wanted to see you.

228
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,400
I think she deliberately set the last stop of the tour

229
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,700
in Haicheng just to wait for you.

230
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,100
That night, it was my first time going on the stage.

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,300
I was so excited.

232
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,000
After the performance, I was reluctant to leave.

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,100
I didn't even get changed and went up on stage again.

234
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,300
The stage was completely dark.

235
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
But I wasn't afraid at all.

236
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I kept spinning and dancing

237
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
until a beam of light suddenly shone on me.

238
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
That year,

239
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
I was just a poor kid.

240
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,000
So poor that I had only a few books with me.

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,700
To make some pocket money, I went to work at the theater.

242
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
At first, I just couldn't get it.

243
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,900
With all the dancing and jumping on the stage, what's there really to see?

244
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,000
Until that night, many people came to the show.

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,400
When the curtain came down, there was loud, thunderous applause.

246
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,800
After the show, I was carrying a torchlight and I suddenly came across her.

247
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,300
It gave her quite a shock and she fell down.

248
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,000
Later on, my foot injury was healed.

249
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,200
But I couldn't fit into my pointe shoes.

250
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
So he searched all around Haicheng

251
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,800
and spent all his money

252
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
to customize a pair of pointe shoes for me.

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,700
He brought it to me

254
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
and said...

255
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,600
From now on, all your pointe shoes
will be my responsibility.

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Then, she...

257
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,400
pretended to be mad and stared at me.

258
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,300
"If I were to dance for a lifetime,"

259
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,500
"how long do you think you could take responsibility for me?"

260
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,900
He said,

261
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,400
"For a lifetime."

262
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,500
But not long after,

263
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,600
he was sent to the rural area in Qinghu.

264
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,400
In less than a year,

265
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,200
he wrote me a letter

266
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,700
and told me he had fallen in love with a local girl

267
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,100
and that he would marry her at the end of the year.

268
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,900
But as far as I know, Director Lin doesn't have a wife.

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,800
I only know that later on.

270
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,400
If this were to happen in this era,

271
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
his lie would have been exposed.

272
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,200
But back in those days...

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,800
Why did you lie to her back then?

274
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
[Arrogant Man]

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Something happened to me in Qinghu.

276
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,600
I thought I would never be able to go back anymore.

277
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,300
So you didn't want to waste her time?

278
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
How should I put it?

279
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,900
Back then,

280
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,400
I would do whatever it takes just to come back.

281
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,900
As long as there was a chance to perform, I would fight for it.

282
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,300
No matter how dangerous the task may be,

283
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,400
I would do it.

284
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
That year, during the winter solstice,

285
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,500
I accidentally fell in Qinghu when I was working in the open air.

286
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,700
I even broke my leg.

287
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
It left me with a high fever and pneumonia.

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,200
I was bedridden for over half a year.

289
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
What's more ironic

290
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,379
is that when I was at my lowest,

291
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,200
it was Hanxiang's starting point.

292
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,400
My classmates told me

293
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,300
that a well-known dance troupe reached out to her.

294
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,100
So without hesitation, you lied to her

295
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,200
that you fell for someone else.

296
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,000
I thought this was the only thing I could do for her.

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But she isn't married either.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
Why didn't you go and see her?

299
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
You clearly can't get over her.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,200
Why is it disconnected at such a critical moment?

301
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
It's okay.

302
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Let bygones be bygones.

303
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,900
Thank you for tonight.

304
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,200
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

305
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,500
Doctor, how's my wife?

306
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
Don't worry. The baby is safely delivered.

307
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,000
What about my wife?

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,700
But as for the mother...

309
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,800
- How is she?
- We've tried our best.

310
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,500
What? Tried your best?

311
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,700
Tried your best?

312
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,800
- My daughter!
- Mom.

313
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
- My daughter!
- Mom!

314
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
My daughter!

315
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Mom! Mom!

316
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Mom. Come on.

317
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,500
Here.

318
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Thank you.

319
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,500
Are you okay?

320
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,200
Why are you here?

321
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
You left your wallet in the restaurant.

322
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,200
You didn't have to pass it to me today.

323
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,989
It's so late now, and you had to come all the way here.

324
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,300
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,000
It's okay.

326
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,000
I saw what happened earlier.

327
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,100
Don't beat yourself up.

328
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,900
When I got to the operating theater,

329
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,500
she had already given birth.

330
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,300
The baby was fine.

331
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,900
But she...

332
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,900
I knew I couldn't save her.

333
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,700
The only thing I could do was to do my best

334
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
to help her live through the day.

335
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,600
I don't want that child to spend every birthday

336
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,800
with the memory

337
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,700
of his mother's death in the future.

338
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,000
Dr. Yan. Don't be upset.

339
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
I know you've tried your best.

340
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,800
You're just a doctor, not a god.

341
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
You don't have to shoulder all the responsibility.

342
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,400
You've done a good job.

343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,900
Is that really what you think?

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,600
You are the gentlest person I have ever met.

345
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,900
I guess there are many wonderful memories between you and your mom.

346
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,300
It's late. I'm on duty today.

347
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,700
Come on. I'll walk you out.

348
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,100
She knew it was a misunderstanding.

349
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,800
Why does Ms. Mei still refuse to see Director Lin?

350
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
Director Lin is to blame too.

351
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
He knew she was single. But he wouldn't take the initiative.

352
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,800
Does he still feel inferior and worried that he would be a drag on her?

353
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,200
Something like that.

354
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,800
Director Lin suffered an illness after he fell into the water.

355
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,500
Later on, he found out he had a tumor.

356
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
He's been going in and out of surgery all these years.

357
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,200
So what if I can't get over her?

358
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,400
I don't have much time left.

359
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Why be a drag on her?

360
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,000
[Non-Performing Asset]

361
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Is something wrong with your health?

362
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,500
I have a favor to ask of you. Don't ever tell her this.

363
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,400
It's a tumor.

364
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,900
Okay, I give you my word.

365
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,400
If I were you,

366
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,000
I would make the same choice as well.

367
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,800
He thinks that Ms. Mei belongs to the stage,

368
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,700
instead of staying by his side, who's a sick old man.

369
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,400
It's not what he thinks! It's what she thinks!

370
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,900
Since they're in love, they should cherish every moment that they get to spend together.

371
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,000
Why all the hesitations?

372
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,200
It's not enough for two people to love each other.

373
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
They have to be responsible for one another.

374
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,600
Do men enjoy these false notions of self-sacrifice?

375
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Director Lin kept saying that it was for Ms. Mei's sake.

376
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,000
If you ask me, the sufferings that she endured for the next few decades were all because of him.

377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
And now, he's doing this.

378
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
To be blunt, it's just pure selfishness.

379
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,300
In the future, if anyone dares to pull this "It's for your own good" on me,

380
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,500
I'll tell him to get out of the way!

381
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,600
Well, what do you prefer him to do?

382
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Obviously, I hope

383
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,000
we can rely on each other and have mutual trust.

384
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
No matter what happens, we'll face it together.

385
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,600
Why am I telling you this?

386
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
What do you care?

387
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
That's mine!

388
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm surprised you have such a high standard.

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,600
Add another criterion on top of that. Able to ward off evil.

390
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,700
You're so annoying.

391
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,300
I'm being serious. Why did you interrupt me?

392
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,100
Whatever it is, I'm telling Ms. Mei about it.

393
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,000
It's up to her to decide.

394
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,600
No way. I gave Director Lin my word.

395
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,300
That's right. You did, not me.

396
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,800
I'm going to the washroom. Wait here for me.

397
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,200
That's not right. What is she up to again?

398
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,700
Ms. Mei!

399
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,700
Ms. Mei!

I was about to find you. Here are the tickets for tomorrow's show.

401

[Admission Ticket]
You two can come tomorrow.

402
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
Thank you, Ms. Mei.

403
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,300
Ms. Mei. I came to tell you something.

404
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Sorry.

405
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Okay, thank you.

406
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
Director Lin.

407
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
Director Lin...

408
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,200
From now on, you don't have to tell me about him.

409
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,300
Go back and rest. Don't catch a cold.

410
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,400
Wait, Ms. Mei. I want to tell you that...

411
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,979
- Qingchun is allergic to pollen.
- I'm not!

412
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:41,600
It's getting late. Rest earlier.

413
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,100
Ms. Mei!

414
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,600
Su Zhinian, I'm not done talking!

415
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,800
Why did you drag me here?

416
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,500
Su Zhinian!

417
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Su Zhinian. Even if I don't tell Ms. Mei about it, I can make Director Lin come clean with her.

418
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Sure.

419
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,600
Tomorrow is her official performance. You have until tomorrow.

420
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,100
Okay. I'll take my chances.

421
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,400
Sure. Bring it on.

422
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,000
Speak.

423
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,600
Can't find it?

424
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,200
That means she noticed that something wasn't right.

425
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,300
No worries.

426
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,600
Get someone to keep an eye on her and Su Zhinian.

427
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,400
Are you working this weekend?

428
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,600
I was recording a domestic violence program in the past two days.

429
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,000
It's a wrap today.

430
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
I heard that the American Ballet Theater has a tour in Haicheng.

431
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
My friend gave me two tickets.

432
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,200
Haicheng is my hometown. I'm familiar with the place.

433
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Let's take a trip there and have a short vacation.

434
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,450
You still remember that I like to watch ballet performances?

435
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,400
Of course.

436
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,900
I remember there's a ballerina by the last name Mei, right?

437
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,200
That's right.

438
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,400
But the one I like is Alina Somova from Russia.

439
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Right, she's great too.

440
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's watch her performance if there's a chance.

441
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,100
-Sure.
- Let's go.

442
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
- Director Lin.
- Why are you here?

443
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,700
If you're here because of the project, I've notified my staff about it.

444
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,139
Just send your proposal over will do.

445
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,309
No. No. It's Ms. Mei.

446
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,200
Just now, Ms. Mei...

447
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
What happened to her?

448
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,000
Ms. Mei doesn't have a family.

449
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,600
She might not have anyone in this lifetime.

450
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
Are you willing to take care of her?

451
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Wait. Where's she now?

452
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Cut the crap. Tell me where she is. I'll go and find her.

453
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,800
She... She's all right.

454
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,100
I'm sorry, Director Lin. I lied to you.

455
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,100
I just wanted you to get a taste of how Ms. Mei would feel in the future.

456
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,400
You're afraid of not being able to take care of her and that you'll waste her time.

457
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,600
But you never thought about if all she wanted was to find someone who could take care of her,

458
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,200
why stay single until now?

459
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,600
It's true.

460
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,800
Besides love, two people stay together because of their responsibility for one another.

461
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,500
But don't neglect the fact that it's one another.

462
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,800
She, too, wants to be responsible of you.

463
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,200
What Ms. Mei wants is someone who can take care of her

464
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,000
and is willing to be taken care of by her.

465
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,699
Later, get someone to move the things over there.

466
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:52,539
- Okay.
- Don't let it get in the way.

467
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,359
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

468
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,580
Ms. Mei.

469
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,039
Do you know why Director Lin wants to see you perform again?

470
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,829
It's because he has never come to your show, not once in his life.

471
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:12,979
But he bought the tickets for all your performances.

472
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:16,470
But he never stepped inside because of fear

473
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,880
and because he couldn't.

474
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,579
All these years, he could only look at the oil painting in his study

475
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:26,239
of you dancing on the stage when you two first met

476
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,340
to make good on his promise.

477
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,320
That's right.

478
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,730
I haven't made good on my promise to him.

479
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,919
It's over.

480
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,880
I lost.

481
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,160
I guess he's not coming.

00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,999
I owe you a dance, I've made good on my promise.

486
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:21,370
Perhaps,

487
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,900
it's done between the two of us.

488
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,400
Hanxiang.

489
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,450
I know.

490
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:37,109
When I was young, I didn't take care of myself and fell ill.

491
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:39,680
I had surgery last year.

492
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,789
Truth be told, I don't know how much time do I have left.

493
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,320
I would like to ask you

494
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,280
if I could use my remaining time

495
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,710
to take care of you and to keep you company?

496
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,749
Here, Ms. Mei. Three, two, one.

497
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:48,870
Cheese!

498
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,050
So this is love.

499
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,049
Didn't you have your heart broken? Do you only know that now?

500
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,610
Shut up, will you?

501
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,990
Ms. Mei. Look.

502
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,790
It's nice, isn't it?

503
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,559
- It's so nice.
- Not bad.

504
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,749
- I'll take a picture for you two.
- It's okay.

505
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:13,390
- Sure. Thank you.
- Come on.

506
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,700
Come on.

507
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,190
I'll take a picture for you.

508
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,039
All right. One, two, three.

509
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,849
- Sir, how much is it?
- 43 yuan.

510
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,600
It's a waste of this last piece of film.

511
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,919
It's all your fault. I look so awful in this!

512
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,659
- Give it to me if you don't like it.
- Why should I?

513
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:39,280
I paid for the film.

514
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,380
So what?

515
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,969
Well, about our bet last night.

516
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,609
How do we go about that?

517
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,770
What do you think?

518
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,089
Ms. Mei stayed because of you.

519
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,050
Director Lin showed up because of me.

520
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,050
But the good thing is they ended up together.

521
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,520
We're even then.

522
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,359
Even? That's boring.

523
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,679
How about this? We both won.

524
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,089
Promise me one thing, and I'll promise you one. How about that?

525
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:12,089
What do you want?

526
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,280
- Brother Yinan used to tell me—
- No.

527
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,330
You...

528
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,130
No point staring at me.

529
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,219
You poured so much vinegar. Don't you find it sour?

530
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,180
I like it that way.

531
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,090
Can't I?

532
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,939
You sure are a capitalist, Director Su.

533
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:34,000
You won't let yourself suffer losses even when having a bowl of wonton.

534
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,499
So aren't you going to reconsider what I just said?

535
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,570
No.

536
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,329
What a penny-pincher, you won't even lend me 500 yuan.

537
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,800
This was what you were talking about?

538
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,750
Why did you bring Qin Yinan up then?

539
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,569
Well... This is his hometown.

540
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:56,869
He used to tell me that the night market here is worth a visit.

541
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,040
So?

542
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,820

550
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,180

♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

558
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,650
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

559
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,580
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

560
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:09,610
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

561
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:15,799
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

562
00:41:15,799 --> 00:41:19,620
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

563
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:26,900
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

564
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,180
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
