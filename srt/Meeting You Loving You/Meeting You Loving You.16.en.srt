My apologies.

[Mr. Landlord]
I like your gift very much. I've seen the rental agreement.

44
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,100
There are a few problematic clauses that I think are better discussed face-to-face.

45
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,000
Also, the building management is upgrading the access system.

46

Director Song. The contract we submitted to Yangguang Capital had a problem.

50
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Take a look. I only realized after Director Su pointed it out.

51
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,300
The allocation percentage stated in the contract we sent is different from what you said before.

52
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,100
How could there be such a careless mistake?

53
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
What about Yangguang?

54
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
- Have they signed it?
- Not yet.

55

Their newly-appointed manager is currently busy with the handover process.

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I suppose they haven't had the chance to see it.

57
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,400
Make an appointment with him pronto.

58
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
And prepare a new copy of the contract.

59
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
- I will see him personally.
- Got it.

Oh, I'm so jealous of you.

62

Director Su sure is romantic.

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,200
He sends you flowers even though he sees you every day.

64
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,000
These are roses air-shipped from Bulgaria.

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,300
Plus, there are 99 stems. I counted twice.

66
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,600
I told him to be low-key.

67
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
It's not very nice to be extravagant and wasteful.

68

You can throw it away if you don't like it.

My assistant said you wish to see me. I guess we share telepathy.

Of course.

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,200
I wouldn't dare turn down your invitation, Director Chen.

Hi, Director Chen. Nice to meet you. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused.

92
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,300
Director Song, we are both young business people. Let us dispense with formalities, shall we?

93
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,400
This must be Director Su.

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Why aren't you inviting him upstairs?

95
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
There's no need. I came here today specifically to see Director Song.

96
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
You are even more beautiful in person than on television.

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Since I got what I came for, I won't take up more of your time.

98
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
Director Chen. So, regarding the Qinghu contract...

99
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
I've been briefed about Qinghu.

100
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,100
I hope you won't make things difficult for me though.

101
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,200
I really despise pretending to talk business in the office.

102
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
So stuffy.

103
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I won't.

104
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
I heard that there's a new rock climbing place in the south of the city.

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
I wonder if you are interested?

106
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,000
Rock climbing sounds good. I do enjoy rock climbing.

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,300
It's set then.

108
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,600
Tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock. I hope that's okay with you.

109
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
Sorry. I forgot about Director Su.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,900
- Sure.
- No.

111
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,600
Well then, see you tomorrow.

112
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Okay. See you.

113
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,699
Looks like you were pretty hostile towards Director Chen.

114
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,350
What is it?

115
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,999
Are you envious because he's more amusing and more handsome than you?

116
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:15,650
If you can't see clearly, best you get some prescription glasses.

117
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,950
Don't mess up our business.

118
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,599
Dr. Yan. What a coincidence.

119
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,729
I guess so. I have an errand to run.

120
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,649
- I live here.
- I know.

121
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,299
You go ahead then. I'm going to the building management.

122
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,400
We happen to be going the same way.

123
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,809
Dr. Yan. Do you like me?

124
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,530
I think I know the answer.

125
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,430
Let's be together.

126
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,470
But you haven't answered my question.

127
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,250
Is liking really that important?

128
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,609
Many couples profess their feelings freely, but they break up faster than anyone.

129
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:31,159
All that matters is for two people to be happy together.

130
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,940
Did you treat your ex-girlfriend the same way?

131
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,579
Stay together if you're happy, break up if you're not.

132
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,250
But I can't do that.

133
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,390
I'm sorry about that night.

134
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,989
I hope we don't contact each other again. My boyfriend treats me very well.

135
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:55,680
And I like him a lot.

136
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,890
When did I become your boyfriend?

137
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,770
Miss Cheng from Room 302.

138
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,909
Where are you going, my girlfriend?

139
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:07,499
- I won't extend the contract.
- Why not?

140
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:11,039
I have to travel between Huateng and Geiger now. It's inconvenient to commute without taking the metro.

141
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,299
If I remember correctly, it only takes five minutes to walk from here to Geiger.

142
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,969
And it's about 10 minutes by bike to Huateng.

143
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,830
Is there a better location than this place?

144
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,780
The rent is too high.

145
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,209
Didn't you already pay the rent in advance for the next few years?

146
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:25,980
That's compensation for you.

147
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,149
Since I'm already your boyfriend, there's no need for compensation.

148
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,809
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied.

149
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,050
What if I don't mind that the lie becomes the truth?

150
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
You like me, don't you?

151
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,210
I like you.

152
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,930
What about you?

153
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,950
Why must you dwell on the answer?

154
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,950
Because I'm just a normal girl.

155
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,940
I can't be like your ex-girlfriend.

156
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,410
I'm not able to start and end a relationship so easily.

157
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,609
I've never had a relationship, but I hope that my boyfriend and I are together

158
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,980
because we like each other.

159
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,550
Give me some time to think about it.

160
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,149
And you don't have to move out in a hurry. I won't disturb you.

161
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,860
By the way, do you like the gift?

162
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,179
I love it. But I hope we'll be able to watch it together next time.

163
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,870
Tomorrow will be my first time trying rock climbing.

164
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,930
But I heard that Director Chen is a pro.

165
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,980
I reckon he'll guide me.

166
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,190
I won't embarrass myself, right?

167
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,749
Actually, I'm glad you're not going.

168
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:41,790
A physically exhausting extreme sport like that isn't suited for a man your age.

169
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,930
What about my age?

170
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,019
I'd say Director Chen is about your age.

171
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,800
But standing next to him, you really look much older.

172
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,839
Be it the physique, demeanor, or in the way of handling things,

173
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,620
he has much more of a younger vibe than you.

174
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,710
He's jealous.

175
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,510
Hello, Cong Cong.

176
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,940
Okay.

177
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,899
- Do I look—
- What exactly—

178
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,720
You go ahead.

179
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,950
What exactly is "like"?

180
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,219
She said she liked me but she rejected me. All because I couldn't tell her if I liked her or not.

181
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,730
So do you like her?

182
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,219
Listen. He couldn't answer because he had doubts. You can't let such a man have his way.

183
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,009
I can't even tell which parts are true and which parts are fake.

184
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:18,960
That's why I wanted to ask you to help me find out how I actually feel.

185
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,540
- She could be looking for more than an answer.
- What is it then?

186
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,130
A sense of security.

187
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,110
I don't feel secure.

188
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,609
That's a given. Because you two skipped the dating part and headed straight to the home run.

189
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:38,389
I'm kind of to blame. I shouldn't have believed the crap Su Zhinian said that day.

190
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:41,289
You know about that guy's dark history.

191
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:44,170
There's enough to make a dictionary.

192
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,500
I still can't figure out what exactly he likes about me.

193
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,929
Do you really need a reason to like someone?

194
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,049
At least I can't tell what's great about Song Qingchun that made you so infatuated with her.

195
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,950
I'm glad you couldn't tell.

196
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,649
Otherwise, did you think you'd still be sitting here?

197
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,789
What? Are you going to severe the father and son ties?

198
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,910
Too bad she thinks you're old.

199
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,390
Do you also think

200
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,960
that I look old?

201
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,160
He's not old. He's old-fashioned, but at least he's got okay looks.

202
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,439
I just wanted to annoy him a little.

203
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,310
But aren't you and Director Su already a couple?

204
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,410
Why are you making him jealous then? Is it to test if he really likes you?

205
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,390
This is called spicing things up.

206
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,610
Or it could be a game between man and woman.

207
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,720
The Qinghu project is quite promising.

208
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,229
Does that mean you're interested in the project?

209
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:55,029
But from what I heard, you still want to think about it.

210
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:58,710
If I hadn't taken my time, how could I have gotten you to come out today?

211
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,880
I thought you weren't coming.

212
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,230
You didn't just pass by, right, Director Su?

213
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,690
No. Geiger Capital has plans to invest in extreme sports.

214
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,250
Okay.

215
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,960
This segment does have a promising market.

216
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,890
Director Su. Excellent choice.

217
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,430
Brother Yinan.

218
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,430
Director Su asked me to come.

219
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,770
This is...

220
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,409
Qin Yinan. Head of legal department from Huateng Land.

221
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:35,930
Nice to meet you.

222
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,029
Since Director Su is interested in extreme sport, what about we have a match?

223
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:42,449
We are all young people. Let's have some fun.

224
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:44,780
There are four of us, so two in a group.

225
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,169
It's Director Song's first time. Since I know a thing or two, we'll make a fair team.

226
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,290
You guys okay with that?

227
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,890
Fine with me.

228
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,379
- Me too.
- I object.

229
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:56,629
Invalid objection. The majority wins.

230
00:18:56,629 --> 00:19:01,289
It's set then. By the way, the loser has to foot the bill.

231
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,920
Don't you want to team up with me?

232
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,730
I prefer to kick your butt.

233
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,990
Let's warm up.

234
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,610
Warm up your muscles since it's your first time.

235
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,390
Indoor rock climbing is actually very simple.

236
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,129
The key is to use the strength from your legs.

237
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:30,600
It's not only about the arm strength. Remember to use your legs and feet too.

238
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,920
Okay.

239
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,949
Especially when you're up there.

240
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,909
Director Chen may be older than Qingchun, but they seem to get along well. There's no age gap.

241
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,580
Ram dressed as lamb.

242
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,429
Feeling jealous? Then why didn't you stop her just now?

243
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,470
If you hadn't agreed, I wouldn't have to endure this scene.

244
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,089
So what if I had disagreed? The point is, Qingchun is fine with it.

245
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:54,250
Just do your job. There's not a lot of time left to do what you've promised me.

246
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:59,979
Later, I'll climb first. Watch my route and where the holds are.

247
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,490
- Okay?
- Okay.

248
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,190
- Relax. Enjoy it.
- I'll be fine.
- Are the climbers ready?

249
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,590
Ready.

250
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,750
Start!

251
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,090
Go, go!

252
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,080
Hurry, Chen Han!

253
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,130
Quick.

254
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,810
Hurry.

255
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,030
Stay calm.

256
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,150
You wanted to kick my butt, right?

257
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,649
If I beat you, you will take me to watch the Perseid meteor shower tomorrow night.

258
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:21,810
Okay. If you can reach the top, I'll go with you.

259
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,180
I can do it.

260
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,090
Su Zhinian.

261
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,690
Qingchun!

262
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,430
Careful.

263
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,309
- Slowly.
- Slowly now.

264
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,750
Slowly.

265
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,880
Are you okay?

266
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,450
It's okay. You're safe. Calm yourself. Take a deep breath.

267
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,330
It was you, wasn't it?

268
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,390
Should we take you to the hospital?

269
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,790
It's okay.

270
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,670
You did something.

271
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,719
What? Are you going to report me?

272
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:34,340
Don't forget. We are on the same side.

273
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,330
Get that in your head.

274
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,829
Chen Han. This is my last warning to you.

275
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,599
You're using me to get back at Su Zhinian. That's fine.

276
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,819
But if it implicates Qingchun, then I'm not going to let you off.

277
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,319
Director Qin. Why are you so worked up?

278
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:56,150
What happened just now was an accident.

279
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,810
The one I'm after is Su Zhinian. There's no point in me harming Ms. Song.

280
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,870
So you didn't do it?

281
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,730
I told you. That was just a safety incident. Investigate it if you won't believe me.

282
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,759
Then what exactly are you after trying to cozy up to Qingchun?

283
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,019
Don't worry. I will never be your love rival.

284
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,330
As for you, why did Su Zhinian suddenly ask you to come?

285
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,730
Is he starting to suspect you?

286
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,890
Don't you change the subject.

287
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,549
You think I know nothing about your background?

288
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,449
Did you really come back just to go after Su Zhinian?

289
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,729
Director Qin. Sometimes, it's better not to know so much.

290
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,660
Just remember this.

291
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,329
Everything I'm doing is to help you cover up the Pearl Residence contract.

292
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,500
Also, all the shady things you did at Huateng,

293
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,060
do you really think you can handle it alone?

294
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,710
I don't need you to meddle in my business.

295
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,050
You better remember my warning.

296
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
What's that?

297
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,059
Superman didn't really have to hide the truth.

298
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:37,329
Women's scope of acceptance shouldn't be underestimated.

299
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:42,159
Whether it is an alien, a mutant, or some kind of monster.

300
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,470
So long as it treats us with sincerity, we don't really care about the so-called species divide.

301
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,490
Am I right?

302
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,970
We're here.

303
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,900
Don't you have anything to say to me?

304
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,760
I don't want you to contact Chen Han again.

305
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,069
The partnership with Yangguang Capital should be terminated soon as well.

306
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:06,459
You can't just leave a business deal hanging there and leave.

307
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,240
Qinghu is breaking ground soon.

308
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,079
The whole company is working overtime on the project.

309
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,410
We can't afford any more problems right now.

310
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,779
I will take care of the finance.

311
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,520
You've done enough for the company.

312
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,660
So I'll handle the matter this time.

313
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,279
Chen Han feels bad about what happened.

314
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,800
It's my chance to get us a good deal.

315
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,160
You always said that I should know what kind of responsibilities I bear, right?

316
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,980
I know now. So I want to bear it on my own.

317
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,530
You have 30 minutes.

318
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,619
Whether you succeed or not, you have to come back.

319
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,969
Su Zhinian. This outfit doesn't suit you.

320
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,980
What's wrong with it?

321
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,921
A yellowed cucumber painted green.
(T/N: Ram dressed as lamb.)

322
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,120
This is clearly yellow paint.

323
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,260
You really need glasses.

324
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,829
Nonetheless, the yellowed cucumber was so cool today.

325
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:09,800
So swell!

326
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,150
Countdown of 30 minutes starts...

327
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,750
now.

328
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,640
Qingchun. Where is Su Zhinian?

329
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,080
He's at the car.

330
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,040
I think you're getting too cozy with Director Chen.

331
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,829
We need to rethink our partnership with Yangguang.

332
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,609
Brother Yinan. I know what to do.

333
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,839
The deal with Yangguang Capital is my first independent assignment.

334
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,660
It's important to me.

335
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,799
Director Chen.

336
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,500
Director Song.

337
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm really sorry about just now.

338
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,600
I guess I'll have to foot the bill today.

339
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,840
A little something as an apology.

340
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,340
If not because of me, you wouldn't have gotten such a fright.

341
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm really sorry.

342
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,869
Then I'll accept the gift. You don't have to apologize.

343
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:29,339
It wasn't your fault. It was an accident.

344
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,079
The staff from the climbing center said that it was just a problem with the clip.

345
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,479
I should be blamed too. I didn't check the harness properly.

346
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,260
You two chat.

347
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,450
I need to use the restroom.

348
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,380
As long as you don't hold any grudge against me.

349
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,360
Open it and see if you like it.

350
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,519
I heard you're a fan of the brand. So I specifically ordered a limited edition.

351
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,840
It even has a voice recording function.

352
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,149
Thank you, Director Chen. I really like the gift.

353
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,699
But, I already have the exact same one.

354
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:07,929
Why don't you take this one back?

355
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,019
You can give it to another enthusiast. Don't let it go to waste.

356
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,619
I hope you didn't make up an excuse just to turn me down.

357
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,899
Of course, not. The one I have was a birthday present from my dad.

358
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:23,539
To me, that one is one of a kind.

359
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,010
I've heard about what happened to your dad.

360
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,370
What a shock it must have been.

361
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,420
But you're very capable. Your dad must be proud.

362
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,179
To be honest, I have great admiration for young go-getters like you.

363
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:45,340
To have you at the helm of the Qinghu project puts me at ease.

364
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,240
Does that mean you've made up your mind?

365
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,539
So can we put a stamp on the contract?

366
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:55,000
So that's what this is about.

367
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,350
It's not that I can't sign it tonight.

368
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
But...

369
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,220
You have to beat me first.

370
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,790
If I don't?

371
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,979
Then I'd have to trouble you to continue showing me around Jiangli.

372
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,170
Okay.

373
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
Are you okay, Director Song?

374
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,840
I'm okay. Your turn.

375
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,279
- Please.
- Looks like you're down on luck today.

376
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,589
You're very good.

377
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,430
I play it sometimes.

378
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,299
Honestly, I'm looking forward to seeing you again tomorrow.

379
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,390
Don't go in. Don't go in.

380
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,249
Director Su. Didn't you have something else to do?

381
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:43,220
It's finished. So I came to pick her up.

382
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,800
Don't tease me now.

383
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,459
It's not like you don't know. I'm bad at Math, especially geometric angles.

384
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,430
My bad for not teaching you well.

385
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,330
Relax your hand.

386
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,760
Look at the center of the cue ball.

387
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,089
The optimal distance between the stick and the cue ball is 18 centimeters.

388
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,090
Aim towards the right pocket.

389
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,860
Then adjust the central axis.

390
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,290
Good shot.

391
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,320
Director Su is very good.

392
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,920
A pro indeed.

393
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,280
But the prerequisite for signing the contract is that Ms. Song beats me.

394
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,419
It's the last ball. Do you want to continue?

395
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,920
Didn't he say the point you helped me with didn't count?

396
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,159
Director Chen. I'll be straight with you.

397
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,319
Actually, before you took over Yangguang Capital, we have been in negotiation for some time.

398
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,819
Be it the return on investment or Huateng's ability to manage the project,

399
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,989
both parties have already come to a consensus.

400
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,269
I prefer to hear about this when we meet again tomorrow.

401
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,580
Su Zhinian.

402
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,840
At least let me say goodbye.

403
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,129
You won't meet again. No chance.

404
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,789
Get me the recording of the pool game just now and all videos related to Su Zhinian.

405
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,390
Put them in order.

406
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,619
Su Zhinian. Su Zhinian!

407
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:36,416
Su Zhinian. You really have a temper problem.

408
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,880
Su Zhinian!

409
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,479
What happened to your imposing "you won't meet again" attitude?

410
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,380
What's the matter? Are you unwell?

411
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,960
Get in.

412
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,560
I'll leave the matter to you then.

413
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,859
Sure. I'll get them to arrange it.

414
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,360
This way.

415
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,320
Let me go.

416
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,890
So this is what you're busy with?

417
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,010
You refused to help me. That's why I looked for someone who will.

418
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,890
If you're worried that I might do something wrong and embarrass you, don't fret.

419
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,079
I haven't stooped so low.

420
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
What happened to you?

421
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,130
Are you disappointed?

422
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,400
But this is how I've always been.

423
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,439
It's just that you have never tried to understand me.

424
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,719
Also because I didn't want to annoy you.

425
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,789
So I never showed resentment or complained in front of you.

426
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,820
Nuan Nuan. I was wrong.

427
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,450
- I will—
- No.

428
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,810
I asked to be burned.

429
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,989
I knew you didn't like me and yet I still went for it.

430
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,260
I saw Qingchun downstairs.

431
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,240
Go on.

432
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,590
I'm going in.

433
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,540
I came here with Qingchun to go over a deal with Yangguang's new general manager.

434
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,519
- You can come with me if you don't believe me.
- It doesn't matter.

435
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,240
My superior is still inside.

436
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
I don't have connections.

437
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,280
So I can't afford to cross my superior and sponsors.

438
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,620
Yangguang's Director Chen is downstairs.

439
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,720
I can help you get the sponsor. Is that okay?

440
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,610
Here.

441
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,120
Why are you the only one here, Director Chen?

442
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,090
She is...

443
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,879
She is my girlfriend, Tang Nuan. An anchor at Jiangli TV.

444
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,050
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Director Chen.

445
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,150
Do you not like Director Chen?

446
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,879
I'm sorry. It was my bad. I shouldn't have used him to annoy him.

447
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,330
- I only wanted—
- We can talk again tomorrow.

448
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,780
I'm a little tired.

449
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,550
Are you okay?

450
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,719
Su Zhinian. There's obviously something wrong with you.

451
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,210
Can you not keep everything to yourself?

452
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,080
I can wait if you won't tell me now.

453
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,580
I said I was fine.

454
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,210
Stop following me.

455
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,759
Jerk. What did you lash out at me for?

456
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:59,139
I'm not going back on my own. I'll give you 10 minutes.

457
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,729
If the headache still persists, you must tell me.

458
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:22,089
If needed, you'll need to seek treatment overseas.

459
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,209
Otherwise, if the brain can no longer withstand such immense mind power, it will be totally wrecked.

460
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,950
Qingchun. Qingchun!

461
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,930
♫  In the end, I can only watch you  ♫

462
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:18,860
♫  walk towards happiness as I'm just a guest  ♫

463
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,590
♫  A love that I can't grasp  ♫

464
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,690
♫  Making promises I can't fulfill  ♫

465
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,500
♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

466
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,280
♫  The encounters we had  ♫

467
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:49,700
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart  ♫

468
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,660
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

469
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,040
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

470
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:07,630
♫  I'll continue to search by myself  ♫

471
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,460
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

472
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,410
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

473
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:23,030
♫  What can tear two hearts that beats as one  ♫

474
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,660
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

475
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:32,020
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

476
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:38,050
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

477
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,960
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

478
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,990
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

479
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:53,279
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

480
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:57,200
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

481
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,080
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

482
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:09,760
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
