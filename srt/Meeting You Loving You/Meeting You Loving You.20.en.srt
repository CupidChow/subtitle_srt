00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,749
[Episode 20]

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,999
No wonder he said so many weird things that day.

21
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,570
[Renji Hospital]

22
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,590
He wasn't only confessing to me.

23
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,740
He's also saying goodbye to me.

24
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,505
So he already decided not to do the operation, right?

25
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,280
So all the good things we experienced that day are

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,960
the memories he left for himself.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,830
As for me,

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,008
he would erase everything related to him from my memories.

29
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:16,920
How did you know?

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,260
It wasn't the first time he did that to me.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,570
Based on his condition, he shouldn't have used his superpower anymore.

32
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,779
Doing that will only make his condition worse.

33
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:30,180
It's no different from committing suicide.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,820
But he still did it because he cares about you.

35
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,400
Is there still time for the operation?

36
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,840
Does he still have hope?

37
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,440
We have a 20% of success rate.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,590
Have you arranged for the operation?

39
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,590
He'll depart this weekend at the latest.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,270
I want to see him one more time.

41
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,779
Hurry up.

42
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,700
Or else, we'll miss the sunset.

43
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,929
Why did you ask me to go hiking all of a sudden?

44
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:23,530
Did the hospital fire you,

45
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,930
or did my assistant dump you?

46
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,309
Oh, give me a break.

47
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,020
Do you think I'm like you, who'd ditch your friend over your girlfriend?

48
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,399
Would she give me the silent treatment if it weren't for you?

49
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,469
What do you want, then?

50
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,749
Let's race.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,250
See who reaches the peak of the mountain first.

52
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,389
No turning back midway.

53
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,939
Sure. The loser will walk back.

54
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,690
Deal.

55
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,930
You're here.

56
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,880
What do you want again?

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,909
I'm treating you to a hotpot and watching the sunset with you.

58
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,850
Thanks.

59
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,820
You didn't tell Yan Yuan to trick me

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,100
into coming here just for hotpot, right?

61
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,629
Of course not.

62
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:34,919
We're going to watch the sunset and gaze at the stars too.

63
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,949
Since you're already here, why don't we eat while we chat?

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,109
Su Zhinian, are annoyed by me in the past few days?

65
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,560
I thought you didn't know.

66
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,239
Then you probably didn't read "Way of Speaking," which I gave you.

67
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,460
It's already boiling.

68
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,149
Look. Is that star called

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,260
Orion?

70
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,820
That's Scorpio.

71
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,190
That was not what you said before.

72
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,979
Maybe I was being thoughtful of your feelings at the time.

73
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,449
The truth is, Scorpio and Orion were natural enemies.

74
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,830
Orion, the son of the God of the Sea, Poseidon, always bragged

75
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,150
that there was nothing that he couldn't hunt.

76
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,139
His arrogance had brought the wrath of the Queen of Gods, Hera.

77
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,019
So she sent a poisonous scorpion to punish Orion.

78
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,380
Orion was placed among the stars after he died,

79
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,699
and that scorpion has become a star known as "Scorpio."

80
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,759
Isn't it about the tragic love story between Orion and the Goddess of the Moon, Artemis?

81
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,500
That's another version of the myth.

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,039
You can't see it in the sky on a summer night.

83
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,910
Orion only appears in winter.

84
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,919
That's where the saying of "it's hard to meet again as life goes on, like the morning and evening stars" comes from.

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,020
"It's hard to meet again as life goes on?"

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,640
- That's not what I meant.
- I won't bother you anymore.

87
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,899
Are you two ready?

88
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,210
Yes.

89
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,800
Action!

90
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,340
Who makes the decision at home?

91
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,690
Who's clumsier?

92
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,930
Who's richer?

93
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,150
Who's lazier?

94
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,410
Who's the annoying one?

95
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,040
Who takes the initiative in the relationship?

96
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,700
Who likes the other more?

97
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,500
Let the past stay in the past.

98
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,830
I shouldn't have bothered you again.

99
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,000
So I'll learn

100
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,630
to let go of the past.

101
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,780
Su Zhinian,

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,930
I agree to break up with you.

103
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,500
After all, love is like an investment.

104
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,760
Other than stopping losses,

105
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,540
one needs to apply the Pareto principle to improve,

106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,240
so that neither party will be troubled.

107
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,120
It seems like I've taught you a lot in the past.

108
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,890
I hope you'll keep your word

109
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,660
and stop bothering me.

110
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,670
Goodbye,

111
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,750
Su Zhinian.

112
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,960
Liar! Get out of my way!

113
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,780
Stop it already.

114
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,330
A relationship is between two people.

115
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,330
There's no way we can get involved in other people's relationships.

116
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,920
Can we not let other people's relationships affect us?

117
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,749
Director Su and Director Song aren't like the others.

118
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,029
They're my best friends.

119
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,410
Legend Su is also my best friend.

120
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,669
He chose to do the operation.

121
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,749
Be it his doctor or his friend,

122
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,650
there's no reason to stop him.

123
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,460
Besides, this is what Song Qingchun wants.

124
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,010
In any case, you did lie to me.

125
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,100
I apologize for what I did, okay?

126
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,670
Can't you consider the fact that I'm having a hard time being caught

127
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,300
in between the three of you

128
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,530
and forgive me?

129
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,320
It's your fault.

130
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,850
Are you still mad?

131
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,999
- Are you?
- Get lost!

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,510
Are you?

133
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,060
Fine! I'm not mad anymore.

134
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,979
Good girl. Stop being mad.

135
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,980
Later, I'll take you somewhere nice to eat.

136
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,060
I'm starving anyway.

137
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,250
I'll forgive you if you can catch up with me.

138
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,480
Cheng Qingcong!

139
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,909
Wait for me!

140
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,730
Cheng Qingcong!

141
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,960
Director Chen, Su Zhinian is up to something.

142
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,529
What do you mean?

143
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,930
It seems Song Qingchun is breaking up with him.

144
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,299
Song Qingchun moved out of his house two days ago.

145
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,780
Keep an eye on them.

146
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,430
Let's see what they're up to, especially Su Zhinian.

147
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,920
Yes.

148
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,430
Does this look pretty?

149
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,030
What about this one?

150
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,040
I'll take another look.

151
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,079
Oh, yes. I've picked out some hotels.

152
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,689
After we're done trying out the wedding dress, we can go for the food tasting.

153
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,410
If all goes well, we can book the hotel first.

154
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,819
Lest it's fully booked if we book the last minute.

155
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,220
All right. Anything you want.

156
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,100
This dress is pretty too.

157
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,220
It'll look good on you. Do you want to try it on?

158
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,139
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

159
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:28,930
My girlfriend wants to try out this wedding dress.

160
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,100
All right. Come this way, please.

161
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,409
Let's go.

162
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:35,980
This way.

163
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,890
Come in.

164
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,400
Director Song.

165
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,750
This is the information related to Shenghua Construction that Director Su asked me to investigate before.

166
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,650
Li Damin indeed fabricated the account statement

167
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,970
to create a false impression that Shenghua Construction is a high-quality company.

168
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,630
How come my father overlook these data?

169
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,990
I've asked the Legal Department and Risk Control about this matter.

170
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,110
They claimed Chairman Song didn't instruct them to conduct investigations relating to that matter.

171
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,539
But at that time, Huateng and Geiger were in the process of signing a contract.

172
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,830
So we can't rule out that Chairman Song was worried it might affect the deal.

173
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,770
That's why he put the matter aside.

174
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,519
All right. I understand. Get back to work.

175
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,200
[Li Damin]

176
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,050
[Qin Yinan]

177
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,719
How do I look? Do I look pretty?

178
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:00,140
Very pretty.

179
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,600
You look gorgeous.

180
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,329
What's wrong?

181
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,029
- Let me take this call.
- Okay. Go ahead.

182
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,529
This wedding dress is our new arrival.

183
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:13,589
It was designed by a famous designer.

184
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,199
Hello, Qingchun. What's the matter?

185
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,719
Uncle Song may have already found out that Shenghua Construction is shady from the beginning?

186
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,890
Calm down. I'll be right over.

187
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,050
We'll take a look at the groom's suit later.

188
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,360
Okay.

189
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,999
You look gorgeous. It looks good on you.

190
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,999
- Thank you.
- It's hard for one to look elegant in this dress.

191
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,690
But you look gorgeous in this dress.

192
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
I'll pick this one, then.

193
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,480
All right.

194
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,329
Did you say Uncle Song already knew that Shenghua Construction is shady from the beginning?

195
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:09,860
What happened?

196
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,850
I'm not sure of the details.

197
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,430
This is the information Zheng Hao has found.

198
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,050
Since Uncle Song knew about it, why did he acquire it?

199
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,529
I'm guessing he was afraid it might affect his deal with Geiger.

200
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,490
So he skipped the legality and risk control process.

201
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,530
I asked you here to ask you

202
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,050
if my dad mentioned this to you.

203
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,020
After all, he trusted you the most in this aspect.

204
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,690
Uncle Song did call me.

205
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,260
But he didn't say anything much.

206
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,859
I was busy with another project, so I didn't ask for the details.

207
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,269
Who else could he talk to?

208
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,800
[Tang Nuan]

209
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,720
Do you have other clues?

210
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,350
Yes.

211
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,320
Li Damin has an intimate friend.

212
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,499
He transferred most of the funds to her account.

213
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,479
But after Li Damin got into trouble, she went into hiding.

214
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,890
I think she knows something.

215
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,930
Director Song, I found the contact details you wanted.

216
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,510
Send it to my phone.

217
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,260
The interviewee is here too.

218
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,650
Do you want to do the interview yourself?

219
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,760
I'll be right over.

220
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,059
Brother Yinan, I'll be back soon. Wait for me.

221
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,530
Okay.

[Tang Nuan]

224
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,559
Sorry about that. It took me some time.

225
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,650
Zheng Hao has sent the contact details to me.

226
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,510
If there's any update, I'll contact you again.

227
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,480
All right. I'll get going, then.

[Qin Yinan]

229
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,470
Qin Yinan has left.

230
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,019
Did you call him here?

231
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes. Any problem?

232
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,369
Just one call from you made my fiance leave me all alone at the bridal shop

233
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:08,049
and turned me into a laughing stock.

234
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,150
Don't you think there's a problem with that?

235
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,020
I didn't know you were getting married.

236
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,500
He didn't tell me over the phone.

237
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,630
Of course, he wouldn't tell you.

238
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,759
When we started dating,

239
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,570
he did his best to hide it from you

240
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,950
so he could keep flirting with you.

241
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,580
Before this, I always thought you had never treated me as your friend.

242
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,649
I had no idea you had been treating me as an imaginary enemy.

243
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:32,570
I've told you I hope you'll be happy together.

244
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,659
It was never a lie.

245
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,639
I called him here today because he was involved in some business matter here.

246
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:42,589
What business matters need the two of you to stay together all the time?

247
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,319
You're just showing off your charm, aren't you?

248
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,309
Since we were kids, everything that was rightfully mine

249
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,460
has disappeared because of your background.

250
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,750
Is it because your father is Song Menghua that you can show your superiority in front of me?

251
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,399
If you're saying all these because of Qin Yinan,

252
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:01,559
I can tell you that I wished more than you

253
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,009
that the person I liked from the very beginning was Su Zhinian.

254
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,670
I don't care if you believe me or not.

255
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,320
I never took anything of yours.

256

Not now, not ever.

257
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,320
I don't know which one of us is more pathetic.

258
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,879
Tang Nuan, you made such presumptions because you feel inferior.

259
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,660
Me? Pathetic?

260
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,010
Do you think everyone around you really likes you?

261
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,339
Or do you really think Li Damin was the one who drugged you?

262
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,439
Stop drinking. Come home with me.

263
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,190
Just let me drink this time.

264
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,730
Or else I won't be able to hold on anymore.

265
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,469
Hello? Is this Su Zhinian?

266
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,099
Come and pick me. I'm drunk!

267
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,290
Director Song, did you call the wrong number?

268
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,990
You said you've let it go.

269
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,030
I can't let go. I can't let it go!

270
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,779
I can never let it go!

271
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,029
Who told you I could let it go?

272
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,149
Let me talk to him.

273
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,130
I'll talk to him.

274
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,040
Hello, Director Su.

275
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,839
We're at a bistro along Yulin Street.

276
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,150
Come now.

277
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,060
If you don't, we both will be dead.

278
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,330
These two are unbelievable.

279
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,390
Don't drink so much if you can't handle it.

280
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,599
Let's go.

281
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,320
I need to go to the toilet.

282
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,940
I want to go to the toilet.

283
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,560
I'll take you there.

284
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,519
Qingchun, wait here for a while.

285
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,190
Okay.

286
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,179
Go away.

287
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:23,990
Are you alone?

288
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,630
Su Zhinian?

289
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,860
Are you here to pick me up?

290
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,039
I knew you wouldn't forget me.

291
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,700
Carry me!

292
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,840
You're drunk as a skunk.

293
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,729
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

294
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:56,050
Do you have a teeny bit of feelings for me now?

295
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,210
You're sure good at talking nonsense when you're drunk.

296
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,810
Su Zhinian, you're too much.

297
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,629
You made me feel

298
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,770
I have the best man in the world.

299
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,429
But you've forgotten everything!

300
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,940
Do you know what people call this?

301
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,660
It's killing people without burying them!

302
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,390
Tell me, where do you want me to bury you?

303
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,470
Your ancestral grave.

304
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,359
I'm sorry. I'm an orphan.

305
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,739
Would it kill you to not talk back?

306
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:25,220
Yes.

307
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,610
But I don't want you to die.

308
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,470
I won't talk back to you anymore, okay?

309
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,860
But there's nothing I can do.

310
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,209
If there's nothing you can do, just don't do anything, then.

311
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:51,059
The person who truly cares about you won't let you do anything.

312
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,599
We're home now.

313
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,180
Can you walk in yourself?

314
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,560
Su Zhinian, you kissed me again.

315
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,280
Where have you been? Why didn't you answer your phone?

316
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,050
I've been looking for you all afternoon.

317
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:43,310
Qin Yinan, please stop acting.

318
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,800
You make me sick.

319
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,280
What are you talking about?

320
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,700
I want

321
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,390
to break up with you.

322
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,829
You always cast me aside because of Song Qingchun.

323
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,229
I can explain what happened in the afternoon.

324
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,260
- I...
- I don't want to hear it anymore.

325
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,130
You've said enough.

326
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,660
Which of those words are true?

327
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,669
I'm truly ridiculous when I think about it.

328
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:15,800
In front of others,

329
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,360
I can endure bullies because of that ridiculous self-esteem.

330
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,979
The only person who can make me let go of my ego is you.

331
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,770
But I still end up in this state.

332
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,150
I guess you still don't know.

333
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,359
I was the one who took the picture you received before this.

334
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,280
I asked someone to deliver it to you on purpose.

335
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,760
I did it

336
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,190
so that I can be with you.

337
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,630
You must be disappointed with me, right?

338
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,820
But this is who I am.

339
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,380
Also,

340
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,369
I met Song Qingchun just now.

341
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,110
I told her what you did in the past.

342
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,810
So save your explanation to her.

343
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,760
Why am I here?

344
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,090
Stop right there.

345
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,390
Are you going to leave just like that?

346
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,089
I'm sorry about last night.

347
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:50,349
You were so hammered that you barged into my house without permission.

348
00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:51,660
Is this what you meant by not going to bother me anymore?

349
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,229
Didn't you change your door's password?

350
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:56,899
Why should I change my living habit because of you?

351
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,689
Well... I'm sorry about that. I'll take my leave, then.

352
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,620
Wait.

353
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,600
Pay your bills before you go.

354
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,710
What bills?

355
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,120
[Bill. Total 1,999 yuan]

356
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,749
WeChat Pay or Alipay. Take your pick.

357
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,230
Done. I've transferred the money.

358
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,689
Thanks. I transferred one extra yuan.

359
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,040
What now?

360
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,500
I've already transferred the money to you.

361
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,330
So it's none of your business.

362
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,019
Never let anything you see or hear change your aspirations.

363
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,889
I will always root for you.

364
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:06,630
I didn't know you are a kid-at-heart, Chairman Song.

365
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,770
Who are you? Who let you in here?

366
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,749
Who am I? Do you really not know?

367
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:15,690
Sorry, I really don't know you.

368
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,670
You've mistaken me for someone else.

369
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,640
Let me remind you of it, Chairman Song.

370
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,060
Do you remember how you took hold of my father's shares

371
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,800
after he died and drove a pitiful widow

372
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,290
and her son to desperation 14 years ago?

373
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,730
Nonsense.

374
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,770
When did I...

375
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,040
You're Zhong Qian's illegitimate son.

376
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,490
So you remember now.

377
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,010
You know what?

378
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,870
A helpless young woman

379
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,700
who had to take care of her innocent child

380
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,329
had to endure humiliation, become an outcast,

381
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,280
and be ridiculed just to survive.

382
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,590
All of these happened because of you.

383
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:25,009
I've waited for 14 years before I could appear in front of you like this today.

384
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,830
Zhong Qian passed away too suddenly back then.

385
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,570
He didn't leave a word behind.

386
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,040
I didn't know of your existence.

387
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,920
If you're here for Huateng's share,

388
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,670
don't worry. As long as I've verified your identity,

389
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,019
you'll have your share transferred to your account.

390
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,030
You didn't know of my existence?

391
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,940
Do you think Huateng is still that valuable?

392
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,710
What do you mean by that?

393
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,119
Didn't you notice there's something wrong with Shenghua Construction long ago?

394
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,900
So you were the one behind this.

395
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,759
I'm not the only one.

396
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,129
It's all thanks to your trusted friend, Li Damin.

397
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:31,090
Also, the junior you value the most, Lawyer Qin.

398
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,440
Otherwise, my plan wouldn't go so smoothly.

399
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,420
Why would you do that?

400
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,350
I've never done anything bad to you.

401
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,280
This is only the beginning.

402
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,919
I'll make you pay double the amount that you owe my mom and me.

403
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,420
If I can't get enough from you,

404
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,129
I'll claim the rest from your daughter

405
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:59,420
until I'm fully satisfied.

406
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,330
You wouldn't dare!

407
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,840
If you touch my daughter, I'm going to...

408
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,079
Rock climbing sounds good.

409
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,870
I like rock climbing too.

410
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,380
Take it as a token of my apology.

411
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,040
It was him.

412
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,389
Hello.

413
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:46,290
Director Su, I've emailed you

414
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,040
what I found out about Chen Han's identity

415
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,020
and the information about his illegal activities.

416
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,279
All right. Keep an eye on him.

417
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,273
[Chen Han's background. Song Zhongqian's illegitimate son, Chen Han.
Song Menghua's brother Song Zhongqian.]

418
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,360
(Cousins?)

419
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,200
[Music]

420
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,329
Hello, Miss Song.

421
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,289
To what do I owe the pleasure of you calling me?

422
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:54,290
Director Chen, are you busy?

423
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,809
I want to see you about something.

424
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,290
What is it about?

425
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,659
I'll tell you when we meet.

426
00:32:58,659 --> 00:32:59,599
All right.

427
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,040
I'll send you my address.

428
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,390
All right.

429
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,210
Boss, Miss Song is here.

430
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,060
Director Chen.

431
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,659
How do you find this place?

432
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,690
Feel free to look around.

433
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,870
Not bad.

434
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,669
But this hobby of yours must cost you a fortune, right?

435
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,390
People need some hobbies in life.

436
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,559
So is there a reason you wanted to see me?

437
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,759
Yes. I need your help with something.

438
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,250
I'm listening.

439
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,089
My dad gave me this as my birthday present.

440
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:04,889
I think I've mentioned this to you before.

441
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:07,739
This morning, I accidentally dropped it in the water.

442
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:11,720
Then, I noticed there was a recorder in the bear.

443
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,949
The recorder might contain a message from my dad.

444
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,620
I didn't have the chance to listen to it.

445
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,969
This recording is very important to me.

446
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,009
I wondered if your friend, who custom-made this toy for you,

447
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:25,950
could repair this for me.

448
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,760
Can I take a look at it?

449
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,980
You can't hear anything at all?

450
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,130
How about this?

451
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,990
I'll make a call and ask about it.

452
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,719
Can you tell me where the washroom is?

453
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,989
Sun, show her the way.

454
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,860
Miss Song, this way, please.

455
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,670
Okay.

456
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,739
Why don't you send me the location?

457
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,330
Okay.

458
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,980
Thanks, Brother.

459
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I'll treat you to a meal someday.

460
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,739
I've called him.

461
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:25,449
So do you want me to return it to you after it's repaired,

462
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:28,210
or do you want to go by yourself? I can send the location to you.

463
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,409
If it's not too much trouble,

464
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:32,820
I'll leave it to you, then.

465
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,580
All right.

466
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,150
I'll text you after it's repaired.

467
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,679
Don't worry. I'll return it intact.

468
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,679
I'll definitely return the favor, Director Chen.

469
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,099
Why don't you stay for a meal?

470
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,199
I can't.

471
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,619
I have to get back to the office.

472
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,970
See?

473
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,259
They're rushing me to go back.

474
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:50,719
All right, then.

475
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,359
- Sun, see her out.
- Yes.

476
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,269
It's okay. I can go back myself.

477
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:55,800
Thanks.

478
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,360
Miss Song, see you.

479
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,479
Our men have received news that Su Zhinian is onto us.

480
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm guessing he already knows.

481
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,390
No wonder.

482
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,360
So she's here to test me.

483
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,690
Since we're exposed, there's no need to put up an act in front of them.

484
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,779
We'll make our move tonight and trap Su Zhinian.

485
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:35,210
All right.

486
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,010
Don't hurt him first.

487
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,589
I'm keeping this treasure for good use.

488
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,300
Understood.

489
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,760
- Hello, Su Zhinian.
- Where are you now?

490
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,159
I'm on my way to your house.

491
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,259
I have something important to tell you.

492
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:56,950
Is it about Chen Han?

493
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,389
You knew?

494
00:36:58,389 --> 00:36:59,740
We'll talk after you're here.

495
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,560
Okay.

496
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,910
Mister, can you please drive faster? Thanks.

497
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,570
All right.

498
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,420
[I'll wait for you. I have a surprise. Sender. Chen Han]

499
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,879
Su Zhinian! Su Zhinian.

500
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,030
Su Zhinian!

501
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,050
The small warehouse on the outskirts behind the mountain of Linyuan Road.

502
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,590
I'll be waiting for you!

503
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,760
It's been a while, Director Su.

504
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,889
Chen Han?

505
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:16,329
I'm truly sorry for using this way to make you come here.

506
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,920
Do you think these people can actually stop me?

507
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,279
Of course not. I want you to show me what you got.

''Passing Through Your Memories'' - Zheng Guofeng

509
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,240
♫  In the end, I can only watch you  ♫

510
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:24,039
♫  walk towards happiness as I'm just a guest  ♫

511
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,529
♫  A love that I can't grasp  ♫

512
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:33,769
♫  Making promises I can't fulfill  ♫

513
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:38,820
♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

514
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,500
♫  The encounters we had  ♫

515
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:54,429
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart  ♫

516
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,779
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

517
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:04,259
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

518
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:12,800
♫  I'll continue to search by myself  ♫

519
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,679
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

520
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:21,529
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

521
00:41:21,529 --> 00:41:28,049
♫  What can tear two hearts that beats as one  ♫

522
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:31,879
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

523
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:37,040
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

524
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,350
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

525
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,179
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

526
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:52,170
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

527
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:58,399
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

528
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:02,419
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

529
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:08,600
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

530
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,680
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
