[Episode 8]

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,100
Song Qingchun, what are you doing?

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,600
Making dinner. This is the Luosifen that has gained popularity on the internet.

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Well, it looks like only the egg is edible.

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Want to try it?

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay. Then, I'll let you have this.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
Don't waste it. It took me some time to cook it.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
Song Qingchun, what's wrong with you?

27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,600
How can you make the egg yolk with durian?

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,300
I'm going to add another condition immediately.

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,300
You're not allowed to make Luosifen at home again. And also durian and odd-smelling foods.

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Those are forbidden.

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,600
Well, this is the latest popular recipe on the internet.

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,500
I think using durian to make this doesn't look nice on plating.

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
So, I've racked my brain and improvised it.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,800
Look, it doesn't look awkward, right? It looks good, isn't it?

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
What about you give this a try?

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,900
I have complete faith in this.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
- After you've tasted it—
- No way.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
You will stop complaining.

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
I will not eat this.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,500
- I will never eat this.
- Come here.

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,600
How does it taste?

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,600
It doesn't taste as bad as I thought.

43
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,200
Well, are you still going to amend the agreement?

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,600
Or are you going to reconsider it after finishing this meal?

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Dr. Yan, do you like hotpot too?

46
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,200
Yes.

47
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,600
Director Su likes it too.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,300
What's the problem?

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,800
Nothing. I just feel that you two hit it off well.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,400
No, you two are like-minded.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Mind your own business.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Another pork brain, please.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,100
- Okay.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,000
I might have said that we should dine happily together.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,200
But you don't have to go all out.

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,600
Dr. Yan, is my face dirty?

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm thinking that with your appetite,

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,700
even if you don't work for Legend Su,

59
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,100
you might make a name for yourself in eating broadcast.

60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,600
I like to eat.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
But I prefer to separate my interests from work.

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,200
This way, my life and work will become simpler.

63
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,400
You use the money you earn to support your avocational interests.

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
Tell me. Besides eating, what else do you like to do?

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
I also like to go online and write...

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Write Weibo posts and browse video sites.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Yes.

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Hi, here's your roasted pork brain.

69
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
- Please enjoy.
- Okay.

70
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,000
So you're a homebody and glutton.

71
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes.

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
But I'm different from you.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,100
I'm particularly envious of those who turn their interests into their career.

74
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,600
Come on. Let me tell you a little secret.

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,200
My childhood dream was to become the guardian of Peppa.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
What did you say?

77
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
You don't get it?

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,300
Look, this association area of the brain

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,800
is associated with intelligence and mental activities.

80
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,000
Poor logical thinking and slow response are related to this part.

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Replenish your mind. It's all yours.

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Thank you.

83
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,400
Peppa knows everything.

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,900
You are the pig.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
This is your brain.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Delicious.

87
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,000
The soul seasoning of Luosifen.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,300
To add or not to add makes it heavenly apart.

89
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,200
Try it.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
How does it taste?

91
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Delicious.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500

93

Isn't this good?

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,100
We should be courageous to try new things.

95
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,600

Director Su managed to contact the resources at Dahua.

134

If our proposal is accepted,

we might get to cooperate with Dahua.

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,100
Okay.

163
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,600
Let's go.

164
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,400
Okay. Got it.

Yuan Yuan.

168
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,800
Since you're here, why don't you say hi?

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,900
What are you doing here?

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,800
I came here because I want to see you.

171
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,900
If... If there's nothing else, then I'll get going.

172
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

173
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,400
Don't you know what I want to do?

174
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
I'll shout if you don't stop.

175

Go ahead.

176
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,200
But how would you explain it?

177
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,400
For walking out from the general manager's office
in the wee hours.

178

Not here, please.

What are you scared of?

180
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,000
I've wanted to try it at another location.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
It's more exciting here.

182
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,700
Please.

183

Let go!

Come on. Don't be scared.

No!

Please! Stop it!

It's no use begging me. Come on.

188
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,200
What are you doing?

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What could I do?

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,800
I passed by and saw that Ni Yuan Yuan wasn't feeling well.

191
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,500
Ask her if you don't believe me.

192
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Yuan Yuan, it's okay.

193
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,500
Don't be afraid. You have me here. Just tell me the truth.

Director Song, I...

195
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,400
I might be suffering from hypoglycemia just now.

196
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
I felt a little dizzy.

197
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Secretary Chen held me up.

198
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,900
You're here late at night to give a helping hand instead of going home?

199
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,800
Since you are here, I will leave your staff with you.

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
I need to get going.

201
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Otherwise, if the tigress at my home loses her temper, it's hard to cool her down.

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm leaving.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,900
By the way, Director Song.

204
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,200
You have to take care of your colleagues' health too when you guys work overnight.

205
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,300
Your health is your most precious asset.

I'm leaving.

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,600
You...

209
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,700
Director Song, stop hitting him. Don't invite trouble to yourself.

210
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,600
You... Song Qingchun, why did you hit me?

211
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
So what? Scum!

212
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Do you have proof?

213
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll call the police. I'll call the police.

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
You... You witnessed it.

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,300
She... She hit me. You must testify for me later.

216
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,000
Yuan Yuan doesn't need to testify anything.

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,400
When the police arrive, I'll show them the security footage.

218
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,700
Not only will they see that I'd hit you but also what you'd done in a complete view.

219
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,400
Go ahead and call the police. Want me to help you?

220
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Director Song, how long have you been here?

221
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,100
You don't understand the situation here.

222
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
Let me teach you.

223
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,300
This is the executive floor.

224
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,200
To protect the privacy of the executives,

225
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,500
these cameras are never turned on.

226
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,600
Looks like I have some news to update you with.

227
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,500
This morning, I went to the Administration Department and debugged all the cameras.

228
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,900
All the cameras are turned on now.

229
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,000
With me at Huateng, everyone is equal.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
I don't care about the executives' bad habits.

231
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm wrong.

232
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
I was muddled.

233
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
You admit it?

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,800
You weren't giving a helping hand?

235
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,200
I admit. I was muddled.

236
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,800
You are magnanimous.

237
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
Such a thing... I will never do such a thing again.

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,100
Apologize to Yuan Yuan.

239
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm sorry.

the camera isn't turned on at all.

242
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Wait for your termination letter.

243
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
This...

244
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,600
Let's go, Yuan Yuan.

245
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Director Song, are you really going to fire Secretary Chen?

246
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Absolutely.

247
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,500
We have absolutely zero tolerance for sexual harassment in the workplace.

248
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,000
It'd be great if you'd joined earlier.

249
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,000
Secretary Chen is a habitual offender, right? You might not be the only victim.

250
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How do you know?

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,200
When he was caught red-handed, he looked indifferent.

252
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Why didn't you all report him to the company earlier?

253
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,400
Director Song, thank you very much.

254
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I don't know how to put it.

255
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,500
- I...
- It's okay. I get it.

256
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,900
Don't think about it. Everything will pass. Don't be afraid.

257
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,600
Let's go.

258
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm wrong. I... I was muddled.

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,200
You are magnanimous.

260
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,900
Such a thing... I will never do such a thing again.

261
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,600
Apologize to Yuan Yuan.

262
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,000
I thought it was a big issue.

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,400
Director Song, you want to take the hard road.

264
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,800
Or you want to take this opportunity to get rid of my people?

265
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Vice President Li, do you think this is a trivial matter?

266
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Fish begins to stink at the head.

267
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,500
I think for this kind of matter, it takes two to tango.

268
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,900
If punishment is meted out, both of them should be on it.

269
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Moreover, the ladies in our company dress up gorgeously nowadays.

270
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,100
Some even dress up sexily.

271
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,300
So, we should allow them to dress up but forbid us to disturb them?

272
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,300
As far as I know, Vice President Li, you have a daughter, right?

273
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,400
I hope she won't meet a boss like you when she starts working in a company.

274
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,500
- Director Song, you—
- Vice President Li.

275
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Qingchun, I suggest keeping this matter a low profile.

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,700
I will critique and teach Secretary Chen.

277
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,200
Forget about firing him.

278
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
It'll affect the company if it's blown out of proportion.

279
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
The situation at Huateng Land has just improved.

280
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,000
- It's unnecessary to—
- So, you think it's unnecessary, right?

281
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,800
It's not the first time Secretary Chen treated our female staff this way.

282
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,100
If Huateng didn't make its stand clear at this moment, then that's malice.

283
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,200
I have decided on this matter.

284
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,000
I reckon as the general manager of Huateng Land,

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,200
I hold some authority in firing a secretary who has done something wrong.

286
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,900
Director Su, take a look at this.

287
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
My dear colleagues.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,800
Firstly, I represent the company to sincerely apologize

289
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,600
for the incidents that have befallen our female staff

290
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
Short skirts shouldn't be the reason for sexual harassment all along.

291
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,400
From nine to five every day, you contribute your wisdom and sweat to Huateng Land.

292
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,200
But due to your gender, you often receive unfair treatment.

293
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Because you are a woman,

294
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,200
your effort in striving for excellence is often overlooked.

295
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Because you are a woman, wearing a beautiful short skirt

296
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,000
is viewed as deliberately seducing your male colleagues and supervisors.

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Because you are a woman, your kind smile

298
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,400
is interpreted as a love signal to male customers.

299
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,300
Because you are a woman, you are criticized for asking for trouble

300
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,900
when you encounter danger alone at night.

301
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,200
This is not just a prejudice.

302
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,700
This is malice from a male-dominated society.

303
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,600
It tries to make us feel ashamed and keep our silence.

304
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
And we eventually become its accomplice.

305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,010
Today, I'd like to let you know that if you are sexually harassed

306
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,400
wherever you are, you don't have to keep your silence.

307
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,800
You don't have to do a self-reflection.

308
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,300
Those who harm you are just pretending that they don't understand it.

309
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,240
However we dress, wherever we go,

310
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,829
yes means yes. No means no.

311
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:12,199
I know that firing a sexual harasser will not solve the problem from its root.

312
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:17,039
But I hope that from now on, ladies, you may wear whatever you want.

313
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,780
Go wherever you want.

314
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,739
If you want, keep a smile always.

315
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:25,399
Protecting you from harm is the responsibility of this society.

316
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:29,139
Wish us freedom, unity, and becoming more powerful.

317
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:32,070
Yours sincerely, Song Qingchun.

Your turn is after Liuxing. Are you nervous?

A little. It's fine.

Bring out the demeanor you possessed when you released the staff memo yesterday.

Everything will be fine. All the best.

Next, I will announce the rules.

336

This time, the successful bidder

337
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,230
will cooperate with us, Wancheng Group,

338
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,020
to develop the Qinghu project.

339
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,360
Now, Impression Qinghu tender officially begins.

340
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,869
First, let us invite the tender representative of the Liuxing Office, Director Yu, to present on stage.

341
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,910
Welcome.

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,390
I need to go to the washroom now.

343

Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

344
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,299
First of all, on behalf of Liuxing Group,

345
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,580
I'd like to thank Director Lin of Wancheng Group.

346
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,490
- Yuan Yuan?
- I'm sorry, Director Song. I have something that I must tell you now.

347
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,389
What is it? Tell me.

348
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:07,589
I was instructed by Li Damin to steal our company's plan.

349
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,949
He has sold the plan to Liuxing Group's Director Yu.

350
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:13,760
What? Li Damin asked you to steal the plan?

351
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,780
The biggest selling point of our creativity

352
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,389
is to combine the two dimensions with the ancient town business

353
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:23,819
to provide an immersive experience to the customers.

Director Song, I know I'd made a big mistake.

355
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,259
I will tender my resignation letter to the company tomorrow.

356
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,300
We'll talk about your matter later.

357

Thank you for waiting.

Due to some technical issues in our plan,

I hereby announce

that Huateng Land will officially withdraw from Impression Qinghu tender.

What? Is she horsing around?

She's here to sabotage Wancheng's event.

I heard that before Song Menghua's accident,

his daughter has never been involved

in Huateng Land's business.

Huateng Land suddenly announced its withdrawal at the tender today.

384

Do you know the real reason behind this?

385
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,469
- Yes. Share with us.
- I don't know.

386

And I don't want to know.

387
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,929
What Huateng Land did today was very unprofessional.

388
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:11,709
There's one thing I am certain of.

389
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:16,309
We, Wancheng Group, will never cooperate with such a company.

Song Qingchun, what's the matter with you?

392
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,709
Do you know how serious the negative impact

393
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:32,260
of such a sudden withdrawal is on Huateng Land?

394
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,870
Who gave you the authority to make the decision?

395

What else can I do?

396
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,580
Should I proceed as planned

397
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,099
and let everyone knows that Huateng Land plagiarizes?

398
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,970
Okay. Stop arguing.

399
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,569
The most urgent matter now is to come up with a countermeasure.

We don't have any evidence now.

402
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,669
I think Director Song decided to suddenly withdraw

403
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,190
after considering that plagiarism will bring us more harm.

404

I don't get it.

412

Only both of us knew the password of the slide file. Why did it suddenly leak out?

413

I know it now.

414
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,470
You took our hard work and gave it to Liuxing as a welcome gift.

415
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,679
What nonsense are you talking about? Geiger Capital is Geiger Capital.

416

I've always been curious.

Why do you have an eye on Huateng Land?

You are using us as cannon fodder.

I will repeat it again. I did not leak it out.

If you all rely on willfulness and reasoning in your work,

Her suitor gave her a bottle of perfume. She talked about it all the way.

It's indeed a very popular perfume on the internet recently.

438

You mean it's vulgar?

Are you still mad at me about Secretary Chen's matter?

I fully support you mentally.

So, I could only stay in the middle.

Get out.

451

I'll drink a few glasses with you later.

452
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,119
I don't drink. I'll black out.

No, no.

The bad news...

469

At present, both of you are still in a co-tenant relationship built around finances.

Don't be impatient.

471

Although she didn't trust you today and made you mad, girls...

Put yourself in her shoes.

473

She battled with you. That means she hasn't given up yet.

Didn't you oppose me to interfere with her life since long ago?

477

If not for your selfless confession that day.

That's not what I mean.

503

I've messed up such a big project as Qinghu tender.

504
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,290
It's not your fault.

505
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,699
You just started in this field. Suffering losses is inevitable.

Treat it as a lesson.

507

Although you've lost a project, you've at least recognized an enemy.

508
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,309
Letting Su Zhinian remain at the company carries a bigger potential risk.

Do you think it's him too?

510

I've been having doubts about Su Zhinian's investment in Huateng.

511
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,289
First, from the investment perspective,

512
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,190
to be honest, Huateng Land is in a mess now.

When I interviewed Director Lin after the tender, he was really angry.

546

It sounded like it was hard to fix it.

Do you have a clue who the mastermind is?

548
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,689
We found that Geiger Capital and Liuxing have close cooperation.

549
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:06,889
It's probably Su Zhinian.

550

Su Zhinian?

551
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,719
Isn't he Huateng Land's shareholder? He won't benefit from doing this.

552
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,860
Yes. He didn't admit it.

553
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,009
Then, don't go back now.

554
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,159
If he really did it, then it'd be very dangerous.

555
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:28,019
Today, if Brother Yinan didn't send you home, do you still plan to go back?

556
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,200
You're too careless.

00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:42,970
But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

641
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:49,059
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

642
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:53,119
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

643
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,020
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

644
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:05,580
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
