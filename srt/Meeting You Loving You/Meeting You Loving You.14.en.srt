[Episode 14]

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm sorry. We are not sure who sent you back here last night.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,400
We didn't see Mr. Su whom you mentioned.

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Okay, thank you.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,300
- Where have you been?
- Where have you been?

24
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,000
It was something private.

25
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,900
Director Song, you woke up early.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,100
I'm not comparable to you, Director Yu. You're going out for inspection so early. Why didn't you bring me along?

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,800
Zhinian showed me around. Your project has great potential.

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,700
But there are many unsolved issues, so I'm not going to invest in it.

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,100
I still have things to do, Zhinian will send me back later. Do you want to come with us?

30
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,900
You may leave first. Both of us will stay for another day.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,700
As for the unsolved issues, I have solutions already.

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,500
Director Wu from Wancheng Supervision Department will be here later.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,800
We shouldn't drag Director Yu along with us.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
Right, Director Su?

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,900
Right? Did you forget?

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,500
I'll ask the driver to send you back to the city.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,900
A day or two won't make any difference.

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,500
I'll take a stroll on my own. You two go ahead.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look forward to your good news.

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
When did Director Wu say that he'd come?

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's what happened.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
That means the locals refused to cooperate with the reconstruction

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,500
because someone was pulling the strings. That's why you were pushed into the water.

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,300
Shouldn't your first reaction be about me falling into the water?

45
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,700
You're not worried at all because you knew about it already.

46
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,100
Or were you the one who saved me yesterday?

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,200
You're standing right here, safe and sound, why should I be worried?

48
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,600
What did you do last night? Why didn't you go home? Where did you go with Yu Wanting?

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,200
She wasn't feeling well last night, so I sent her to the hospital.

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Did you take care of her in the hospital for the whole night?

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,900
Is your brain affected by the incident?

52
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,400
I shall go to the hospital for a check-up.

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Wait. We're not done talking yet.

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Hello?

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Director Song. Mr. Zhao has agreed to talk to you. When are you free?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,900
Hello, Director. Don't worry, the manuscript for tomorrow is ready.

58
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,200
Okay.

[Ten Sins of Huateng Land]

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,500
What do you want to do?

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,600
What do I want to do? Didn't you see it?

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,100
Stop the nonsense. I've explained to you that she's just a younger sister to me.

63
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,400
Furthermore, aren't you best friends?

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Do you want to see Huateng Land and her to be in trouble?

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Best friends? Do you think that we can still be best friends after all that has happened?

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Looks like I can't work here anymore.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
I'll leave now.

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,900
Nuan Nuan.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Nuan Nuan. Stop throwing a tantrum. Come back with me.

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not making trouble. We always quarrel when we're together. I'm just a bit tired.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,800
- Nuan Nuan!
- My leg!

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,200
- Nuan Nuan!
- Is she okay?

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
How could this be okay? Call an ambulance now!

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,200
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

75
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Hello, is this 120?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,800
The unique charm of ecology in Qinghu does not only lie within its stunning landscape.

77
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Breaking stereotypes and establishing the unique,

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,800
green, and culturally rich brand of Qinghu is what makes our project special.

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
We'll keep the repairable authentic houses and the special local handicrafts.

80
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Examples of traditional handicrafts are wood carving, embroidery, and handmade shoes.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,900
This is to allow the local features to blend perfectly with the two-dimensional games.

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,000
These ideas are what I discussed with the planning team earlier.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Director Yu, what do you think?

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,400
Your idea is interesting. I'm surprised.

85
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,700
I'm not as capable as you.

86
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,700
This creative idea is impressive.

87
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,600
It not only solves the employment issue in this town,

88
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
but also retains the features of the local buildings.

89
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm going to the washroom.

90
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
Me too.

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,900
Honestly, the prospect of your project is great.

92
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,600
It's just that projects of this scale

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,200
will not really make any difference to my company.

94
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Director Yu, please tell me the prerequisites directly.

95
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
You're smart.

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,100
Between the project and Su Zhinian, you can only choose one of them.

97
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
What's wrong?

98
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Do you think that I, as an investor, shouldn't be so self-willed and mix up work and private matters?

99
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,500
Aren't you like that?

100
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
Of course, I'm not.

101
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,600
I worked hard for a long time to reach where I am today. Why can't I be self-willed?

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Furthermore, I came back this time just for Su Zhinian.

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Let me tell you.

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Su Zhinian isn't a part of your self-willed plans.

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Director Song.

106
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Don't regret it.

107
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,000
Same to you, Director Yu.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Let's go back to town together.

109
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Thanks for helping these two days. I'll return the favor to you later.

110
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,100
Later?

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,600
When do you plan to return the favor? My flight is tomorrow.

112
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
- Shall we meet tonight and—
- How about this?

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,800
We shall return twice the favor to Director Yu.

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,000
You're going to visit my father with me, remember?

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes.

116
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,000
I won't attend the alumni gathering tonight.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
A... Alumni gathering?

118
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
What else could it be?

119
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Director Yu, shall I arrange a car to take you directly to the alumni gathering? Is that all right?

120
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,000
It's fine. I'll go by myself.

121
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,900
I'll call you tonight.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll call you tonight.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,700
You look quite gentle like this. Keep it up.

124
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,600
Where are we going?

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,700
To visit your father. If we don't leave now, we'll be caught in the traffic.

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,900
Yi...

127
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
Why did you save me?

128
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,900
It's because I love you.

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Although I know you love Qingchun,

130
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I still love you.

131
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
I don't.

132
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,200
- I...
- I'm not stupid, Yinan.

133
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Whether you have feelings for someone can be sensed.

134
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,200
Before this, I felt resentful.

135
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,700
I thought that by treating you well,

136
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
you might change your feelings one day.

137
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,400
However, playing a monodrama for a long time is tiring.

138
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,100
Yinan.

139
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm willing to delete the manuscript.

140
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,100
I'd like to see you become a couple.

141
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I just want you to be happy.

142
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,400
You're so silly. Did I agree to break up with you?

143
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I promise that I won't quarrel with you because of other people anymore.

145
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,300
It was all my fault. Can you give me one more chance?

146
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
Hello.

147
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll be there tomorrow. I've prepared everything.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Okay, see you at the airport.

149
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Director Song, didn't you take too long?

150
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Director Su, you were also busy, weren't you?

151
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,200
Did something happen?

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Unless you tell me, where you went with Yu Wanting last night.

153
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,900
I'll count to three. We'll say it together.

154
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,400
Okay.

155
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,500
One, two, three.

156
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
You cheated.

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,300
Aren't you the same?

158
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,200
We'll count again. You must say it this time.

159
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,300
One, two, three.

160
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,900
- Guess.
- Hospital.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
I can't guess.

162
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,300
I didn't think you could. Do you really think you can read my mind?

163
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,700
It's a shame that I can never read your mind.

164

Director Song.

166
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,300
Here's an update about the photo you told me to find.

167
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,800
I restored some of the surveillance footage. Look.

168
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,200
Obviously, someone was spiking the drink.

169
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,400
It's all your fault for making me look silly in the photo.

170
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,700
I'll take it if you don't like it.

171
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,300
There's no mole on Su Zhinian's arm.

172

Where is Director Su?

173
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,300
Director Su? Director Su hasn't come to the office today.

174
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,800
Director Song.

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
I'll leave the project to you.

176
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,800
You've already said it three times.

177
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
However, I want to take back my words.

178
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,900
No matter if it's the future of the project or the person, it's unpredictable.

179
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,600
Or I should say you have the ability to turn bad into good.

180
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,000
She really has great potential but I never see her as an investment.

181
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,200
You really changed a lot.

182
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,100
You're more lively.

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
What should I do? It seems I'm...

184
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,700
Just kidding.

185
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,600
I'm a smart person.

186
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I won't waste time on something without a result.

187
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,400
I wish you a safe trip.

188
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,200
Director Yu, have a safe journey.

189
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
Don't forget our promise.

190
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,300
Su Zhinian isn't a part of your self-willed plans.

191
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,000
Director Song, you really can't allow others to take any advantage.

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Can't we even shake hands?

193
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,200
What should I do?

194
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
I planned to go back immediately to report

195
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,100
Qinghu's project to my boss so that we can

196
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,400
proceed with the first funding.

197
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,000
Why did you change your mind suddenly?

198
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Perhaps it's not too embarrassing to be defeated by you.

199
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,000
As for where I went with Su Zhinian that night...

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,700

201

I'm leaving. Bye.

202
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,800
Where did both of you go that night?

203
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Why did you come?

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,800
I'm asking you. Answer me.

205
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,500
Why did you come to see me in such a hurry?

206
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
About what happened four years ago,

207
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,000
I want to apologize to you.

208
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,000
What are you looking at so seriously?

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Director Qin.

210
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Nothing. Director Song told me to check something for her.

211
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,800
- Where's Qingchun? Has she left work?
- No.

212
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,400
She watched the video, I mean, she read the information

213
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,700
that I sent her and hurried out to meet Director Su.

214
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,300
Director Qin. Do you have something urgent to talk to her about?

215
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,800
It's okay. I have the amended contract with Yangguang Capital.

216
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,700
Tell Qingchun to read it as soon as possible.

217
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay.

218
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,600
About the photo, everything is clear now.

219
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,000
Including the news that the netizens found, Li Damin was the one behind everything.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,300
Zheng Hao referred to a photo leaked by the netizens.

221
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Zheng Hao referred to a photo leaked by the netizens and found this video.

222
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,300
That's how I know I didn't just get drunk at the bar that night

223
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
I was drugged.

224
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,400
All these years I've misunderstood you.

225
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,700
I even chased you away from the house.

226
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,000
With just the mole on the arm, it's hard to identify who this is.

227
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,900
What else do you remember about that night at the bar?

228
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,800
That day was my birthday.

229
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
No one was at home.

230
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,200
So, when I knew that Brother Yinan, I mean Qin Yinan,

231
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,000
would follow the uncles in the company to meet the clients at the bar, I went there to meet him.

232
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,300
I planned to go home with him...

233
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
To celebrate my birthday.

234
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
But I didn't see him that night. No.

235
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
- Didn't you see him?
- No.

236
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,600
You created a romantic night for two.

237
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
You even let the maid have a day off.

238
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
I thought you were doing an exchange program overseas,

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,500
so you couldn't come back.

240
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,600
I didn't expect that you not only came back but also drank a lot.

Confess to Brother Yinan.

Can't you remember anything about that night?

245
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,400
Did you see who sent me back?

246
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,900
That night, I heard the sound of the door closing, so I went to your room to meet you.

247
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,700
I couldn't remember anything else until I woke up the next morning.

248
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Now I remember.

249
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
That night, I saw Li Damin at the bar.

250
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,700
I also got a glass of drink which was for my birthday.

251
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,400
I think he was the one who gave it to me.

252
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,800
Did he give it to you himself?

253
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
No. It was a waiter.

254
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let down my guard.

255
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,500
That day, Qin Yinan should be there with Li Damin to meet the client.

256
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,400
Did he discover anything?

257
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
Or did you see him at the bar?

258
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
No.

259
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,200
He said that when he wanted to meet me, I wasn't there anymore.

I'm fine.

Oh, yeah. What time did you come back last night?

Did you see me when you left?

When I came out, you weren't there anymore.

266
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000

What about Su Zhinian? Didn't he come back as well?

271

He left. He won't stay with us anymore.

272
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,900
At that time, I thought you did this. So, I didn't ask further for other details.

273
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,000
Shall I ask again?

274

Are you free tomorrow morning? I have something important to tell you.

Is the tenancy contract expiring?

Okay.

My boyfriend is overseas. He'll come back soon.

What kind of landlord is he?

288
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,100
He flirts with his tenant. He has no moral baseline at all.

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,279
So, I'll have to hand over this gift in person now.

320
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,419
You wanted to see me in such a hurry. Did something happen?

321
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,209
Do you remember that I went to meet you at the bar on my 20th birthday?

322
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:52,090
Of course. That day, I went to meet a client with the uncles.

323
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,240
I got your message. You said you would wait for me at the entrance and go home together with me.

324
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,660
When I came out, you were gone already.

325
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,580
When did Li Damin leave?

326
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,310
Did you both leave at the same time?

327
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,660
No.

328
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,899
He received a call and left first because he had something to do.

329
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,450
What's wrong?

330
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,170
Did Li Damin do something again?

331
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,890
Actually, on that night, I...

332
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,759
What day is today? What a coincidence.

333
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,420
Indeed. What a coincidence.

334
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,070
Yes.

335
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,879
It seems you're quite relaxed during your suspension period.

336
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:38,420
I have nothing to do every day. I must learn how to utilize time.

337
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,010
Director Song. I was about to ask you this.

338
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,899
How is the investigation going?

339
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,070
When can I resume work?

340
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,609
Regarding this, the board of directors will make their decision.

341
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,949
Qinghu's project is going to start soon but I'm just staying at home all the time.

342
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,729
All right. Let's not talk about this.

343
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,380
How is your father now?

344
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,000
He's still the same.

345
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,830
What... What's wrong with you?

346
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,139
- So clumsy!
- I'm sorry.

347
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:26,280
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

348
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,310
Are you only going to apologize?

349
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,099
I'm really so sorry.

350
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,580
Look at the mess you made! I want to see your manager!

351
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,759
I'm really sorry for what happened.

352
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,489
Vice-President Li. Stop acting.

353
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:37,550
I'll give you another cup.

354
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,200
You're the man in the video, aren't you?

355
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,370
What do you mean?

356
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,000
Are you suspecting me?

357
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,619
What can a short video tell?

358
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,110
There are many people who have a mole on their arms.

359
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,110
- You are funny.
- However, you ordered the drink for me.

360
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,930
Only you would know that I was in the bar

361
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,800
and would drink it.

362
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,140
You're right.

363
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,260
It was me, so what?

364
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,459
Your father has been oppressing me in Huateng all these years.

365
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:28,459
I can't fight with him but I know that you're his weakness.

366
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:32,410
Originally, I wanted to take some photos as a bargaining chip,

367
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,279
but when he appeared, all my plans were ruined!

368
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,760
Jerk!

369
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,130
Brother Yinan, stop it.

370
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,670
Let the police handle a jerk like him.

371
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,980
I didn't expect that Li Damin was the one behind it.

372
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,630
Yeah. Thankfully, we've eliminated this toxic person.

373
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,139
I want to go back first.

374
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,810
- Where are you going? The office?

375
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,169
Director Qin and I need to go back to the office to do something.

376
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:04,140
You can have the car.

377
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,790
Can I have a ride with you?

378
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,480
Sure.

379
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,279
All right. I'll leave now.

380
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,839
Boss. Your archery skills have improved.

381
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,769
Using that useless Li Damin in exchange for Qin Yinan is a worthy transaction.

382
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,960
As for Li Damin...

383
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,940
Follow the original plan. Transfer the agreed amount to his bank account.

384
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,999
This old man is smart.

385
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:19,710
He knows that I have the goods on him, so he ingratiated himself with me.

386
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,439
How can you be sure that Qin Yinan will approach us?

387
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:29,259
Now that Li Damin has taken the blame for him, there's no reason for him to work with us anymore.

388
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,650
It's because he can't afford to lose.

389
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,320
Qin Yinan. Enough of your drama.

390
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,030
It's time to end it.

391
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

392
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,480
I know that you and Li Damin colluded.

393
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,500
The person who spiked Qingchun's drink was you.

394
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,040
Right?

395
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,130
Yes.

396
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,200
It was me.

397
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,979
Brother Yinan. When can you wrap up?

398
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:14,379
No one is at home.

399
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,170
I'll go to the bar and wait for you to go home together.

400
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,820
Okay.

401
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,380
- Yi Nan.
- Uncle Li.

402
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,240
You're early.

403
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,659
Come. Hang my coat.

404
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,039
Thank you.

405
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,900
You're welcome.

406
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,960
Have a seat.

407
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,100
Well.

408
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,699
Later, when Director Zheng and others arrive, don't embarrass me.

409
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:43,980
Uncle Li, thank you for giving me the chance to meet such an important client.

410
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,550
Why are you thanking me?

411
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,340
I'm just the vice president of the company.

412
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,960
Chairman Song has the final say.

413
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,100
Chairman Song lets Su Zhinian

414
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,519
have his internship in the company by working as his assistant.

415
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,619
Do you know what it means to be the president's assistant?

416
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,179
Connections, resources,

417
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,710
and even the future of Huateng Land.

418
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,199
It's obvious that Chairman Song is treating Su Zhinian

419
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:23,280
like his son-in-law.

420
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,519
Oh, right. I bumped into Qingchun just now.

421
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,070
She said she would wait for you to go back and celebrate her birthday.

422
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,440
You may go later. Keep her company.

423
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,259
Remember. If you want to capture a girl's heart,

424
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:45,960
the timing and method are important.

425
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,770
Okay. Later, make a toast to her

426
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,240
and wish her a happy birthday on my behalf.

427
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,369
Sir. This is your drink.

428
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,929
Take this drink to the lady sitting at K20 and wish her a happy birthday.

429
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,580
Okay.

430
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,100
Miss.

431
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,130
Qingchun.

432
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,480
Qingchun.

433
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Brother Yinan. I'll go home first.

434
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,840
- Come.
- Leave me alone.

435
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,270
Who are you?

436
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,040
I have to wait for Brother Yinan.

437
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,280
Qingchun.

438
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,040
I'll be responsible to you.

439
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,720
So what?

440
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,890
It was also me who lured you to Song Qingchun's bedroom

441
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,409
but you don't have any evidence.

442
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,759
Leave Jiangli. Leave Song Qingchun alone.

443
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,299
Are you able to make Li Damin take back his words or are you going to tell Qingchun?

444
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,239
I bet you won't do anything.

445
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,339
So, what makes you think that I'll resign and leave Jiangli?

446
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,990
Let me tell you now.

447
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,660
Su Zhinian, are you crazy?

448
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,480
I promise!

449
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,530
You're afraid of dying.

450
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,229
You're afraid of losing the perfect image that you show to the public.

451
00:34:33,229 --> 00:34:35,829
You're afraid of losing everything you have now.

452
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:37,870
So, you don't have a choice.

453
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,669
I'll give you a month.

454
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:43,939
For the sake of Qingchun, this is all that I'm willing to put up with.

455
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,170
Vice-President Li, what brought you here?

456
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,440
I'm just a vice president who is under suspension. Nothing really troubles me.

457
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,490
You might be the one being troubled.

458
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,370
What do you mean?

459
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,970
Are you free tomorrow morning? I have something important to tell you.

460
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,020
I'm here to help you.

461
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,120
What do you want me to do?

462
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,720
You don't have to do anything.

463
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,690
Someone has paid the bargaining chip on your behalf.

464
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,320
Who?

465
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,600
[Chen Han]

466
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,219
Boss. He's here.

467
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,020
Director Qin.

468
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,959
I've heard a lot about you.

469
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,900
Director Chen, you helped me a lot.

470
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,210
I must come and thank you in person.

471
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,980
But I'm a little confused.

472
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,439
We don't know each other. Why did you help me?

473
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:03,310
Come and have a seat.

474
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,710
Sit down, please.

475
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,930
Director Qin, to be honest,

476
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,960
I admire you very much.

477
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,370
Of course, a more important reason is that we have a common enemy.

478
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,869
Hence, I've been looking forward to working with you.

479
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:30,369
Director Chen, you know my past very well but I know nothing about you.

480
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,469
This doesn't seem to be a good start for our cooperation.

481
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:39,440
However, our goals are the same, which is to crush Su Zhinian.

482
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,110
That's the most important thing, right?

483
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,280
Su Zhinian has the support from Geiger Capital.

484
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,450
Now, he rides a wave of Qingchun in Huateng.

485
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,780
It's not easy to fight against him.

486
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,460
Then, we shall use his advantage against him.

487
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,710
I'm sure that he has a weak point.

488
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,560
What do you mean?

489
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,370
Miss Song.

490
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,309
Director Chen, I forgot to tell you that the precondition of our cooperation

491
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,930
is that we mustn't hurt Qingchun.

492
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,640
You've misunderstood. I didn't mean that.

493
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,110
What I mean is...

494
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,929
You want to make use of her to chase Su Zhinian away from Huateng

495
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:27,140
and ruin his reputation.

496
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,009
It seems like I've made the right move to sacrifice Li Damin for you.

497
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,260
Qingchun.

498
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,590
Qingchun.

499
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,670
[Does Song Qingchun know what you did that night?]

500
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:12,139
You don't know how dangerous it was at that time. He didn't hesitate at all and leaped to protect me.

501
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,220
[Civilisation of Law: Civil Law System]

502
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,380
I'm the one who knows you best.

503
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,540
Why do you only look at Song Qingchun all the time?

504
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,049
Yinan. You're back.

505
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,459
- Have you eaten?
- Yes. What about you?

506
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,669
I haven't. Do you want to eat some with me?

507
00:39:45,669 --> 00:39:47,140
Okay.

508
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,560
You look happy today.

509
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,030
I met a good business partner.

510
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,270
An iced americano, please.

511
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,710
Sure.

512
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,640
Oh no. Why is he here?

513
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,430
If he knew that I was here to meet the landlord, wouldn't the secret be exposed?

514
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,560
My present...

515
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,650
Cheng Qingcong?

516
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,040
Sir!

517
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,260
I'm sorry.

518
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,940
Haven't you apologized already?

519
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,520
Moreover, I should be the one apologizing.

520
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,720
No matter the reason,

521
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,440
I still...

522
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,320
Being drunk is not an excuse.

523
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,140
What did you do to me?

524
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,929
Let me ask you.

525
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,340
Apart from me, have you drunk alcohol with other people?

526
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,620
- No.
- Really?

527
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,520
Haven't you drunk with Director Yu?

528
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,639
On your birthday, that was the first and only time I drank alcohol.

529
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,909
Actually, I have a low alcohol tolerance which is about two to three glasses.

530
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,519
Ever since then, I swore that I'd never drink anymore.

531
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,810
Give me a moment.

532
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,170
