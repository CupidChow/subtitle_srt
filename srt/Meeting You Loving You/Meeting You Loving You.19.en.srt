166
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,000
Isn't this my only choice?

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,800
- Then...
- About Song Qingchun, I'll break up with her.

168
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
If she wants compensation, I'll do my best to fulfill it.

169
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,000
Regardless of our relationship in the past,

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,200
as of now, I don't remember her, nor do I like her.

171
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,800
Since I've decided to erase her from my memories,

172
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,900
it must be the right decision and the best for us.

173
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,200
I'll inform the research institute to prepare for the surgery as soon as possible.

174
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,000
But before that, can you keep this a secret first?

175
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
I didn't know you like to be controlled by your girlfriend.

176
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
I'll get going now.

177
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,500
Wait.

178
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
Song Qingchun has been living with you.

179
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sure she's waiting for you at home.

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
You should watch what you're saying.

181
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't go too far.

182
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
After all, she'll suffer the most when this happens.

183
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Do you know what stage is our relationship in?

184
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,200
Couples.

185
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
I meant the stage between a couple.

186
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,700
How would I know about this?

187
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,000
Didn't you say you've been objecting to our relationship and keeping an eye on us?

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,500
It's monitoring, not keeping an eye on you.

189
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,600
Why? Are you afraid that you've done something bad that would make it hard for you to break up with her?

190
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
You're overthinking it.

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,300
I'm only thinking about how I should compensate her.

192
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,000
Make sure to watch what you say when you go back.

193
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,500
You're back.

194
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,700
Miss Song, I have something to tell you.

195
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,100
Okay. But can you give me five minutes first?

196
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,300
There's no point wasting that five minutes. It won't change anything.

197
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,600
If you have such spare time, why don't you think of the terms for compensation?

198
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,800
I don't need it.

199
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,100
There's always room for negotiation except when the terms aren't satisfactory.

200
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,600
You can't trade feelings.

201
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Can I put it this way?

202
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,000
You're refusing to talk to me because you're afraid you'll change your mind after five minutes.

203
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
Okay. Five minutes.

204
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,700
It was dusk on July 1st of the year 2014.

205
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,600
The weather was sunny and refreshing.

206
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,500
We met at school when cherry blossoms were in full bloom.

207
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,300
The cherry blossom season is from late January to mid-April.

208
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,000
A false description will only reduce the trust of the negotiator.

209

In any case, you fell in love with me at first sight on the day.

210
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,900
When you met me again, you were smitten with love for me.

211
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,900
You even set the password to your phone, bank cards, and the front entrance

212
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,400
to the date we met.

My dad hired you to be my tutor, and you stayed at my house.

216
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,800
That's when we first started staying together.

217
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,300
It was also the beginning of your seven-year crush.

218

[You learned to play piano in secret]
you spent a week learning to play piano and recorded a tape.

220

When Kobe retired, you knew how much I wanted Kobe's signed jersey.

221
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,100
So you joined the Best Dunker's competition

222

223
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,000
and got the jersey as a reward.

Your slides are good.

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,700
But I won't change my mind.

228
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
You taught me how to make the slides.

229
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,700
The second day I moved into your house,

230
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I tried to learn how to cook and almost burned down your kitchen.

231
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,300
You arranged all sorts of house chores for me.

232
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,300
You even showed it to me in the form of slides.

233
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,400
You told me the realization of one's creativity starts with good slides.

234
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
That's enough, Miss Song.

235
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,500
I get what you're trying to do. But you don't have to do this.

236
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,400
I can't deny our past. But it's already in the past.

I'm no longer the "Su Zhinian" you mentioned.

So I hope you can understand.

Your memory loss is only temporary.

There's no need for me to remember.

243
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,600
You can demand your terms for the compensation.

244

Consider it my apology.

245

Of course, if you like this house,

246

I can transfer it under your name.

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
Do you know how that feels?

325
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,400
I... I still can't tell

326
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,800
if last night was a dream or I'm dreaming now.

327
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,200
I even thought

328
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
why I was not the one who had lost my memory?

329
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
But I don't want to give up.

330
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,700
I can't accept the fact that he has forgotten about me.

331
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,600
Just do what you told Director Su.

332
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Find ways to make him remember you.

333
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,200
He loved you so much.

334
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
He'll remember you.

335
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,400
You still have me too.

336
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
You're right.

337
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
I know what to do now.

338
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,600
- Tsk, tsk.
- That's not right.

339
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
- Isn't this...
- Cut.

340
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,500
I already said it's an exclamation.

341
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,400
Okay, got it.

342
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
Ask if there's anything else that you don't understand.

343
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,200
Director, I have a small request.

344
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,500
You see, I play as a leader of the punks.

345
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
Don't you think I have too few lines?

346
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,400
Can you add more lines for me?

347
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,800
As for the payment, it's negotiable.

348
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
No way.

349
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I don't want to make any changes to the script.

350
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,600
Listen, even if a good actor has no lines,

351
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,800
he can still make the audience feel

352
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,400
what he wants to express from his heart, you know?

353
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Okay.

354
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,100
Cong Cong, he's almost here.

355
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Everyone, get into your character.

356
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,600
We'll do what we did during rehearsal.

357
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,200
Remember to give me the signal.

358
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,400
But let me make myself clear.

359
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,800
You must not hurt him, understand?

360
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Don't worry.

361
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Director Cheng has made the arrangements.

362
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,400
We're all professionals here.

363
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,300
There won't be any problem.

364
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Cheng Qingcong, where are you?

365
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Director Su, you can just walk straight ahead.

366
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,000
Three. Two. One. Action!

367
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,400
- Let's go.
- Go! Go! Go!

368
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,300
Go ahead.

369
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,300
Director Song, it's about time for you to go in.

370
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,400
Is it my turn now?

371
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,600
- That was fast.
- You can do it. Go.

372
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't know you.

373
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
That's some attitude there.

374
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
You don't know us?

375
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,200
Let us help you recall it, then.

376
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
What's with the ad-lib?

377
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,700
Stop!

378
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,800
What are you doing?

379
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
Do you know this is school violence?

380
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
I've called the security office.

381
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,500
Guess how soon they'll get here?

382
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,800
That's not what's written in the script.

383
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,620
Are you okay?

384
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
Are you done messing around?

385
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm sorry. I was just...

386
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,200
Su Zhinian.

387
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,100
Miss Song, I'm sorry.

388
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,200
Did I release the confetti too soon?

389
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Forget about that confetti.

390
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,300
If I knew this would happen, I'd ask for more money.

391
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,600
- That's right.
- He even kicked me.

392
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Pay us more money.

393
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
It's different from the original plan.

394
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,500
Yeah, my stomach hurt.

395
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,600
You have to pay us more.

396
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,300
Pay us more.

397
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,700
Director Song!

398
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,000
Okay.

399
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,600
Director Su! Director Su!

400
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,000
- It's Director Song.
- Help!

401
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Director Song fell into the water.

402
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
She's calling for help, Director Su.

403
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,700
Help!

404
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
The water isn't that deep.

405
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,500
She won't drown.

406
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
Help!

407
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,800
For our deal this time, you'll have to put in more effort, Director Su.

408
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,800
But we're most confident of your foresight when it comes to investment.

409
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Director Wang, you're too modest.

410
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,900
I must say your strategy before was beautiful.

411
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,600
I remember the net value

412
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,800
of Hengfang Oil when you bought it on April 28th was 0.3305 yuan.

413
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,000
On the next day, when the stock market closed,

414
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,600
Hengfang Oil's secondary market price

415
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
had reached 0.656 yuan.

416
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,100
That's a 98.5% increase from its original price.

417
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,200
I didn't know you're so good with numbers.

418
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Don't just sit there.

419
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Pour Director Su a drink.

420
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Come. Come over here.

421
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Drink with Director Su.

422
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,600
- Serve Director Su well.
- Director Su.

423
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
I've already found out where he is.

424
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
It's right ahead. The largest private room.

425
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,800
You must let Director Su see how mature and generous you are this time.

426
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,100
So relax.

427
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,500
Come on.

428
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
You can do it.

429
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,500
I'm sorry. I don't drink alcohol.

430
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,700
Director Song.

431
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
How did it go?

432
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
What happened?

433
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,800
Tell me. How did it go?

434
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,800
He's having a great time.

435
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,700
Tell the Engineering Department to fix this room's air-conditioning system.

436
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,400
Yes, sir.

437
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
Are you the manager here?

438
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,200
Can you send some liquor to the largest private room ahead?

439
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
How many bottles do you want?

440
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,600
I want to send as many as the number of servers you have here.

441
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,900
One bottle for each person.

442
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,800
Tell them it's a surprise from me to Director Su.

443
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,400
All right. May I know what your surname is?

444
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
It's Song.

445
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
Other than that, prepare another room for me.

446
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,100
Sure, I'll make the arrangement now.

447
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,800
Please come this way.

448
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Come.

449
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,400
I want to vent my anger.

450
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,200
Otherwise, I'm going to explode.

451
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Come on. Drink up.

452
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
Cheers.

453
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
Quickly. Come in. Quickly now.

454
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,800
Did you order these?

455
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,000
No.

456
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,400
Did you get the wrong room?

457
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Excuse me for intruding.

458
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,700
A lady instructed us to deliver these to you.

459
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,200
She said it was a surprise for Director Su.

460
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,500
Which lady?

461
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
She said her last name was Song.

462
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,600
Director Su, you weren't honest just now.

463
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,800
You said you don't know how to drink and can't drink.

464
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,400
Now look at this, you're pretty good at faking it.

465
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,200
- That's right.
- Are you a regular here?

466
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,600
♪ Can I see you? ♪

467
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,800
♪ I guess an adventure ♪

468
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,200
♪ Is the happiest failure ♪

469
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,400
♪ I want to meet you among the crowds ♪

470
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,200
♪ Seeing your brilliance while flying low ♪

471
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,000
Listen, you can't spoil those men.

472
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,800
Yeah, you're right.

473
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,200
The more you go after him, the more he'll ignore you.

474
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
You have a point.

475
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,800
If one day I wave goodbye to let go and find someone who's richer,

476
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,000
more handsome, and younger than him, I shall see what's he going to do about it.

477
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
You have my support!

478
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,800
Director Song, are you giving up on Director Su?

479
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,400
How can I give up on him?

480
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,729
Other than his looks, Su Zhinian isn't that great at all.

481
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,039
If only you could see it just now.

482
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,729
In the private room, he didn't let any women touch him at all.

483
00:34:06,729 --> 00:34:09,910
I think he has a problem in bed.

484
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,760
Listen, Su Zhinian is nothing.

485
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,749
I don't know how he flattered those rich ladies

486
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,880
to get to where he is today.

487
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,719
But I don't think he only flattered those rich ladies.

488
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,980
Maybe he did something more outrageous.

489
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,570
Miss!

490
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,990
What's wrong with you?

491
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,589
Done with your foul mouth?

492
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:38,549
- Do you want me to rinse it for you?
- Who are you?

493
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,680
Director Su.

494
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,640
I don't care if you believe me or not.

495
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,530
I didn't arrange it this time.

496
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,530
How silly.

497
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,709
Director Song was really hurt because of Director Su today.

498
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:26,409
But she still doesn't give up. So no matter what,

499
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:28,839
we must find ways to bring them back together.

500
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:31,680
You'll help out, right?

501
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,200
Of course.

502
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,320
What's wrong with Director Su?

503
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,530
It's too dramatic that he suddenly lost his memories.

504
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,509
- Hello?
- Hello?

505
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:51,880
Is this Dr. Yan?

506
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,879
- Yes.
- Good evening.

507
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:57,209
Mr. Su's operation has been arranged according to what you said.

508
00:36:57,209 --> 00:37:00,250
If all goes to plan, it'll be carried out next Sunday.

509
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,599
Okay, bye.

510
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,459
What's wrong?

511
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,940
What operation?

512
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,509
Nothing, it was a telemarketer.

513
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,959
It's getting late, I'll send you home.

514
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,960
Which telemarketer speaks such fluent English?

515
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,439
You better be honest with me.

516
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,269
Are you hiding something from me?

517
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:23,819
Is this related to Director Su's memory loss?

518
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,209
It's really nothing.

519
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,090
Are you not telling me?

520
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,820
Fine, I'll ask Director Song.

521
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,819
Fine, I'll tell you.

522
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,610
But you must promise not to tell Song Qingchun.

523
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,609
Legend Su's memory loss is because of some issues in his brain.

524
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:44,559
He only has three months to live if he doesn't do the operation.

525
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,229
Stop joking around.

526
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,229
Director Su looks healthy.

527
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:49,629
It's impossible.

528
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:51,740
I hope it's a joke too.

529
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,460
But it's not.

530
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,240
So the reason we're not telling Director Song is...

531
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,890
The success rate of the operation is low.

532
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,099
If she knows about this, she'll be worried and anxious.

533
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:09,940
If the operation fails,

534
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,649
she'll be even sadder.

535
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,570
So we should use this chance

536
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,470
to let them break up for good.

537
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,360
But you just said to bring them back together.

538
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,649
Yan Yuan, you lied to me.

539
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,089
I wasn't.

540
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:26,300
- I was being objective.
- You're lying.

541
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,500
If I didn't overhear the conversation, you'd keep it from me.

542
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,569
When Director Su is undergoing operation overseas,

543
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,040
Director Song would still be kept in the dark.

544
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,809
No matter what, don't tell Song Qingchun about this.

545
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:41,230
This is Legend Su's decision before his memory loss.

547
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,900
[Renji Hospital]

548
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,240
When I knew he had a superpower

549
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,470
I once thought he was the chosen one.

550
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,587
This only exists in movies.

551
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:03,320
He was so cool.

552
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,768
But the truth is,

553
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:10,130
he suffered more from it.

554
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,080
Ordinary people like us can't even imagine.

555
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,560
After he uses his superpower,

556
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,650
he would suffer from its side effects.

557
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,280
His cerebral nervous system suffers

558
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,380
serious damage because of it.

559
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,630
How serious?

560
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,810
He'll die,

561
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,260
right?

562
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,770
It was the day he confessed his feelings to you.

563
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,519
At Jiangli No.1 Junior High School, he left momentarily.

564
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,960
It was also the same time I had received his test report.

565
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,900
The result is bad.

566
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,540
No wonder he said so many weird things that day.

567
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,530
He wasn't only confessing to me.

568
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,970
He's also saying goodbye to me.

569
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,339
So he already decided not to do the operation, right?

570
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,310
So all the good things we experienced that day are

571
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,990
the memories he left for himself.

572
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,570
As for me,

573
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,899
he would erase everything related to him from my memories.

574
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,650
How did you know?

575
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,200
It wasn't the first time he did that to me.

576
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,559
Based on his condition, he shouldn't have used his superpower anymore.

577
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,820
Doing that will only make his condition worse.

578
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,209
It's no different from committing suicide.

579
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,550
But he still did it because he cares about you.

580
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,140
Is there still time for the operation?

581
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,780
Does he still have hope?

582
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,280
We have a 20% of success rate.

583
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,230
Have you arranged for the operation?

584
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,430
He'll depart this weekend at the latest.

585
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,010
I want to see him one more time.
