The rice has been washed.

164
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,059
You just need to pour a bottle and a half of mineral water

into the rice cooker and press the congee button.

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,399
Hi. The person you're looking for is seated right by the window.

323
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:17,019
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

324
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,949
Hi. I'm the reporter introduced by Mr. Ma.

325
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,930
The rights consultant?

326
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,879
Reporter Tang?

327
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,359
Who ordered a takeout?

328
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Me.

329
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,729
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

330
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,359
It's been a while.

331
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,560
It's been a while.

332
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,199
We all know that you and your husband

333
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,309
have gone through a lot of ups and downs together.

334
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,749
Could you share your story with him?

335
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,589
How we were brought together was somewhat of a miracle.

336
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:13,560
If nothing unexpected happens,

337
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,600
in the process of growing up,

338
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,990
we might get acquainted,

339
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,390
fall in love with each other,

340
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,330
and even get married.

341
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,670
But life isn't always smooth sailing.

342
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,470
It's been five years.

343
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,509
But I really do need your help with something.

344
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,950
Do tell.

345
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,130
If my surgery...

346
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,360
Perhaps, I'm a little selfish.

347
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,320
What I fear most is not death,

348
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,330
but lying in bed, not able to do anything or give her a glimmer of hope.

349
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,950
So, whatever the result is,

350
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,200
if I'm not fully recovered,

351
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,230
please tell her that I'm gone.

352
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,470
Okay.

353
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,990
Whether our relationship starts from zero or negative,

354
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,899
it brings our hearts even closer together.

355
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,290
Somehow, in such a big wide world, we can always find each other.

356
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,010
That's because I believe

357
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,120
that someday,

358
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,410
he'll come back to me again.

359
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,769
Hey, guys! We meet again.

360
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,909
Hurry. Mr. Su, say hi to everyone.

361
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:31,539
Hello, everyone! I'm Mrs. Su's husband.

362
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm Su Zhinian.

363
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,350
That's right.

364
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,469
It's only been two days since Mr. Su and I got married.

365
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,300
But still, there are no flowers.

366
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,549
No date.

367
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,030
No candlelight dinner.

368
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,930
Mr. Su is a penny-pincher, don't you think?

369
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,749
Look. I made some remarks about him, and he's upset already.

370
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:47,970
How would I possibly upset Mrs. Su?

371
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,760
Right? Good that you know.

372
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,569
- It hurts.
- So annoying.

373
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,180
What are we having for dinner?

374
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,410
This is your favorite flower, isn't it?

375
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,749
My favorite?

376
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,870
Are you going to give it to me as a flower?

377
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,400
No. I'll teach you how to choose them.

378
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,300
Okay.

379
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,599
Here. What are we having?

380
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,029
It's Mr. Su's lecture time.

381
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,449
Look. Look at the broccoli that I have.

382
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:12,919
First, avoid the yellowish ones because they are past the peak freshness.

383
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,849
Second, when we choose broccoli, take note of its flower balls and buds.

384
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:22,360
In general, fresh broccoli comes with tight heads, not a loose bunch.

385
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,409
It's best if it's like my hair. That's right.

386
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,990
Also, take note of the surface of the flower balls.

387
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,759
It's not uneven, and it gives a compact and bulgy feeling.

388
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,800
The buds of the head of a good broccoli
are firm and tight.

389
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,409
Mrs. Su. Are you even listening?

390
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:37,500
I'm asking you if you were listening.

391
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,390
I am. Really, I am.

392
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,729
- Well, what else do you want to eat?
- It was a long explanation.

393
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:41,740
I'll buy them for you.

394
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,180
You can have them all in one go and make you turn chubby like a pig.

395
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,020
I don't want to turn into a pig.

396
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,260
What are you making for dinner?

397
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,499
I'll make you anything you want. So what else do you want?

398
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,640
I want pear with rock sugar soup.

399
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,239
Okay. Let's go. We'll get some pears.

400
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,929
Then, we'll buy Mrs. Su's favorite preserved plum, all right?

401
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,949
Okay! Did you see that?

402
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,460
Mr. Su is finally catching on.

403
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,229
Finally, he's going to cook for me.

404
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,400
Not only I'm catching on, I'm becoming obsessed too.

405
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,290
- So obsessed with Mrs. Su that I'm hooked on her.
- What a sweet-talker.

406
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,890
We're going to get some pears now.

407
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,509
- Okay.
- Bye.

408
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,790
Mr. Su, you know what?

409
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,330
I'm in a bad mood today.

410
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,839
What's your decision on that matter?

411
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,689
About that proposal. I'll think about it.

412
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,510
Thank you for your sponsorship for this awards ceremony.

413
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,090
Here. Cheers.

414

Nice working with you.

415
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,959
I won't keep you any longer.

Director Sun.

420
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,899
Qingchun. Look, in the past,

421
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,809
I used to think like a bureaucrat and didn't appreciate the talents.

422
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:49,769
But you moved past all that and even came back to support my cause.

423
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:51,130
I'm really touched.

424
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,539
Look. You did well in the last few years.

425
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,850
In just a few years, you've already become the pillar of our station.

426
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,699
Mr. Sun, I'm really flattered.

427
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,710
The ceremony is about to begin. Let's go inside.

428
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,799
Oh, right. I need your help with something.

429
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,069
Do tell.

430
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,839
Didn't you make a show about traditional folk craftsmen some time ago?

431
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,199
I happen to have a necklace here.

432
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,969
I hope you can wear it when you go on the stage to debut it.

433
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,610
About that...

434
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,010
Don't get the wrong idea.

435
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,220
This time, it isn't sponsored by the sponsor.

436
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,170
A fan of yours asked me to give it to you.

437
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,739
This necklace has a special meaning behind it.

438
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:25,789
Let's hope that when you put it on, his loved one

439
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,720
will feel his love through you.

440
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,209
- Also, this necklace—
- Mr. Sun.

441
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:33,600
Don't worry. I'll wear it.

442
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,609
Qingchun. You're much more mature now.

443
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,870
Qingchun. Qingchun! Where are you going?

444
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,679
- I'm sorry.
- Miss Song, are you all right?

I'm sorry.

May there be someone to ask you if the congee is warm enough.

With three meals a day, and someone to share the home with.
