Everyone agrees to you be the general manager of the company.

We all respect him.

36

But managing a company is not

37
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,169

38

Or do you have a prejudice against me?

42
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,670
Don't say that.

43
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,490
I've been watching you grow up.

44

But we can't be careless with the company.

49
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,170
Yes, we can't be careless.

50
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,780
Right.

I'll be serious about my dad's hard work.

53

Otherwise, I wouldn't make a promise in public on the day of the press conference.

How can we solve the current problem?

61
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,830
The first, of course,

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,280
is reconstructing the Branding Department.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,799
It costs too much money.

64
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,861
I doubt it.

65
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,480
Reconstruct the Branding Department.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,509
Qingchun, you don't know about it.

67
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,809
Branding Department has been a department

68
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,540
that wastes money.

69
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,190
If there's spare money, I think it should be spent on Public Relations Department

70
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,929
or Marketing Department or something. Everyone, am I right?

71
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:57,560
- Right.
- Yes.

72

and complete the transformation from brand to capital.

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,310
Well... So far, most of the cash flow is indeed in the project.

78
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,789
So only with the help of external force, can Huateng get through this.

79

So that the next projects can be completed successfully.

80

According to this settlement method...

81

Based on this settlement method...

82
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:41,039

00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,930
I'm getting off work.

329
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,140
Sure, see you downstairs.

How about noodles?

331
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,140
The noodle shop that I told you about last time.

332
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,240
Here.

333
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,980
Thanks.

334

Who are you looking for?

335
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,079
I'm looking for...

336
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,340
Me.

337
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,440
Qin Yinan. My best friend.

338

Wang Jiulong.

339
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,569
This is Eldest Wang's younger brother,

340
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:10,790
one of the bosses of this noodle shop.

341
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,459

342
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,280
Hello.

343
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,310
The same one?

344
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,250
Two bowls. One without coriander.

345
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,619
Another one with extra coriander.

346
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:21,629
Yes!

347
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,280
Wait a moment.

348
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,019
The design style changed so much compared to the previous one.

349
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,789
You've been abroad for so long. Do you still remember how it used to look like?

350
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,040
It's your favorite shop. How dare I forget.

351
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,150
Do you come here alone often?

352
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,329
It's been a while since I last visited.

353
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:44,579
But every time I come here, it reminds me of our good old days.

354
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,660
Oh, Brother Yinan! I haven't got the chance to ask.

355
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,379
Did the work handover go well after you come to Huateng?

356
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,940
Well, it's quite an unpleasant one.

357
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,089
But I guess it's a smooth transition.

358
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,760
Good to hear that.

359
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,619
What is the cooperation model between you and Su Zhinian?

360
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:14,809
Is he going to stay at Huateng all the time

361
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:17,620
or he'll be in the office occasionally?

362
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,929
For the first three months, he'll be in the office quite often.

363
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:23,220
After all, he invested a lot of money.

364
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,260
After the meal, I'm planning to visit Uncle Song.

365
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,089
Shall we ask Su Zhinian to come as well?

366
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:33,639
No, no need. No need to ask him.

367
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,350
Here you go.

368

Try Xiao Wang's cooking. The taste hasn't changed a bit.

375

He is equally good as Eldest Wang.

Let me try.

377

It tastes good.

378
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,590
But the portion is not quite right.

379

I'm his idol, this is my normal portion.

It's been a long time.

383

Eldest Wang. You didn't change at all.

Be brave! Have some courage!

Look, your competitor is here for her.

Are you just going to be Xiao Wang for the rest of your life?

What does it involve?

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,879
What's wrong?

396
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:14,599
I'm fine. It's probably because I haven't had lunch.

397

You can't skip lunch no matter how busy you are.

I was worried I couldn't finish work and celebrate with you.

It's fine. It's always been like this.

I'll be fine after a few bites.

00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,989
They received a donation last month and moved here.

494
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:27,599
Which press did you invite?

495
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,820
What press?

496
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,619
Are you trying to make others think that this is all for a show?

497
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,730
Forget what he said.

498
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,390
The main reason is that Huateng has been overexposed lately

499
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,939
and it has caused dissatisfaction from the public.

500
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:40,659
But I asked for Nuan Nuan's help.

501
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,699
She studied journalism.

502
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,579
She happened to be interested in producing a documentary.

503
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:46,909
That's why I asked for her help to write up some articles for Huateng Land.

504
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:48,280
Carry these in.

505
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,620
Let's go.

506
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,440
Brother Su!

507
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,700
Brother Su.

508
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,960
Brother Su. It's been so long since you last visited us.

509
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,590
That's right. Where's Brother Yan? Why is he not here?

510
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,359
Brother Su, I've learned to dribble.

511
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,180
I can play basketball with you guys.

512
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,899
No. I want you to play with me.

513
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:08,909
Me, too.

514
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,229
- I want Brother Su to play with me.
- Okay, all right, all right.

515
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,100
Okay.

516
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,439
No problem. I need to meet the director first.

517
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,659
Wait for me, all right?

518
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,580
Okay.

519
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,799
Go ahead and take some pictures.

520
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,149
Come on.

521
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,050
Let's take pictures.

522
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,759
Those on the first row, please squat down.

523
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,739
The director should be in the office waiting for us.

524
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,280
Let's go.

525
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,419
- Zheng Hao, start preparing when you got all the things.
- Yes.

526
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,799
I'll meet the director.

527
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,890
- I'll get going now.
- Okay. Go on.

528
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,110
How adorable.

529
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,670
Brother Yinan, you are here.

530
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,680
Didn't you say the director is in the office already?

531
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,090
She probably went out when she didn't see us.

532
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,140
Let's wait for her.

533
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,939
You are here.

534
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:44,220
- Hi, Director.
- I was wondering where you two went.

535
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,719
Are you looking at your old photos?

536
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,769
- That was Su Zhinian?
- That's right.

537
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:53,179
Look. The one on the left was Zhinian. On the right was Yan Yuan.

538
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,410
It doesn't look like them, right?

539
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,649
I'm not surprised.

540
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:58,549
It's been more than 20 years.

541
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:00,469
It's normal if you can't recognize the photo.

542
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:04,509
I found these when I shorting through some old stuff a while ago.

543
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:08,009
Take a look. Yan Yuan had just arrived back then.

544
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:11,719
She was just like your little tail, always following you wherever you went.

545
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,740
Well, that hasn't actually changed much.

546
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,750
Well, that's because you've always been protective of him.

547
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,420
But seeing both of you doing so well now

548
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,980
puts my heart to ease.

549
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,399
It has only been a few years, but he seems to be getting
more and more handsome.

550
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:29,839
This young lady here looks lovely as well.

551
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,040
She seems like a good match for Zhinian.

552
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,899
Let me introduce you.

553
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:39,569
She is Huateng Land's General Manager,

554
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:40,839
Song Qingchun.

555
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,999
She was the one who organized this event.

556
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:45,759
Nice to meet you, Miss Song.

557
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:48,089
Not only are you young and beautiful,

558
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:50,089
but you also have a kind heart.

559
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:54,059
Just like our Zhinian, who is always passionate and eager to lend a helping hand.

560
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,489
He left many years ago,

561
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,859
but he often comes back to visit our orphanage and help those little kids.

562
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:04,339
Every time, he would bring them lots of things. Food, toys, and the lot.

563
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:06,380
Isn't he a great young man?

564
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,460
He is a very kind young man.

565
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,840
Make sure you grab hold of the opportunity.

566
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,609
Miss Tang. Have some water.

567
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:26,939
Thank you, Brother Yinan.

568
00:36:26,939 --> 00:36:28,589
The kids here sure are adorable.

569
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:29,460
Indeed.

570
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,820
I'll take a few more pictures of them.

571
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,230
All right.

572
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,200
Have some water.

573
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,170
Thank you, Director Qin.

574
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,039
- Brother, do you know how to play the piano?
- Yes

575
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,339
Can you teach me how to play it then?

576
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:42,739
Of course. Come on. I'll take you to the piano.

577
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,639
Brother Su, let's play soccer together.

578
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,519
No. Brother Su promised he would teach us how to play Lego first.

579
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,949
All right. Let's play soccer together.

580
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,799
Qi Qi, Sister Song will play Lego with you, all right?

581
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:00,799
Okay.

582
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,810
- Come on.
- Let's go.

583
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,050
Do you want another photo?

584
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,739
Su Zhinian.

585
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,310
You guys carry on.

586
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,000
What is it?

587
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,529
I think I broke this.

588
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,130
You just have to do this.

589
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,419
It was that easy?

590
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,040
That's right.

591
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,940
That was all it took?

592
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,010
Look at Sister Tang.

593
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,020
Sister Song, look.

594
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,290
Did you make all of these?

595
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,550
Yes. I love making these.

596
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,109
I even gave some to Brother Su.

597
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,620
He loved them.

598
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,860
That's so nice.

599
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,190
Will you make some for me too, then?

600
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,259
Of course. Brother Su said that friends should share.

601
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,720
Come on. Let's play soccer.

602
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,529
Le Le, mind the ball.

603
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:48,019
- Come on. Let's continue building our pieces.
- Okay.

604
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:50,470
Director Song.

605
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,750
How did it go? It is all ready.

606
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,619
Good work today. You guys can head back first.

607
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:55,469
- All right.
- Goodbye, Director Song.

608
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,679
- Director Su.
- Goodbye, Director Su.

609
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

610
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,420
Gather around, kids.

611
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,460
Come here, dear.

612
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,959
It's time to get ready to put on your makeup.

613
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,620
Brother Su, the makeup lady isn't here yet.

614
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,279
We have the makeup lady right here.

615
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:10,679
Me?

616
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,740
Come on, let's go and put on your makeup.

617
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,760
Let's go.

618
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,799
- Come on, kids.
- Let's go.

619
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,029
Come on, let's get all of you dressed up.

620
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,630
Keep up.

621
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,940
Here.

622
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,760
Here. I'll take a picture of you.

623
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,059
You've violated my portrait rights, Miss Tang. You'll have to treat me to a meal.

624
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,300
Oh, you're just too charming, Brother Yinan.

625
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,040
I took so many pictures of you. I'll go bankrupt.

626
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,290
This photo looks nice.

627
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,589
Director Su usually appears cold and stoic,

628
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,510
but he actually seems to be quite popular among the kids.

629
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,990
All right. Stand up and let me take a look at you.

630
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,919
You look lovely, Princess Snow White. Who is your prince?

631
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,389
Brother Su.

632
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,639
Brother Su? You've got a distorted taste even at this age.

633
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,400
Better hurry up and change that.

634
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,100
It's almost time for the performance. Are they ready?

635
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,400
Who will be playing the little witch? She hasn't gotten her makeup done yet.

636
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,900
- It's Apple.
- Apple?

637
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,300
- Do you know where she is then?
- No.

638
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:20,000
I saw her go outside alone. I called out to her, but she didn't hear me. She doesn't like to talk either.

639
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
- Let's split up and look for her.
- Let's go.

640
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,700
You guys stay here and play for a while.

641
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,000
- Be good.
-This photo looks nice too.

642
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,400
Where could she be?

643
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,800
Qingchun, what's the matter?

644
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,200
One of the kids is missing.

645
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
Don't be anxious. We'll go and look for her.

646
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,000
You guys go ahead. I'll stay and look after the kids.

647
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,500
All right.

648
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,600
Apple!

649
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,000
Apple!

650
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Apple? Apple?

651
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Did you find her?

652
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,600
I couldn't find her either.

653
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,700
I asked the security guard as well. She didn't leave. She must still be inside here somewhere.

654
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,600
It's too dangerous. Let's call the police first.

[Warehouse]

656
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Apple?

657
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,579
Apple. Why were you hiding here?

658
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,800
Hurry up and go back. Everyone is waiting for you.

659
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,200
Where are you going?

660
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,600
Apple, did someone bully you?

661
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,500
Don't be afraid. I'll go and teach them a lesson for you.

662
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,400
Do you not want to perform?

663
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
That's all right.

664
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,000
If you don't, then you don't have to go onto the stage.

665
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Apple, it's all right if you don't,

666
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,400
we will stay here and keep you company.

667
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,500
I'll go and talk to her.

668
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
I used to be like you too.

669
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,400
I had no friends.

670
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,700
I liked to hide in a corner all alone by myself.

671
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,300
I was afraid of others coming near me,

672
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,600
but I also hoped someone would hold my hand

673
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
and tell me not to be afraid.

674
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,200
I waited for a long time.

675
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Then, one day,

676
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,400
someone took my hand

677
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,700
and told me earnestly he wanted to be my friend.

678
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,900
At first, I didn't dare to believe it.

679
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,100
I was afraid that he would dislike me or tease me.

680
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,300
I was afraid of being abandoned again.

681
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,700
But guess what happened to us in the end?

682
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,200
We fought, and we argued,

683
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
but until now,

684
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,800
we are still each other's best friends.

685
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Apple, may I have the honor

686
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,300
of becoming your best friend?

687

695

704
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,900
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,800
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

706
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,100
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

707
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,000
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

708
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

709
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,500
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
