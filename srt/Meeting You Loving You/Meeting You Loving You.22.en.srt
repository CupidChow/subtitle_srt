00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,973
Director Song!

336
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:00,560
Dad!

337
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,800
Dr. Yan, how is my father?

338
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,380
Don't worry. Dr. Yan is giving him a checkup right now.

339
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,380
He'll be done soon.

340
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
Okay. Thank you.

341
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,873
Cong Cong.

342
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,443
Dad.

343
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,140
He should be fine now.

344
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,520
Uncle Song was unconscious for three months.

345
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,760
It's not a very long time.

346
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,630
It won't be too hard for him to go through physical therapy.

347
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,550
But he still needs to take special care of his health and mind his diet.

348
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,670
Got it.

349
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,630
Dad!

350
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,150
You stay here and keep him company then.

351
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,750
I'll go and handle the other procedures.

352
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,593
Let's go.

353
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,420
Qingchun.

354
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,610
- Dad.
- You've had it hard.

355
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,140
It's all my fault.

356
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,990
I'm fine, Dad.

357
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,420
I've been well.

358
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,760
Huateng has been well too.

359
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,010
Su Zhinian helped me.

360
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,040
He's a good kid.

361
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,150
I was right about him.

362
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,150
He is wonderful.

363
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,733
You guys...

364
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,123
Dad.

365
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,230
We're together now.

366
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,620
A lot of things happened

367
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,930
when you were unconscious.

368
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,460
Speaking of the matter...

369
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,730
I am responsible

370
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,130
for what happened to Chen Han as well.

371
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,730
As for Yi Nan...

372
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,920
Well, I failed to see through his true colors.

373
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,360
That's enough, Chairman Song.

374
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,930
That's all in the past now. Let's not mention it anymore.

375
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,630
Come in.

376
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,463
Wait for me.

377
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

378
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,100
Are you Miss Song Qingchun?

379
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,040
Yes, I am.

380
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,730
Please come with us for a bit.

381
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,563
All right.

382
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:22,280
I'll be right back.

383
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,630
Thank you for your cooperation.

384
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,370
You don't have to see us out. We'll head back on our own.

385
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,900
It was all thanks to the police last night.

386
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,660
It is our duty.

387
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,290
Chen Han fell into the river when he tried to escape.

388
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,630
Our rescue team has yet to find him.

389
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,250
We will follow up on that matter.

390
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,250
So, for the time being, please avoid going out if possible.

391
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,390
Stay safe.

392
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,040
Understood. Thank you for your hard work.

393
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,150
If you have any problems, contact us at any time.

394
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,380
All right.

395
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

396
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,510
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

397
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,200
I came today to apologize to you and also to say goodbye.

398
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,440
I'll go to the police station and turn myself in after this.

399
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,790
You knew I was involved with the Pearl Residence case a long time ago, didn't you?

400
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,090
That's why you used Li Damin's mistress's phone to test me.

401
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,490
I couldn't figure out why you did what you did.

402
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:43,250
Did our family do anything to you?

403
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
It's the contrary.

404
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,450
You guys were too perfect.

405
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,730
I remember the first day my father and I came to the Song residence.

406
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,860
You smiled as you came down from the stairs, calling me your brother.

407
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,460
I didn't even dare to answer you.

408
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,490
I was afraid you would mock my accent.

409
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,830
You were such a bright light that shined a light on a part of me growing up.

410
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,220
I felt inferior in front of you.

411
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,520
Yet, I couldn't help but want to get closer to you.

412
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,040
Be it our statuses or other backgrounds, I knew

413
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,960
you were too far out of my league.

414
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,940
So all those years, I only dared to watch you from afar

415
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,440
and stay by your side as your brother.

416
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,130
I remember when we were younger, a lot of my peers were envious that I had a brother like you.

417
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,210
At that time, I thought we would always be that close.

418
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,810
Except that I was too self-insecure and paranoid back then.

419
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,250
That's why Su Zhinian's appearance made me panic and jealous.

420
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,040
He was smarter than me, more mature,

421
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,700
and could even earn your father's acknowledgment.

422
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,560
So I was jealous of him.

423
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,760
I was afraid that he would take you away from me,

424
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,910
which made me want you even more.

425
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,650
I don't know when it started, but winning you over became an obsession.

426
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,760
As if winning you over was the only way to prove that I didn't lose to him.

427
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,270
And to compensate for my insecurities.

428
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,443
I'm sorry, Qingchun.

429
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,553
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:23,130
Everything happened because of me.

431
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,361
But whether you believe me or not, I never wanted to hurt you and Uncle Song.

432
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,880
At first, it was just an accident.

433
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,570
Then, Huateng got into trouble.

434
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,150
I grew selfish and had ulterior motives.

435
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,250
I wanted to return to you as your savior when you were most vulnerable.

436
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:47,360
That's why I never answered your calls, which led to the return of Su Zhinian.

437
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,250
I didn't expect that Chen Han would take advantage of me.

438
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,540
When I wanted to stop, everything was too late.

439
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,560
That's why I can't bring myself to hate you, but I can't forgive you either.

440
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,090
Qingchun.

441
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,140
Dad.

442
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,710
Why were you gone for so long?

443
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,720
I ran into an acquaintance and was held up by the conversation.

444
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,870
Dad. How are you feeling right now?

445
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,880
Fine, I suppose.

446
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,580
Then, I have something important to tell you.

447
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,760
Later.

448
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,670
I can tell it's not something good.

449
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,120
I just woke up.

450
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
Give me some time.

451
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,980
I can't, Dad. I have to tell you right now.

452
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,810
Because we'll be leaving first thing tomorrow morning.

453
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,090
Leaving?

454
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,120
To where?

455
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,290
To... the Yingjiang District

456
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,100
Civil Affairs Bureau.

457
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,490
Su Zhinian is a very good man.

458
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,150
He treats me very well.

459
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,650
When Huateng was in trouble,

460
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,490
the funds from Geiger Capital in those rumors

461
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,040
were actually his personal savings.

462
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,290
He would risk being questioned by the board to invest in Huateng.

463
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,540
He let me stay at his place because he was worried about my safety.

464
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,480
He wanted to protect me at all times.

465
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,980
He forced me to learn how to manage a company

466
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,890
because... because he was worried

467
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,670
I wouldn't be able to handle the people and matters in business on my own.

468
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:30,970
At my weakest and most vulnerable, he carefully protected my dignity

469
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,660
and guided me to grow step by step.

470
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,193
Dad.

471
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,063
There won't be

472
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,560
another man who will treat me as well as he does in this world

473
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,730
apart from you.

474
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,630
He is ill.

475
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,500
In five days, he will have to undergo a very important operation.

476
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,330
I don't know what the outcome will be.

477
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,450
But I want to be with him.

478
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,390
I want him to become part of our family.

479
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,140
I want to become his wife.

480
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,210
Even if it's only

481
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,650
for a day.

482
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,090
And if...

483
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,510
I don't agree?

484
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,123
Dad...

485
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:34,880
Uncle Song.

486
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,940
It might be abrupt for me to say this,

487
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,090
but I would still like to ask you to entrust her to me.

488
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,140
Qingchun might not have told you this.

489
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,110
In five days, I will undergo an operation.

490
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,780
However, the success rate is only 20 percent.

491
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,930
I know this is selfish of me.

492
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:59,940
A father would never entrust their daughter to someone without a future.

493
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,430
Is that your decision?

494
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,650
Or both of yours?

495
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,080
Have you ever considered

496
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,190
what would happen to her

497
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,080
if your surgery fails?

The only thing I can do

is to ensure that she spends every day happily while I am around.

And in those days without me, she'll feel content and peaceful.
