The owners of Pearl Residence are asking for a refund.

316
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:16,794
Huateng Land might have to pay a great fortune to compensate their customers.

317
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:18,835
How will the board overcome the situation?

318
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:21,174
Shenghua Construction still owes several downstream companies their payment.

319
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:23,554
Now that the project has been ceased, as the mother company, Huateng Land...

320
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:29,474
I can't believe these associates used Miss Song who has no experience in running the company as their scapegoat.

321
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,555
They are hopeless.

322
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:34,744
I am terribly sorry for the trouble Huateng Land has caused you.

323
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:37,254
It even left a negative impact on society.

324
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:39,545
We will announce the compensation solution as soon as possible.

325
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:42,834
How are you going to pay? You are nothing but a scapegoat!

326
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:47,924
You are not getting away with this! We want answers! We want answers!

327
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:52,195

328
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:54,655

329
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,064
Everyone, calm down!

330
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:59,554
Please believe us, Huateng Land will overcome this difficult time.

331
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:02,014
Is Song Meng Hua playing dead? We want him!

332

Everyone, calm down!

334
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:21,775
For the moment, I haven't decided to take over my father's company,

335
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:25,074
but the Song family is still the controlling shareholder
of Huateng Land.

336
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:30,244
As the controlling shareholder, I promise you that with enough time,

337
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:33,315
- we will deliver the compensation you want.
- How long is that going to take?

338
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:49,234
Give us 100 days, I need 100 days.

339
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:52,530
- You said 100 days?
- That's too long!

After compensating the victims, she needs other contracts to keep the company operational.

344

Not even the most brilliant mind can make it happen.

345
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:14,674
Fortunately, our contract with them hasn't been signed.

346
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:19,004
Director Su, should we make an official notice to terminate the partnership?

347
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,215
Let me think about it.

348
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:28,295
I want to know how much money I can allocate.

349
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,925
Yes.

352

I came to inform you that Geiger Capital

00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:00,955
will terminate all partnerships with Huateng Land.

354
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:05,904
I'm surprised you actually came in-person to inform me.

355
00:28:05,904 --> 00:28:07,734
I know you want to make fun of me.

356
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:10,235
It's my duty to see to it personally.

357
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:15,054
No one would let a person who knows nothing be their president.

358

Unless... they want to go bankrupt.

359
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:25,605
Fine, I get it. You can leave now.

360
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:28,840
Aren't you going to persuade me?

361
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:36,164
If you miraculously managed to get Huateng Land back on track in only 100 days,

362
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:41,294
Geiger Capital would love to be Huateng Land's partner in the future.

363
00:28:41,294 --> 00:28:43,905
I made it clear four years ago.

364
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:46,695
I want nothing to do with you.

365
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,884
Perhaps I should make it clearer to you.

366
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:52,615
Huateng Land will never join hands with Geiger Capital.

367
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:56,684
You might think your response in front of the media
was very brave.

368
00:28:56,684 --> 00:29:01,694
However, mere bravado isn't enough to lead a company.

369
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:06,304
You've delivered very unpleasant news to the world.

370

You told them the heir of Huateng Land is very unprofessional.

371
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,205
This company is hopeless.

372

A word of advice, cash out the shares you have and get back to your normal life.

373

Take care of yourself and your father.

That's what's best for you.

375

My father will wake up after three months.

376
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:33,395
I don't want him to wake up and see the mess I create.

I bet she thinks running a company is just as easy as working as a fashion show host.

381
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:58,615
What a joke. This is hilarious.

It's not a regular show. If you're concerned or not ready to face the cameras,

00:36:02,408 --> 00:36:04,408
I'm flattered.

473
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:07,888
Yaqi Jewelry will soon launch its True-Love Series.

474
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:09,457
I insist on gifting you a necklace.

475
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,358
How generous of you, but it's not necessary.

476
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,578
Don't stand on ceremony.

477
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:17,308
Who is helping me?

478
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,388
Did I tossed it?

479
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,438
But I'm totally sober.

480
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,778
- Let me fill the glass for you.
- Thanks.

481
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,057
Sorry, Director Wan. It's late and I must go now.

482
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,557
I'd love to dance with you.

483
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:36,548
I'm not a great dancer.

484
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,437
- Let me drive you home then.
- It's all right, thank you.

485
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:40,648
My car is right outside.

486
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:43,107
She has a car and also has a dance partner.

487
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:45,328
And he is...

488
00:36:47,948 --> 00:36:51,078
I am rather interested in your proposal.

489
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:53,028
I'm free to discuss it now.

490
00:36:56,198 --> 00:36:57,757
Let go.

491
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,387
Play along for now.

492
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:02,848
First of all, I doubt you'd want to be around Director Wan.

493
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,508
Secondly, if they find out you and Geiger Capital are no longer partners,

494
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,228
no one will want to help Huateng Land.

495
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,747
I don't remember giving you any proposal.

496
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:23,307
You've never changed at all.

497
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:27,178
If I didn't lie, you'd still be pestered by that perv.

498
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,368
Mind your own business.

499
00:37:29,368 --> 00:37:30,747
Take your jacket.

500
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,927
He was clearly taking advantage of you. Don't you know that?

501
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:37,977
Is saving your father's company worth getting humiliated at a social event?

502
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:41,457
Why do you even care? Am I a joke to you?

503
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:44,198
If you are not more cautious,

504
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,148
you'll make a fool out of yourself.

505
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:53,118
What are you even thinking?

506
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:07,458
Stop following me, Su Zhinian!

507
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:11,927
Listen carefully. I'm not so washed-up that even you can mock me.

508
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,698
Close the door.

509
00:38:17,848 --> 00:38:19,428
My service ends in 10 minutes.

510
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:22,418
I hope I get to work for another half an hour.

511
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,948
Sorry. I'm so sorry, Mister.

512
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:53,037
- May I ask if you are done in the back?
- Hold on.

513
00:38:56,018 --> 00:38:58,637
Miss, I must inform you

514
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:01,347
that you've only booked the car for four hours.

515
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:04,537
The service expires in five minutes. Do you want to top up?

516
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:07,867
And I must clarify that the rate after 10 PM

517
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:11,177
is 50 percent more than our usual rate.

518
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:14,457
After 30 minutes, we'll charge by the hour.

519
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:17,647
I'll pass. You can drop me off up ahead. Thank you.

520
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,018
Sure.

521
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:52,058
This is a typical case of abnormal cerebral cortex activity.

522
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:57,278
But in practice, cerebral inhibition is a critical sign of the brain's maturity.

523
00:39:57,278 --> 00:40:01,417
It makes our reflexes more precise while keeping the neurons safe.

524
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:03,577
It is a biological function that enables us

525
00:40:03,578 --> 00:40:07,817
to perceive the world and coordinate our body's movements.

526
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:41,457
Senior, humans only have limited access to their brains.

527
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:45,647
Can we understand it as the neocortex has limited humans' potentials?

528
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:49,098
Those with metahuman abilities have broken through the limitations.

529
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:53,578
If you put it that way, it could be a solution.

530
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:56,027
She's the boss' target. Get her.

531
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:06,328
Normally, deficiency in cerebral inhibition

532
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:08,748
will cause bipolar disorder,

533
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:11,377
but theoretically speaking, there is a slim chance

534
00:41:11,377 --> 00:41:15,228
to develop the human brain even further.

535
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:18,497
It might even enable one to control

536
00:41:18,497 --> 00:41:22,817
another person's mind or action with brainwaves.

537
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:26,597
That might be what has been known as

538
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:27,867
superpower.

539
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:32,337
Senior, have you met anyone who has surpassed the inhibition?

540
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:43,237
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right. Watch out!

541
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:04,398
Modern medicine and technology have come a long way,

542
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:07,358
but the human brain is still

543
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,877
full of unknown mysteries that we must discover.

544
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:14,957
- Su Zhinian, are you all right?
- Is it bad?

545
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:16,928
I'm calling an ambulance.

546
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:18,678
No need.

547
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:20,248
Let's get out of here.

548
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:21,958
Send me home.

549
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:38,578
Careful here.

550
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,897
Are you all right? I should get going if you are all right.

551
00:42:58,948 --> 00:43:02,458
If it's that bad, let me call an ambulance.

552
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,428
I am fine.

553
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:05,868
Fine.

554
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:09,017
You said you're fine. Anyway, you friend is on his way.

555
00:43:09,017 --> 00:43:10,537
Thank you for helping out.

556
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:13,457
Please, don't. Saving your neck is just harming humanity.

557
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,057
It's nothing to be proud of.

558
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:19,077
Huateng Land's partnership with Geiger Capital can continue.

559
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:23,157
I'll invest my capital in Huateng Land and help you reorganize.

560
00:43:23,157 --> 00:43:26,437
I'll get your father the best doctor to treat him.

561
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,358
But with only one condition.

562
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,017
Move into my place and be my assistant for 100 days.

563
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,250
