To maximize the value of the assets...

84

After reading so many books, do you know what a non-performing asset is?

85
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,340
Based on current observation, the non-performing assets industry is
rich in resources.

86
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,199
It is a broad concept.

The thing is, when it comes to non-performing assets,

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,920
as long as it has a new profit point, it can still produce value.

Just the other day, I was almost squashed to death in the lift.

162
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:26,540
Since you've decided, let's not waste time.

163
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,899
Please line up here.

164
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,139
- Come on.
- Let's go.

165
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,299
Director Song, what about you?

166
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:32,260
I'll join them.

167
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,540
Okay, let's get into position.

168
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,059
I'll start recording.

169
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,670
Are you ready?

170
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,299
We'll start if you're ready.

171
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,560
Three. Two. One. Action!

172
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
One!

173
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,580
Two!

174
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,179
That's the spirit.

175
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,370
A close-up on you, Director Song.

176
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,120
- Zheng Hao!
- Three!

177
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,810
What are you doing?

178
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,900
Director Qin, it's a new regulation.

179
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,639
You're the general manager. You're different from other employees.

180
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,709
Some incidents will inevitably delay you from coming to work on time.

181
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,809
- Did Su Zhinian force you do this?
- No.

182
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,040
- He—
- I'll talk to him.

183
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,179
Do we still need to do it?

184
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,209
Before a new rule is announced, we'll continue with the existing rule.

185
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,060
Continue.

186
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,910
Director Su, Qingchun is Huateng Land's CEO.

187
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,139
You made her do squats in front of so many people. It will affect her negatively.

188
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,940
How can she manage the company with others' respect in the future?

189
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,960
If an employer can't even be punctual,

190
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,540
how can she earn others' respect?

191
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,140
She was only one minute late.

192
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,419
One minute is enough for a public company's stock to reach its bottom limit

193
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:52,780
and make those who bought the stock go bankrupt.

194
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,400
There are even more serious cases. Do you want me to tell you one by one?

195
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,110
Don't you think you're being too harsh on her?

196
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,310
She's no longer the high school student you tutored.

197
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,639
Director Qin, may I know if you work

198
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,790
while reporting to your subordinate?

199
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,690
So do I need to work while reporting to you?

200
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,909
Do you think coming to work on time can solve Huateng's current crisis?

201
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,350
Of course, not.

202
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,809
So I'll be very busy these days.

203
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,679
Also, please don't waste my time on something like this.

204
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,519
Just do your job.

205
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,540
I'm doing this for Qingchun's sake.

206
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,679
I don't care why you invested in Huateng Land.

207
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,710
But as long as I'm around, I won't let you hurt Qingchun again.

208
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,160
Director Qin.

209
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,469
Directgor Su, We've bid the Song's family house. Miss Song can move in anytime.

210
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,059
Don't tell her first.

211
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,759
Also, put back the seal, and leave everything in its original state.

212
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,659
Today is Zijin Harbor launch.

213
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:13,060
Tell her to do market research right away.

214
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,499
Submit the report to me when she comes to work tomorrow.

215
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:17,040
Okay.

216
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,690
[Alexander Brand]

217
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,670
- I'm sorry.
- Young lass, why don't you watch where you're going?

218
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,329
- I'm sorry.
-You'll have to pay for this.

219
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,579
You must compensate me!

220
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,440
Compensate you?

221
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,389
My wife prepared this jade as a dowry for my daughter.

222
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:17,950
It's a family heirloom that can't be bought anywhere!

223
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,139
It's broken into pieces now! You must pay for this jade!

224
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:22,429
You must pay.

225
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,279
Excuse me. I didn't even come into contact with you just now.

226
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,239
Moreover, we don't even know where this jade comes from.

227
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,529
No contact?

228
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,289
Hey, you didn't watch where you were going.

229
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:35,540
You broke my jade into pieces. Yet you refused to admit it!

230
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,600
Just look at her. What kind of attitude is this?

231
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,289
I'm only treating you the way you deserve.

232
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:45,669
I think you were faking it to extort me!

233
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:47,139
What did you say?

234
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,629
You broke my jade into pieces, and you're saying I'm trying to extort you?

235
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:51,139
Officer, how about this?

236
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:54,349
We can check the surveillance or wait for my lawyer friend to come.

237
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,389
Then you can follow the procedure.

238
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:57,759
Don't try to scare me.

239
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,579
Aren't you lying too?

240
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,919
Enough. Say no more.

241
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,630
After the CCTV footage is here, everything will be clear.

242
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,979
You two, write down the contact number of the people we can contact.

243
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,490
Write it.

244
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,349
Hello, Director Su.

245
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:40,099
Where's Song Qingchun?

246
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:44,569
I told her to do market research, not shopping. Tell her to come out after she's done.

247
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:49,099
She has finished the market research. But she's being extorted and is currently trying to settle it.

248
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,339
Is your friend's name Qin Yinan?

249
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,660
Yes.

250
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,470
He'll be here anytime soon. Wait here.
[Civil Mediation Room]

251
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,110
Sir, my friend is a lawyer

252
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,239
- who especially takes care of con men like you.
- Who's the con man here?

253
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,209
Sir, don't feel guilty.

254
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,760
Stop trying to scare me.

255
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,100
Song Qingchun, your lawyer friend is here.

256
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,110
What are you doing here?

257
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,499
I get the general picture now. How do you want to settle it?

258
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:32,229
How? Pay up. Not a cent less.

259
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,010
Pay? Sure.

260
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,670
Why? I didn't break it. Why should I pay him?

261
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,639
It's a small matter. Not important.

262
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,540
Now, let's talk about the part you need to be responsible for.

263
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,770
Compensation for mental distress, work delay, and medical fees.

264
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,680
Based on Miss Song Qingchun's position at Huateng Land,

265
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,269
how much do you think is appropriate if you add those fees together?

266
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,909
You... Officer, help me out here.

267
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:00,909
They're using their power to oppress me.

268
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,300
- I'm the complainant here! It was her fault!
- What she said should be true.

269
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,000
I believe her.

270
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
The police who investigated this matter have called. Wait here.

271
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Why are the rich so stingy now?

272
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,600
You wanted to extort 2,000 yuan. But you insisted on coming to the police station.

273
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
You can only come on hard now that you can't turn back.

274
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
The color of this jade is not bad.

275
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,400
But a jade that broke moments ago

276
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,000
shouldn't have such smooth edges.

277
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,400
I don't know what you're saying. It's my bad luck today.

278
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,600
It's my bad luck, okay? I won't sue anymore.

279
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,500
What's the rush? This isn't a place where you can come and go.

280
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,300
Someone happened to record a video of you bumping into her on purpose. Come with me.

281
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,400
Officer, let me explain it to you.

282
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
Stop talking nonsense. Come with me.

283
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,500
This is a real jade.

284
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Director Song, do you like this place?

285
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,100
Stay here, then.

286
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,200
Why are you here?

287
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
I gave the police Brother Yinan's contact number.

288
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Why am I here?

289
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
The police told me.

290
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,300
If you're not willing to go, you can go back inside and wait for Qin Yinan.

291
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,200
Wait. No matter what, thank you for helping me today.

292
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,000
I never expected you'd trust me unconditionally.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
There are many things you don't know.

294
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,900
I know what kind of person you are.

295
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,000
Isn't it weird?

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,700
That old man was trying to extort me but denied it to the end.

297
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,500
How did you know he bumped into me on purpose

298
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,200
and wanted to extort 2,000 yuan from me?

299
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
I used deception to confuse him.

300
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
You sure have some tricks.

301
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
Can't you have more common sense and be careful?

302
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,900
Stop trying to act tough in front of other people.

303
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,800
Don't you know this is dangerous?

304
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay.

305
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,800
I'll remember that.

306
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,100
Brother Yinan.

307
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,500
Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you?

308
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm okay.

309
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,900
I was delayed by traffic. Thank you, Director Su.

310
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,900
Let's go. Nuan Nuan should be off work now. We'll be there in time if we leave now.

311
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,500
Okay.

312
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,100
Director Su, do you want to join us for dinner?

313
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Not interested.

314
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
Let's go, then.

315
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay.

316
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Careful.

317
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
It's hot.

318
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
Brother Yinan, I'm starving. Can you make me a bowl of noodles first?

319
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
I'll do it right away.

320
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Qingchun, why don't you watch TV first. I'll call you when I'm done.

321
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
Let me take one more.

322
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What's wrong? You don't like it?

323
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,400
No, not at all. I thought you'd make me fish ramen.

324
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
It's delicious.

325
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

326
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Congratulations to Miss Song Qingchun for being appointed as Huateng Land's CEO.

327
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Welcome back, Brother Yinan.

328
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,800
Then I'll wish Nuan Nuan's program have high ratings.

329
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,500
Thank you.

330
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,700
You worked all day. Leave them there. I'll do it. There aren't many dishes.

331
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
Qingchun, it's already late.

332
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400
- Why don't we leave first?
- Okay.

333
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,600
Wait. I'll send you home.

334
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
This one too.

335
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,900
I saw how much you like crayfish, so I packed some for you. You can reheat it and eat it tomorrow.

336
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,800
Thank you, Brother Yinan.

337
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,900
Let's go.

338
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,900
Okay, let's go.

339
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,400
Brother Yinan, do you want to come in for a while?

340
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,600
- Sure.
- Don't!

341
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I mean next time.

342
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
I just moved my stuff here, and I haven't unpacked my things. It's embarrassing to let other's see.

343
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,500
I won't go this time. You must clean it up before I come next time. Don't trouble Nuan Nuan.

344
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,300
Okay.

345
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,000
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

346
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
- Thank you, Brother Yinan.
- Okay, see you tomorrow.

347
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,500
See you.

348
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
Bye-bye.

349
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,800
Are you heading back there or spending the night at my place?

350
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
I have to head back. I must not breach the agreement and let him hold something against me.

351
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,700
- You should rest early. I'll get going.
- Okay.

352
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

355
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,200
Hello?

356
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,800
Hello. Can you open the door for me?

357
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
The passcode is not working.

358
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,100
It's past the curfew.

359
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,100
I know. It's my fault this time.

360
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Are you taking our agreement lightly?

361
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm not. Please open the door.

362
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,700
I even brought delicious food back for you.

363
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay.

364
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
It smells so good.

365
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,800
Here you go. I've reheated it for you.

366
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
Eat one while it's still hot.

367
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Try it.

368
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
How is it? Is it delicious?

369
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,300
Is it especially delicious?

370
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,100
I ate a big plate of it.

371
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,500
It's been a long time since I had Brother Yinan's cooking. It's still as great as before.

372
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,800
- Qin Yinan made this?
- Yes.

373
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,000
Fresh crayfish is so tasty that I had more than enough.

374
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
- What's wrong?  - I'm full.

375
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,900
Wasteful. I'll eat it all.

376
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
What are you snickering about?

377
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
You'll get fat if you overeat.

378
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,200
It's none of your business.

379
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,000
Then go on the scale.

380
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,700
Fine, I'll weigh myself. Watch it carefully.

381
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,900
What's going on? How can I be over 50 kg?

382
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
The scale must be faulty.

383
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
What are you laughing at?

384
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,600
You, fatso.

385
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm only bloated. What do you know?

386
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,500
I only need to have yogurt for three days. I'll be the goddess again.

387
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,200
Yogurt can't save you.

388
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,400
You should change into sportswear.

389
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,800
Why should I?

390
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,200
Let me save you.

391
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,100
You?

392
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,400
It's late in the evening.

393
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
You're acting like you're having a fan meeting.

394
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm someone with more than one million followers.

395
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,800
If someone saw me jogging with a young man late at night, it'll affect my image.

396
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't run anymore.

397
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,800
Hang in there.

398
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,700
Let's run two more rounds.

399
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
Overtake me? Run by yourself, then.

400
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm so exhausted.

401
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,400
If the Bluetooth connection is disconnected, you'll have to run one extra round.

402
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,400
What a snake. Just you wait.

403
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
What's wrong?

404
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,100
Nothing. I twisted my ankle.

405
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,300
- Let me massage it for you.
- No need.

406
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm okay.

407
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm okay. You go ahead. I'll catch up with you. Go.

408
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,600
Jerk. Trying to mess with me?

409
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,800
You're still an amateur. Run by yourself.

410
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,000
Stop running. I can't run anymore.

411
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
Can we go home now?

412
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,200
Where's your earphone?

413
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,900
Isn't it...

414
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Where's my earphone?

415
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,100
Oh, I know. I must have dropped it.

416
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
I'll buy you a new one. Sorry about that.

417
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,900
I've run six rounds today. It should be enough, right?

418
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,620
Six rounds?

419
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,700
Why is your heart rate only 81, then?

420
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,200
I did run six rounds.

421
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,900
Didn't you hear it with your Bluetooth earphone?

422
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,100
Do you mean this earphone that you accidentally dropped in my hood?

423
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Did you pick it up on the road? That's great. I can save my money, then.

424
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,700
Another five rounds as punishment. We're not going home if you don't finish running.

425
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,079
What?

426
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,600
How can I be infatuated with this poker face?

427
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,500
No. I must see pictures of handsome men to get him out of my head!

428
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,400
You can't lie down after strenuous exercise.

429
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,200
So you knew it was strenuous.

430
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
I'll break apart if I don't lie down.

431
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,900
If you do this,

432
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,600
the blood will accumulate in the hips.

433
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,200
What do you mean?

434
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Your bottom will become bigger.

435
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,400
What?

436
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,500
I have a solid foundation, so I'm not scared at all.

437
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Speaking of which, everything in your house is great.

438
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
But you lack a massage chair.

439
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,900
What do you think about this?
[Multi-functional massage chair]

440
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,500
How about getting one?

441
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
I hate massage.

442
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,300
You obviously never went to a high-end spa.

443
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,600
Come on.

444
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,800
Lie on your belly. Hurry.

445
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,300
Take off your slippers.

446
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,200
Quickly.

447
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,700
Lie on your belly.

448
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
Lie down.

449
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,500
Relax.

450
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,000
Gently.

451
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
Don't worry.

452
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Relax. Just relax a little.

453
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,400
How is it?

454
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
Not bad, right?

455
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,600
I'll buy it!

456
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,800
You'll buy it?

457
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,900
Okay.

458
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,400
Why don't you try it out?

459
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
You're being generous.

460
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Are you trying to fool me again?

461
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,800
You have to pay for every use.

462
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,500
That's fine, then.

463
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,500
Twenty yuan? You crook.

464
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,600
Others only charge 10 yuan per usage.

465
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,200
The prices for the economy and first-class are also different.

466
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
So this is a reasonable price.

467
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,700
But you didn't provide any appropriate special service.

468
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,800
From the consumer's experience perspective, it doesn't have the best value for money.

469
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,100
You won't have return customers.

470
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Would you like something to drink? Coffee or tea?

471
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,000
Coffee.

472
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,800
Help me switch on the TV. Pass me the remote.

473
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,200
Light the incense.

474
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Cut the apples for me. I want it in cubes.

475
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,100
Oh, the Americano. I want double shots with no ice.

476
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,700
Thank you.

477
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
All right, Miss Song. Please wait.

478
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
Okay.

479
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,900
Miss Song, I've prepared all that you need.

480
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,800
The happiness of such a comeback is truly unimaginable.

481

I'll spend 100 yuan every week

482
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
to experience such a special service every day.

483
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
What's going on?

484
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,600
Su Zhnian, what did you do?

485
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
A comeback is nothing.

486
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,500
Setting your straight is the best service.

487
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,400
Su Zhinian, stop this thing!

488
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,200
Enjoy yourself.

489
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Su Zhinian, I'm going to get you "Cai Kangyong's Way of Speaking"

490
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,400
on your birthday to improve your EQ!

491
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,800
That's the latest model. You must get it.

492
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,000
You're taking it too lightly.

493
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,300
Get in.

494
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,400
Tell me how much it is for the ride first.

495
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
The bus only costs four yuan.

496
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,800
I can even get discounts with a card.

497
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,200
Quickly now. I have something to discuss with you.

498
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,600
When the investigation team comes, they'll head to the construction site.

499
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,100
I'll make the arrangement.

500
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,300
The collapse of Pearl Residence is mainly related to building materials.

501
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,800
Get them to prepare all related documents.

502
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Vice President Li has the documents.

503
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,400
I also suspect he's hiding something.

504
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,000
Drop me after this junction.

505
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,200
We'll only reach the company at the next junction.

506
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,300
That's why I must get off here.

507
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,800
What am I going to do if Brother Yinan saw us together?

508
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,799
Brother Yinan.

509
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,400
Why didn't you take a car?

510
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm scared there will be a traffic jam.

511
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,200
So I got off earlier.

512
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
I'll pick you up to work next time.

513
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,200
It's okay. With apps, taxi-hailing is very convenient now.

514
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,600
Okay then. I'm going to be busy with Pearl Residence's case. So I might be at the office that often.

515
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,800
By the way, do you know that the investigation team will come?

516
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,200
They're coming this afternoon. Will you be there?

517
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,000
Of course. Get in.

518
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,370
[Police Line]

519
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,800
- What's wrong with Director Su?
- Director Su, you're here.

520
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,000
He doesn't look too happy.

521
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Who knows? Just ignore him. Let's go.

522
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,800
Do you know where you are now?

523
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't you have any common sense at all?

524
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,100
Or do you want to end up in the Social Edition again?

525
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,000
Let me help you.

526
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm sorry.

527
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
- My hair.
- Qingchun, I'm sorry.

528
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,800
I feel jet-lagged recently.

529
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I read some backlog of documents all night.

530
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,900
So I'm feeling a little absent-minded now. I'm sorry.

531
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,200
It's okay. Feeling jet-lagged is the worst.

532
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,400
I'll take you out to relax after this.

533
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,000
- I know a traditional remedy.
- Okay.

534
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Don't you think it's still too early to relax?

535
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,600
If you have spare time, you should memorize more concepts and cases.

536
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,200
Lest you search on Baidu under the desk during meetings.

537
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,700
Director Su,

538
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,900
if Qingchun did anything wrong, you can tell her nicely, or you can tell me.

539
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,000
I can help her correct it.

540
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Director Qin, if you have time to help her,

541
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,800
you should take care of Pearl Residence's case first.

542
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,600
Just ignore him. That's how he is. Let's go.

543
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,900
Let's check out where the accident happened.

544
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,450
