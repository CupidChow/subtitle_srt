20
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,640
- Good morning, Director Song.
- Morning.

21
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,570
Qingchun.

22
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,149
You're early today. Have you eaten breakfast?

23
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,620
Yes.

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,189
Are you still mad at me?

25
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,129
It's not a big deal. I'm not a kid anyway.

26
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,299
It was my fault yesterday.

27
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,300
I was too harsh. I'm sorry. Can you forgive me?

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,609
It's okay. I know it was out of concern.

29
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:21,530
I've made a reservation at Jinling Restaurant. Let's hang out tonight.

30
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,630
Tonight?

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,609
I can't make it tonight. I have plans.

32
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:31,969
I still have a morning meeting later. So I have to go now.

33
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,170
Enough already. Stop snapping pictures.

34
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,660
- How many have you snapped?
- One last one.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,210
One last one.

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,750
They're here. Come on.

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,299
The company has succeeded in locking down Wancheng Group.

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,570
- Director Song. Director . Su, great work!
- Director Song. Director Su, great work!

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,499
You guys did a great job too. At noon, Director Su will treat you to lunch.

40
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,749
- We'll celebrate it.
- Great. Okay, Director Su.

41
00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:01,230
Celebrating is fine. But it's still working hours now.

42
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,740
We shouldn't distract other employees at work.

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,400
Director Su...

44
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,229
Doesn't Director Su like cakes?

45
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,109
I told you Director Su doesn't eat cakes.

46
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,769
My idol is a cool person who doesn't eat common food.

47
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,109
But these cakes are extremely popular online. I waited in line for a long time to buy these.

48
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,299
Just ignore him.

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,749
Maybe he's hiding alone in his office, feeling overjoyed. Let's enjoy the cake.

50
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:25,829
- Okay.
- Sure.

51
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,580
- Sit down.
- Come.

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,330
- Which one should we try?
- I want this one.

53
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,330
I like this one.

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,429
They meant well. You should have treated them warmly.

55
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:52,249
The obstacles for the Qinghu project have been endless since it started.

56
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,250
Everyone in the company knows about this.

57
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,119
Apart from that, it can only be considered a good start

58
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,730
though we've got the project.

59
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,450
So it's too early to celebrate.

60
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,029
You're right about that. But as a supervisor,

61
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:07,529
shouldn't you give more encouragement to the youngsters?

62
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:10,719
Do you think they're like me, who can still treat my job as if it's my first love

63
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,170
after being tormented by you?

64
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,620
I thought you only knew about heartbreak.

65
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,719
How ignorance can limit your imagination.

66
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,609
I didn't know you could imagine first love.

67
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,230
That's enlightening.

68
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,029
Whatever. As for the Qinghu project, I'll monitor everyone

69
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,770
and make sure there is no issue anymore.

70
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,040
Wait.

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,250
Thank them for me.

72
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,720
I'll pay for lunch later.

73
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,750
Don't forget about tonight.

74
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,350
Okay.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,670
Dr. Yan, over here.

76
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,920
Thanks, but I'm not thirsty.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,609
What kind of gift do you want to buy?

78
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:17,530
I don't know either. I'll just pick one according to your taste.

79
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,330
My taste?

80
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,129
I know what's on your mind.

81
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,320
But you don't have to do this.

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,849
I have to. He treats me very well.

83
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,939
If I don't do anything for him, I'll feel bad.

84
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,320
He?

85
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,819
My landlord.

86
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:37,719
He's such a gentleman.

87
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,669
I think you might have similar tastes.

88
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,609
So it won't be wrong to go with your taste.

89
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:45,819
Remember this. A gentleman doesn't like milk tea.

90
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,920
It's not for you.

91
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,509
Dr. Yan, what do you think about a fountain pen?

92
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,029
It's classic and practical.

93
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,570
Pretentious.

94
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,369
What about this?

95
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,939
It's black, chic, and low-key.

96
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,650
Whammy.

97
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,819
Superstitious.

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,229
What did you say?

99
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,130
I didn't say anything.

100
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,490
What about a necktie?

101
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,040
Tacky.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,210
Why are you wearing one, then?

103
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,819
Do you know what it means if you give a man a necktie?

104
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,530
In any case, it's not an appropriate gift based on the simple landlord and tenant relationship.

105
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,870
Why so?

106
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,810
Dr. Yan.

107
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,929
So you only give a necktie to someone you like.

108
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:46,110
That's pretty appropriate.

109
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,490
I said it's not appropriate.

110
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,230
Why?

111
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,130
Didn't you say he's an elite gentleman? Do you think he lacks neckties?

112
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,210
People under a lot of pressure like us mainly need to relax and release our stress.

113
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,160
Relax and release stress?

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,810
How do you do that?

115
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,430
Let me take this call first.

116
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,689
You bumped me!

117
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,209
Excuse me, Bro. There are surveillance cameras here.

118
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,169
- I don't care. You bumped me!
- I have to go now.

119
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,969
I didn't. You must be drunk.

120
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,350
You're so unreasonable.

121
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,549
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

122
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,909
No, I dodged.

123
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,140
He's drunk and trying to con me. Dr. Yan, let's get out of here.

124
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,209
Are you really okay? Tell me if you're hurt.

125
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,909
I'm fine. I managed to avoid him.

126

You bumped me!

127
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,480
What's wrong with him?

Is he okay?

129
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,890
Come on. Let's not get involved. Let's go.

130
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,160
He's lying on the floor to make a scene.

131
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,159
He went into shock from drinking alcohol.

132
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,050
I'll call the ambulance, then.

133
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,289
It's too late. Lend me a hand.

134
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,050
Careful.

135
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,569
I'll take him to the hospital first.

136
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,680
Be careful when you're on your way back.

137
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,250
In any case, a necktie is a "no."

138
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,259
Oh, no. I can't believe I have a crush on Dr. Yan.

139
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,900
Am I out of my mind or have nothing better to do?

After all, he's more than 80 years old.

143

He's a senior artist and also an excellent representative.

144
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,220
I think...

145

What's wrong with Tang Nuan?

146
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:58,779
Didn't you hear?

147

Director Sun is canceling Tang Nuan's program because of performance pressure.

148
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,540
Are you serious?

149
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,330
I thought her program had good ratings.

150
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,269
It's a pity that she doesn't have support at the TV station.

151
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:13,469
I know what you mean.

152

Enough talking. Let's get back to work.

Our communication will be smooth as well.

This way, please.

Why do we need such a big table when only the two of us are eating?

156
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,330
There won't be enough space for the food later.

157

You're doing this on purpose.

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,319
Uncle Song will be heartbroken if he sees you cry.

484
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,020
I'm okay.

485
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,590
Something came up at the office.

486
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,530
I have to go back now.

487
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,470
I should give her some space.

488
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,750
[One night]

489
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,109
- Dr. Yan.
- Who's there?

490
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:19,810
Dr. Yan, where's Director Su?

491
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,750
Didn't he come here just now? Isn't he with you?

492
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,099
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

493
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,690
You?

494
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,549
Since you've seen it, there's nothing to be shy about.

495
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,879
What is it? Why do you want to see me at this late hour?

496
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,289
I'm looking for Director Su.

497
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,500
Do you think he needs to hide if he's here?

498
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,519
No. I just thought he'd come to you for comfort

499
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,920
since he's in a difficult time.

500
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,530
What happened to him?

501
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,520
Don't you know about Director Su and Director Song's pictures?

502
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,400
What pictures?

503
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,950
No wonder you're calm.

504
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,219
Don't get agitated after you see them. Let Director Su explain it.

505
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,250
I'm certain these pictures were edited.

506
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,450
[Huateng's illicit affair. ]

507
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,410
The most problematic thing is

508
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,119
[Zao, I love "The CEO's Little Devil."]
that Huateng Land will force Mr. Su

509
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,499
to take full responsibility for the incident to save their reputation.

510
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:20,749
Geiger may have denied investing in Huateng.

511
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,790
But those keyboard warriors refuse to believe it and continue spreading rumors online.

512
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,810
Geiger's share price is still fluctuating.

513
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,200
The shareholders are not happy with Director Su because of this.

514
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,199
His position in Geiger Capital will be greatly affected.

515
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,289
You can rest assured when it comes to business.

516
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,350
It's a piece of cake for him.

517
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,750
You should worry about the consequences of infringement

518
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,100
of the right of reputation.

519
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,360
Zao.

520
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,520
[Zao, I love "The CEO's Little Devil."]

521
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,019
What are you talking about?

522
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:58,600
I... I don't understand.

523
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,810
Really?

524
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,819
"A pair of gold-rimmed glasses sitting on the tall nose bridge

525
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:08,600
highlighted the look of a refined rascal."

526
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,219
"A pair of slender hands that can skillfully handle a scalpel

527
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,199
stirred one's heart as he has mastered the skills to perfection."

528
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,889
"He is Yan Zhiyuan."

529
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:24,950
"That little devil whom people love and hate."

530
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,309
You're by Su Zhinian's side every day.

531
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,870
What's on your mind all the time?

532
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,290
Dr. Yan, please don't tell Director Su.

533
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,769
I'd do anything you ask if you don't tell Director Su.

534
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,010
Did you say "anything"?
