What are you doing here?

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,340
Nothing.

23
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,699
I just came to check on you.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,239
I'm worried that you might get rejected and have no shoulder to cry on.

25
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,699
Get out of here. I don't need a third wheel here.

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,739
Ungrateful rascal. I'm leaving.

The stats aren't improving.

It has started to decline day by day?

33

Once it drops to zero... It... It would...

It would... It would mean brain death?

I'll give you another chance.

Yes.

I like you.

I know that.

But you don't know I've had a crush on you

That's why you like soda drinks.

Do you know how unprofessional it is for you to do this?

113
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,289
If this gets out, no one will trust Geiger Capital's investments anymore.

In the past, I only cared about my work.

120

Now, I would always think

121

about waiting for you every day before and after work.

122
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,229
Over the weekends, I can accompany you to watch your favorite Korean series.

But whenever you called "Oppa," I'd be jealous.

Also, now I have someone to eat with me.

For the first time, I became interested in the crowded supermarket and home cooking.

127

Why did you bring me to my old house? The bank has already seized this house.

Don't be mad.

That's... That's because I've misunderstood you, then.

You already looked like a veteran cadre at 19 years old.

This was when the school took pictures of excellent graduates.

This photo is the only copy. They didn't give it to me.

There's a piano performance tomorrow. Don't be late.

162
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,470
I won't.

163
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,429
I like hearing you play the piano the most, so I won't be late.

164
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:57,910
Don't worry.

165
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,160
Why didn't you give it to me, then?

166
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,459
It's not that important.

167
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,090
How do you know whether it's important to me?

168
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,309
You didn't even tell me that you prepared the longevity noodles.

169
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:18,430
I thought it was Brother Yinan who made it for me.

170
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,980
"Best Dunker's Cup"

171
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,570
I remembered the trophy was...

172
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,469
He just temporarily left the arena of the American Professional Basketball League.

173
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,550
It's not that we'll never see him again.

174
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,960
But my youth has come to an end.

175
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,940
Also, I haven't gotten his signed jersey.

176
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,870
Don't cry. It's only a jersey. I'll figure it out.

177
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,599
- Really?
- Yes.

178
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,870
Thank you, Brother Yinan.

179
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,430
There, there.

184
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,169
You're awesome!

185
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:35,809
You really got it for me!

186
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,430
This...

187
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,229
Do you want to play basketball?

188
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:44,729
Sure! Let me put this away first.

189
00:20:44,729 --> 00:20:46,700
This is awesome!

190
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,370
What's wrong?

191
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,570
I missed Kobe.

192
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,260
He had formally said goodbye to this world.

193
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,799
Of course, not. Didn't you read what the netizens posted?

194
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,169
God wants to learn basketball, so he took Kobe away.

195
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,369
The legend of him still stands in another space and time.

196
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,620
Humans are too insignificant.

197

We'll never know if tomorrow or mishaps will come first.

198

Are you hungry?

199
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,329
I want to eat the noodles you cook.

200
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,989
Okay. I'll make it for you now.

201

Try and see if it tastes the same.

It's delicious. It tastes the same.

204
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Since you cooked noodles for me,

205

Answer the question on the age where you've landed.

00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,800
Age 32.

213
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,200
"What are you willing to do in exchange for?"

214
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,700
When I open my eyes every day,

215
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,200
I wish I could see you in front of me.

216
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,300
Sweet talker.

217
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,200
But don't you think there's something wrong with your sentence?

218
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,600
Shouldn't it be "I can see you every time

219
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
I open my eyes every morning?"

220
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,600
Isn't that so?

221
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,600
It's my turn.

"Do you fear the passage of time?"

224
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes.

225
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm scared I'll grow old and ugly.

226
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,700
But I'm more afraid

227
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,300
if you aren't by my side at that time.

228
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,200
So always remember that my marital status

229
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,000
can only be "widowed," not "divorced".

230
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,800
If you loathe me for being old and cheat on me with young women,

231
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,600
be ready to face the consequences.

232
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,700
No matter how old you are,

233
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,000
you will always look the same to me.

234
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,300
Your turn.

235
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,400
It's my turn now.

236
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
Age 79.

237
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,000
"If you or your partner had to leave this world first, who do you wish that would be?"

238
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
I may be more selfish.

239
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,800
I hope I'll go first.

240
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
If possible, I'd wish the same.

241
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,100
So I don't have to worry if you'll be sad when I'm no longer here.

I will.

326
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,500
As long as he's willing.

327
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,000
Did you just do your medical checkup?

328
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
A week ago.

329
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Be honest with me.

330
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,400
Is it bad?

331
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Or... Or did you find out

332
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,800
that we're actually half-siblings?

333
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,600
That's why you avoided me this afternoon.

334
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,900
You wanted to hire someone to play a heartless man, so I'll hate you and forget you.

335
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,200
If it's the second reason, we have no choice, then.

336
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,800
But if it's the first reason, no matter how bad it is, I still want to face it with you.

337
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
What do you think all day long?

338
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Don't deny it. That's how it goes in novels.

339
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm really okay.

340
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,700
Stop writing novels already.

341
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,600
If I have a disease, will you face everything with me?

342
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,800
Then are you willing to be my girlfriend?

343
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
Yes.

344
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,000

345
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,800
Is it fun to make fun of me?

346
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,000
I didn't make fun of you.

347
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,200
Cheng Qingcong!

348
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,100
I like you. I'm serious.

349
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,400
I know I'm a killjoy and not smart.

350
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,600
I can never tell if you're being serious... or just making a joke.

351
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,100
So can you think about it carefully before telling me anything next time?

352
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,700
Because I'll take it seriously.

353
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,300
I'm not joking.

354
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,700
I swear in the name of Hippocrates.
