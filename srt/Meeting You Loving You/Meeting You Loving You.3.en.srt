- Director Su.
- Song...?

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,569
So Director Su invests in Huateng Land

23
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,059
in return for you working for him.

24
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:17,599
What am I supposed to do if you're here as the assistant?

25
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,549
Oh, no. Am I jobless now?

26
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,159
Don't worry, the agreement is only for 100 days.

27

When the time is up, I'm not going to stay a minute longer.

It doesn't matter if I'm worried.

29
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,599
I'm worried about Dr. Yan.

Dr. Yan?

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,149
I have high expectations of Dr. Yan's medical skills.

I hope he can save my dad.

Do you think I should do something for Dr. Yan?

Do you know if there is anything he likes?

He likes...

Are you going to attend some kind of formal event later?

No, I'm going for an employee checkup at the hospital.

Otherwise, I'd want to study more from "Young Chic".

It was the keyboard warriors' fault for making your last streaming so awkward.

Director Su is a nice guy.

As an employer, his character and ability are definitely among the best.

- I knew you wouldn't understand.

00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,570
That's why I wrote down the order of the packages. You can just follow this order.

81
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,309
As long as you follow this order to deliver the packages, you won't exceed the time.

Thank you, Sister Cong. Nothing will go wrong if I listen to you.

- All right. Please wait for a moment.

Manager Qi, I don't know how did this happen.

97
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,680
The figure I got yesterday was 34.987%.

98
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,569
Accurately speaking, it should be 34.98731%.

Director Su, let's talk about this upstairs.

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,859
It's all thanks to Director Su, who cleared the matter. Manager Qi was the one who changed the figure.

102
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:20,639
He knew our boss thinks highly of my mental arithmetic and wanted to appoint me as his assistant.

103
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,989
That's why he was not happy about it and wanted to use this trick to kick me out of the company.

104
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:25,869
What happened after that?

105
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:28,179
I tendered my resignation after that.

106
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,159
I'm thankful and was impressed by Director Su.

107
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,809
When I knew he was looking for an assistant, I applied to work at Geiger.

108
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,339
That's because you're lucky to have met him while it was time for him

109
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,419
to reach his quota to accumulate good deeds.

110
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,909
You don't know him.

111
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,989
He's good at discovering the advantages and potential of others.

112
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:46,889
This is perhaps the reason his investment projects rarely fail.

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,979
Where did you go again?

114
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,429
If you forget to report to me next time,

115
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,100
I'll take it as a breach of our agreement.

116
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,780
What a great boss.

117
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,809
Hello, Miss Sofia. I'm the host for today, Tang Nuan.

118
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,100
I think we should just cancel for today.

119
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,669
Miss Sofia, is there a problem with the content of the interview?

120
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,939
I've confirmed the interview outline with you before.

121
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,699
Our main topic is about your experience in winning

122
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:53,039
the ANDAM Fashion Awards and your daily creations.

123
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,779
Is there anything that I've done wrong?

124
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,300
The fashion world knows my interview habits.

125
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,689
I especially emailed you what I'm wearing today

126
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,290
so that you could fit my style.

127
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,659
Look what you're wearing.

128
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:11,159
I'm sorry. It's my negligence.

129
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,399
But as you can see, the program will start recording soon.

130
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,429
Can you help us out here?

131
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,899
I thought "Young Chic" is a program that knows fashion best.

132
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,849
The host is unprofessional and didn't do any research.

133
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
I never make do with things.

Sofia. Sofia, I'm a fan of yours.

136
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,049
Since you joined Tiffany & Co.'s first spring collection,

137
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,159
I knew you'd win the award.

138
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,860
Spring collection?

139
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,499
Then you should know the collections

140
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,189
were no longer be sold the next day because of poor sales.

141
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:47,779
That's why Nuan Nuan and I especially bought a few at the time.

142
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,790
They are now limited worldwide.

143
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,010
Nuan Nuan, are you wearing these earrings

144
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,149
as a tribute to Sofia's spring collection's Monet's Garden?

145
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,669
- Yes.
- You sure put a lot of thought into it.

146
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:00,459
You must talk about Sofia's spring collections later.

147
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,609
This fashion legacy is something we can't forget those days.

148
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,180
Fine. You passed.

149
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,039
You must thank this fashionable and eloquent friend of yours.

150
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,760
Qingchun, thank you.

151
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,639
I was assigned to this program at the last minute. I haven't had the chance to tell you.

152
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,659
It's great that you're taking over the program.

153
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,579
By the way, I came to see you is because Brother Yinan is coming back.

154
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,030
I can't let him find out about my agreement with Su Zhinian.

155
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,209
So I want to put some of my toiletries at your place just in case.

156
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:40,639
Sure. The keys are in my bag in the dressing room.

157
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,959
- You can just take it.

I have a few questions to ask you.

290
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,379
- You can go after you answer me.
- What is it?

291
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:36,829
Do you know there are three don'ts in negotiation?

292
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,789
Firstly, don't be the one to give the first offer.

293
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:42,939
Here you are, offering a 300,000 yuan compensation to clients

294
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,490
who meet the refund policy.

295
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,439
If we don't bring up the compensation, they'll think we're not sincere.

296
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,179
All right. Let me ask you, then.

297
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:54,920
How did you come up with this amount?

298
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,290
I asked Zheng Hao to calculate it based on the fluctuation of the house market prices and inflation.

299
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,419
This should be a reasonable offer.

300
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,099
So is 300,000 yuan your limit?

301
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,590
Yes.

302
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,919
I mean, you can't make the offer first, not that you can't make an offer.

303
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,149
If you had to make the offer first,

304
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,410
you need to leave room for the other party to bargain.

305
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,279
You can't show them that 300,000 is the most you can offer, understand?

306
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:23,079
What about the other "Don'ts"?

307
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,559
Secondly, don't accept the other party's first offer

308
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,349
because the pleasure of transaction between two parties

309
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,879
is to have the amount greatly reduced. Let's say I'm the house owner.

310
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,439
I said 300,000 yuan wouldn't do, I want 400,000 yuan.

311
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,179
You can't accept that offer.

312
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,359
If you compromise so easily, the house owner will think you've taken great advantage of them.

313
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,080
This is human nature.

314
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,920

Do you know why Coca-Cola's price never increases and remain at three yuan?

342
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:16,279
Is this the additional question you had mentioned?

The peach flavor is not only three yuan.

344

Answer it seriously.

345
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,890
It's because the cost of production is low and the production volume is high.

- What else?
- And...

347

It's because Coca-Cola and Pepsi are the only two giant companies in this world.

348

If either raises the price, consumers will buy the other brand.

00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:08,550
They've officially invested in Huateng.

471
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,579
Director Su, I thank you on behalf of the Song family and Huateng Land.

472
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,329
Your last name isn't Song and you don't work at Huateng.

473
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,219
I don't think you're qualified to represent them.

474
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:25,100
Something is going on between Director Su and Director Qin.

475
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,990
Don't tell me...

476
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,329
I welcome Mr. Qin to the Legal Department on behalf of Huateng Land.

477
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:40,609
I look forward to your guidance from now on.

478
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:43,569
Sure, I look forward to yours too, Director Song.

479
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:44,970
Let's go.

480
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,320
By the way, how did you two get in touch?

481
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,479
Before this, I was worried that with Huateng Land's current situation, no company would want to help.

482
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:57,999
After what happened to my dad, his friend suggested Geiger to me.

483
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:01,660
I didn't expect it to be his company either.

484
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,340
It must be hard on you.

485
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:25,299
There was a mosquito, I'll ask the Logistics Department
to buy some mosquito repellent.

486
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,219
Brother Yinan, I'll ask the personnel of the Legal Department to show you the way there.

487
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:30,309
- You can come to me anytime if there are any issues.
- Okay.

488
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:32,260
- We'll have a welcome dinner tonight.
- It's my first day at work.

489
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,950
So I might be busy. Let's do it some other day.

490
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,030
You will have to treat me to a meal.

491
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,440
''Passing Through Your Memories'' - Zheng Guofeng

492
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,220
♫  In the end, I can only watch you  ♫

493
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:25,520
♫  walk towards happiness as I'm just a guest  ♫

494
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,610
♫  A love that I can't grasp  ♫

495
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:36,050
♫  Making promises I can't fulfill  ♫

496
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,040
♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

497
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,680
♫  The encounters we had  ♫

498
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:55,910
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart  ♫

499
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,960
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

500
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,440
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

501
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:13,980
♫  I'll continue to search by myself  ♫

502
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,759
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

503
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:22,710
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

504
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:29,230
♫  What can tear two hearts that beats as one  ♫

505
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:34,259
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

506
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:38,220
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

507
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:44,530
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

508
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:48,360
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

509
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,250
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

510
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:59,579
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

511
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,500
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

512
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:09,040
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

513
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,960
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
