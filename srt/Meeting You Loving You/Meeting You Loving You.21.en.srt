00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,790
Do you really think you can stop me so easily?

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,370
Of course not.

23
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,840
But I'd love to see what you have up your sleeves.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,460
I've hit the jackpot.

25
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,730
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialed is power off.

26
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,830
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialed...

27
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,160
Do you think you can scare me with just a few videos?

28
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,350
Of course not.

29
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,110
But if you agree, we can join hands.

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,310
Where is he?

31
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,490
Where is he now?

32
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,960
What? Do you want to take my life?

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,120
If that's the case,

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,750
all those videos

35
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,650
will be released to all video platforms.

36
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,000
Then, you will go viral on the internet

37

and be known by the entire world without spending a penny.

Everyone will know you are a monster.

39

You and Song Qingchun will meet your end.

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Are you exhausted?

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,210
So you can get tired too.

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,960
Don't bother resisting if you can't.

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,510
Just admit your defeat.

44
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,680
I'll order the men to stand down.

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,440
I was thinking if you insist on resisting

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,510
I would have to bring Song Qingchun here.

47
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,510
but I don't think you'll get the chance now

48

Stop right there!

50
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,700
Stop standing there.

51

Go after them.

52
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,560
- Let's go!
- Go get them!

53
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,730
Stop right there!

54
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,070
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,930
Go after them!

56
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,563
Yes.

57

Are you all right? Are you hurt?

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
Su Zhinian?

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,440
Su Zhinian, are you okay?

60
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,563
I'm fine.

61
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
We are being followed.

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,150
So... What should we do?

63
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,640
Do as I say. Keep driving. Take the freeway.

64
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,033
Sure.

65
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,830
Go east after the freeway.

66
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,800
It's more crowded with the traffic there.

67
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,550
We'll shake them off there.

68
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,580
I think we lost them.

69
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,423
Over here.

70
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,390
The car is on the roadside.

71
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,290
They couldn't have done far.

72

- Yes.

-Yes.

75
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,723
Yes.

76
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,483
What now?

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,310
Call the police.

78
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,100
No! They will take you.

79
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,080
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

80
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,120
I should call Yan Yuan.

81

- Hello?
 - Hello?

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,190
Su Zhinian!

What happened?

84
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,880
Chen Han somehow got wind of Su Zhinian's superpower.

85
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,390
His henchmen are pursuing us.

86
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,190
I also suspect he can track us using our phones.

87

Su Zhinian is not doing very well.

88

I'll ask my foreign friend to book a homestay with his ID.

By the way, tell Su Zhinian not to use his power again.

97

I'll find a way to meet you.

I didn't tell him though I found some problems.

You shouldn't take the risk with me.

Why isn't he here yet?

Hello, Miss Tang.

I am a fan of your show.

234
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm glad to share with you my memories from the early days.

235
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,400
Chen Han and I studied together since high school.

236
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,800
He was clever, but as an introvert,

237
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,600
he rarely hung out with us.

238
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
If there was anything strange about him,

239
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,900
it would be his frugal lifestyle despite studying in a private school.

240
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,800
Perhaps it was because of his upbringing.

241
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,600
Back then, we both got accepted into Stony Brook University.

242
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,700
But he never registered.

243
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,400
It was such a shame.

244
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
But I heard he's become very successful.

245
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
As his classmate, I am happy for him.

246
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
I knew he'd find success with his talent.

247
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Since you are going to interview him,

248
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,400

However, I don't think they know about Su Zhinian's power.

263

How should we proceed?

266

We still have the reporter.

269

270

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,800
Just come with me. Come on.

306
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600
No!

307
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,500
What if someone sees us?

308
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,400
Su Zhinian!

309
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,400
What are you doing?

310
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,600
I wasn't expecting that.

311
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,100
How did you do it?

312
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,800
A universal remote control.

313
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,300
IR signal has a range of 30 meters.

314
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,000
You're quite lucky.

315
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,400
But I can't see the subtitle.

316
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
It's not all about how long you go.

317
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,800
It's...

318
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,400
There was a connection, I thought.

319
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Of course, it's about how long it lasts.

320
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,000
But not everyone can be so fortunate.

321
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What do you mean?

322
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,700
Am I wrong?

323
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,400
When two people are in love, growing old together

324
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,000
is the greatest joy there is.

325
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
That's not what they mean.

326
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,800
What is it then?

327
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Recall the last scene.

328
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The last scene?

329
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Your translation wasn't accurate.

330

"Can you give me another first kiss?"

334
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
Sure.

335

337
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,900
I said, sure.

Song Qingchun?

I've known you for years, but I've never celebrated your birthday.

347

It's hideous.

348

351

Come back in one piece.

352
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
Director Chen, these are some questions for the interview.

353
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,800
Please have a look.

354
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,100
You seem very interested in my past.

355
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,700
It's not just me, the media industry is interested.

356
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,600
I wonder if I would have the honor of an exclusive interview?

357
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,400
Well, tell me what you want to know about me.

358
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,500
The first question.

359
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,400
What support and help did my family provide

360
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,400
when I started the business?

361
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Nothing at all. My parents passed away.

362
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,700
But I remember you once mentioned your mother was a great influence.

363
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,600
The purpose of my life is to fulfill my mother's dying wish.

364
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
Sorry.

365
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,200
So, what about your father?

366
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,500
He died over 14 years ago.

367
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,400
But I can tell you someone caused his death.

368
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
The culprit was none other than his elder brother,

369
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,300
who was also your best friend's father, Song Menghua.

370
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,000
Actually, I came back to avenge my family.

371
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,600
But as I remember,

372
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,100
Qingchun was the only child.

373
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,200
That's because I was the illegitimate child.

374
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
There.

375
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,600

Good boy.

378
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,400
Daddy is going to take us to the Song family later.

379
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Remember to behave yourself.

380
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,000
Your uncle lives there.

381
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,200
He is the closest family Daddy has.

382
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Daddy always listens to him.

383
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
So, make sure he likes you.

384
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Is that clear?

385
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,300
Yes.

386
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,400
What about you?

387
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,600
I'll be sure to visit you whenever I can.

388

Hello?

- Move aside!
- Who are you?

391
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,300
This is his son!

392

Please, I beg of you! Let me see him before it's too late.

- Please, I beg of you!
- Dad!

394

Mr. Song never told us he had a son.

395
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
Stop messing around, get lost!

396
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,800
I beg of you! This boy really is his son.

397
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,000
He promised me.

398
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,200
He promised to let my son into the family.

399

People can make up any story just for money.

400

He was having a vacation abroad with his wife before this.

Yes.

Please, let him see his father.

409
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600

- Chen Han! Your father is here!

414
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
When Song Zhongqian died,

415
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Song Menghua inherited his company shares.

416

Your father is inside!

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,900
And now, he has total control over the company.

418

Who knows if that was an accident?

419

He doesn't have a child.

420
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,400
Even if he did,

421
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,000
it's up to Song Menghua to decide whether the child is his.

422
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Remember the name Song Menghua.

423

He is the reason your father is dead.

424

I wouldn't mind the recording.

437
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,800
After all, I decide whether the episode will be aired.

438
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
My mother used to tell me this saying when I was a kid.

439
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,800
She told me the world would never take pity on the weak.

440
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,700
Only the powerful would be respected.

441

My men can't find her.

But since you two have been best friends for years, you know her the best.

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,000
For the first time ever, a branch of mathematics

500
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,900
is being applied to neurology.

501
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Honestly, there are many natural phenomenons

502
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,800
that we still cannot understand.

503
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,600
Technology is a door for humanity to reach breakthroughs and truth.

504
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,000
And this is also why I've been investing in technology.

505
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,200
Thank you, Director Chen.

506
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200

507

509
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,400
Su Zhinian!

510
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,500
Su Zhinian, wake up! We're in trouble.

511
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Su Zhinian?

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,500
''Passing Through Your Memories'' - Zheng Guofeng

513
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,200
♫  In the end, I can only watch you  ♫

514
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:53,000
♫  walk towards happiness as I'm just a guest  ♫

515
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,600
♫  A love that I can't grasp  ♫

516
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,800
♫  Making promises I can't fulfill  ♫

517
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,400
♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

518
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,600
♫  The encounters we had  ♫

519
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:23,100
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart  ♫

520
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,800
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

521
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,300
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

522
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:41,800
♫  I'll continue to search by myself  ♫

523
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,800
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

524
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,600
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

525
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,200
♫  What can tear two hearts that beats as one  ♫

526
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,000
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

527
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,200
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

528
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:12,400
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

529
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,200
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

530
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,200
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

531
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,500
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

532
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,400
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

533
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,300
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

534
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,900
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
