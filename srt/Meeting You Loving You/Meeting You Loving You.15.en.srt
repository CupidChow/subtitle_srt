[Episode 15]

20
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,370
Didn't you already apologize?

21
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,809
Besides, I'm the one who should apologize.

22
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,120
No matter what reason it is,

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,800
I still have...

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,250
Being drunk is not an excuse.

25
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,510
Have... Have what?

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,670
Let me ask you, apart from me, have you drunk alcohol with other people?

27
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,509
No.

28
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,910
Really?

29
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,940
Haven't you drunk with Director Yu?

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,039
On your birthday, that was the first and only time I drank alcohol.

31
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,259
Actually, I have low alcohol tolerance which is about two to three glasses.

32
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,940
Ever since then, I swore that I'd never drink anymore.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,140
Hold on.

34
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,019
Why do you suddenly want to drink?

35
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,450
It's such a big moment today.

36
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,760
Let's play a game to celebrate.

37
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,720
Titanic.

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,359
Two-thirds of the glass will be filled with beer.

39
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,240
Then, both of us

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,570
will take turns to pour wine into the "boat".

41
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,080
You can pour however much you want.

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
If the boat sink after one of us pours the beer,

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,010
that person will have to finish the whole glass.

44
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,639
- I don't drink.
- This game is simple.

45
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,290
It's about buoyant density.

46
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,919
What? A smart guy like you

47
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,300
is scared of losing to me who is bad at studying?

48
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,579
Forget it, I should just go to a bar with Cong Cong.

49
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,490
I heard that's where the real deals are.

50
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,150
I'll drink it with you.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,290
Don't regret it if you lose.

52
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,090
Let's start.

53
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,130
I'll go first.

54
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,290
Your turn.

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,249
- The boat sank.
- Yes.

56
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,850
It sank.

57
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,320
Drink up.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,980
Your turn.

59
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,060
It sank again.

60
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,549
I can't drink anymore.

61
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,150
- It's the last glass.
- Why is it just me?

62
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,099
This is the last one, drink up.

63
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,210
I can never outsmart you.

64
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,620
Who are you?

65
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,210
Why can't I hear you?

66
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,750
Because you are drunk.

67
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,520
No.

68
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,090
It's because

69
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,130
you are Song Qingchun.

70
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,720
You got it right.

71
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,020
I won't get it wrong.

72
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,820
Because you are the only one.

73
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,789
The first-order. The second-order. The third-order.

74
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:05,940
Indefinite.

75
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,419
It's getting closer indefinitely yet untouchable.

76
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,949
Do you know what's the biggest confusion about the difference method?

77
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,060
I don't care about the stability of our past.

78
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,960
I just want to know

79
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,670
if we will be related in the future.

80
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,139
I would also like to test you for the Granger causality.

81
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,980
I would like to know

82
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,430
if your existence explained time

83
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,870
or it's me who kept my promise.

84
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,300
You still insult my intelligence even after you are drunk.

85
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,860
Can you speak something that I could understand?

86
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,010
Su Zhinian.

87
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,910
Wake up.

88
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,039
- What are you doing?
- I'm feeling hot.

89
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,600
Could this be the reason

90
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
that he thought he did something to me?

91
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,219
Am I this unappealing that you fall asleep while kissing me?

92
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,600
I...

93
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,270
You jerk!

94
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm so mad!

95
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,300
How much did I drink last night?

96
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,010
You drank...

97
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,680
How much do you remember?

98
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,670
What was the last thing you remember?

99
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,189
- The boat sank.
- Yes, it sank.

100
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,940
What happened after that?

101
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,780
Were you feeling hot?

102
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,260
- And?
- What else?

103
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,940
You should rewatch Titanic and find out what happened when the boat sank.

104
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,059
Oh, right, difference method and the Granger causality test.

105
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:58,970
What are those?

106
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,120
I looked it up all night, I still don't get it.

107
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,879
Forget it.

108
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,759
You won't understand with your intelligence.

109
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,690
You should go.

110
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,429
Mind your own business, don't you ever drink with strangers.

111
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,670
Why did you run away from me yesterday?

112
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,350
Do you think...

113
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,590
You and your boyfriend...

114
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,999
Trust me.

115
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:54,419
From a man's perspective, your landlord is definitely not a good guy.

116
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,820
What does it have to do with me?

117
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,020
Why should I get upset?

118
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,900
You're here.

119
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,700
Let's start right away.

120
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,470
Your finger.

121
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,490
Why are you smiling?

122
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,760
Get your act together.

123
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,241
It's been four years before you finally cleared your name. What's there to be proud of?

124
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:26,110
Please control your expression.

125
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,510
We'll talk after the examination.

126
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,330
I know your love life hasn't been smooth-sailing.

127
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,489
But can you tone down your resentment?

128
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,070
Who is being resentful?

129
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,260
You fell for Cheng Qingcong?

130
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,229
- Who did?
- She's all you think about.

131
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:03,460
Yan Yuan, If you don't like her, leave her alone.

132
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,859
What do you mean? She should leave me alone.

133
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,109
Do you know? She described you and me as...

134
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,569
Never mind. Just shut up.

135
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,699
When was the last time you used your mind power?

136
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm asking you.

137
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,559
When was the last time you used your mind power?

138
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,960
What's wrong with you?

139
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,700
Two days ago.

140
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,989
But I regained my consciousness after about 10 hours.

141
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,930
10 hours? How is that possible?

142
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,070
The longest time you lost your consciousness was only four hours.

143
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,980
Maybe it was an accident.

144
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,630
Something's wrong with the examination data.

145
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,820
But I'm still not sure what's exactly the problem.

146
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,439
Anyhow, you can't use your superpower for now.

147
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,730
I will send the data to the research institute and conduct a meeting based on your situation.

148
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,239
Come up with the surgery procedure.

149
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,369
Also, if you experience headaches again during this period, you must tell me.

150
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,880
If necessary, you'll have to go abroad to get treated.

151
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,639
Or your brain wouldn't be able to handle such strong mind power.

152
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,680
It will collapse completely.

153
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,660
- What happens then?
- What happens then?

154
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,890
Take a guess.

155
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,070
You will die.

156
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,019
All right then, take care of yourself.

157
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,670
Have you been busy lately?

158
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,490
No wonder you are not updating your novel.

159
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,870
Are you lacking some inspiration in your writing?

160
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,940
What are you trying to do?

161
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,239
I will give you some actual ideas.

162
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,689
I'm telling you! I'm not an unfaithful woman who would cheat on my boyfriend!

163
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,490
Just you wait.

164
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,990
Are you hungry?

165
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,490
There's something

166
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,910
I've wanted to ask but I don't know how.

167
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,480
Well, it hasn't been that long.

168
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,320
I just found out about it last night.

169
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
Last night?

170
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,670
Let me ask you.

171
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,120
Are you feeling guilty about me because you thought

172
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,890
you did something to me?

173
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,350
Wh... What do you mean?

174
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,830
Well...

175
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,799
To be honest, you didn't do anything to me that night.

176
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,860
I hate you because I thought you tried to do something.

177
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,639
Anyway, you do get drunk really easily.

178
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,560
You sleep naked and you are clingy.

179
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,090
Unbelievable.

180
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,250
What are you staring at? Keep driving.

181
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,960
Stop!

182
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,500
You are something else. I can't believe you drove over the curb.

183
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,890
What do we do now?

184
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,799
What else? I'll call for a tow truck.

185
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,649
Hello? Hi.

186
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,549
I need towing service now, we are at the west section of Hupan Road.

187
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,570
Okay. Thank you.

188
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,110
They'll need 20 minutes to arrive.

189
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,250
I... I'm starving.

190
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,749
What do you want to eat? I'll order delivery.

191
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:22,560
Delivery? To this spot?

192
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,710
Let's try.

193
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,660
All right.

194
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,229
Beer and barbeque, the essential combination in summer.

195
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,710
No, you alcoholic.

196
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,479
You are not driving anyway, just a few sips won't hurt.

197
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:42,890
Aren't you worried that I might get drunk and take off my clothes?

198
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,359
So what?

199
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm not the one who would be on the trending topic.

200
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,759
I'm telling you, this is a rare chance.

201
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,730
You are no fun at all.

202
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,610
Nice.

203
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,660
These are non-spicy ones.

204
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,490
The moon is beautiful tonight.

205
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,670
Don't say that when you are with other guys.

206
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,000
Why?

207
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,600
Do you know the Japanese author, Natsume Soseki?

208
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,199
He translated "I love you" into "The moon is beautiful tonight".

209
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,300
When did you become a hipster now?

210
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,580
Because the moon is beautiful tonight

211
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,010
and I just want to share it with you.

212
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,730
You're illiterate.

213
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,369
I... I'm illiterate?

214
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:38,529
Then do you know how do you say enoki mushroom?

215
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:40,560
Enoki mushroom.

216
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
You're illiterate.

217
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,160
It's "see you tomorrow".

218
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,550
Gosh. Why did I eat so much?

219
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,330
What are you doing here?

220
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,519
- To take a shower.
- Here?

221
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,690
The bathroom upstairs is not working.

222
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,610
Mop the floor after you are done.

223
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,670
You...

224
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,139
You... What are you looking at?

225
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,560
Why is your face flushing?

226
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,480
I... It's my allergic reaction after drinking too much.

227
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,780
Why do you keep staring at me?

228
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,689
Who is staring at you? I'm watching TV.

229
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,900
Why are you watching Titanic?

230
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,200
Classics can never be replicated.

231
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll help you remember.

232
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,300
Do you remember how many times you have watched this movie?

233
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't remember.

234
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you remember what they did after the cruise ship sank?

235
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
From what I can recall, Rose kissed Jack.

236
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,700
Why do I think it's Jack who kissed Rose?

237
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,800
My throat feels itchy.

238
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,600
Can you get me a Coke?

239
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
Thank you.

240
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
Thank you.

241
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,000
Why are you watching another movie?

242
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't feel like watching a tragedy.

243
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Get me another flavor.

244
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't want to drink this anymore.

245
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
Please.

246
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,600
This should be safe.

247
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Why are you watching animation now?

248
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,000
It's late night. Let's watch something fun.

249
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's good for our health.

250
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
- I...
- Are you going to get another can?

251
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,900
Don't be shy. It's just a kiss.

252
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,200
Besides, there's no more Coke in the fridge.

253
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,300
Or... Would you like some soda water?

254
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,900
Who is getting shy?

255
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,000
Do I look like I'm getting shy?

256
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,800
It's just a kiss. What's so embarrassing about it? Right?

257
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Am I right?

258
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Am I right? Right?

259
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,000
Young man. You should stop watching so much of these indecent shows.

260
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,800
You wish to acquire Yangguang Capital

261
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,800
so that you can approach Qingchun as an investor.

262
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
It is a good idea.

263
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,600
But for what I know,

264
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,500
Yangguang Capital and Huateng have come to an agreement regarding the contract.

265
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,600
What's left is signing the contract.

266
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,000
Even if you act up and refuse to sign, they are just going to get another investor.

267
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,600
Many are trying to invest.

268
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,300
That's why I need your help.

269
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,500
Do something on the contract.

270
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,800
Besides, this is not your first time.

271
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,000
It should be easy.

272
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Director Chen. What are you implying?

273
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Calm down.

274
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,800
What do you think about my tie color? It's the latest design.

275
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
Have some water. Here.

276
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,400
You're back.

277
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
What did you make this time?

278
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
Try this.

279
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
Why do you come home so late recently?

280
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm busy. What about you? Why didn't you go for the shooting?

281
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
They removed my show.

282
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,800
They want me back on Young Chic as the host.

283
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,600
Isn't that great? Your previous work was too demanding.

284
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,800
You won't have to go out of town for work anymore.

285
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,600
But I want to do my own show.

286
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,700
If you really don't like it, you can just quit.

287
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
I can take care of you.

288
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,800
I don't want to quit.

289
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,200
Yinan. Can you talk to the company for me?

290
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,000
The TV station has been trying to get sponsors from Huateng and Geiger.

291
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Who do you expect me to talk to?

292
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
You can't do that?

293
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,200
Su Zhinian or Song Qingchun?

294
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,200
You are just worried about your pride.

295
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,600
You quit your job and came back for Song Qingchun.

296
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,600
But you refused to do me a small favor now.

297
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,100
Qin Yinan.

298
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,800
Do you really care for me?

299
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,600
In the end, she's the one you—

300
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,800
Can you stop mentioning her every single time? What's the point?

301
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,000
Yes.

302
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
It's pointless indeed.

303
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
[Huateng Land Co., Ltd.]

304
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,500
See you at 7 PM at Jiangli International I have something to tell you.

305
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,100
Also, I asked Legend Su to let you off early.

306
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,500
You are not working overtime.

307
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,400
What do I do?

308
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,200
I can't control myself anymore.

309
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,800
Cong Cong, what's wrong?

310
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Director Song.

311
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Are you free now?

312
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,200
I need to talk to you.

313
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Of course. Director Su is not here anyway.

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Come here.

315
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Here. Have a seat.

316
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,900
Tell me. Why do you want to talk to me?

317
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,500
Just say it. There's nobody here.

318
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
It's a friend of mine.

319
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,400
She thinks that her boss's best buddy has a girlfriend.

320
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,800
But one day,

321
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,300
that boss's friend just kissed her and wouldn't leave her alone.

322
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,600
Director Song.

323
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,800
Who do you think the boss's friend actually likes?

324
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Do you have to ask? He's obviously two-timing.

325
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,200
That friend of yours.

326
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,100
Is it you?

327
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,300
You said it is your boss's best buddy.

328
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,000
- Yan Yuan is such a terrible person?
- How did you know it was me?

329
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,200
He's not that bad.

330
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I just think that I've been shipping a fake couple.

331
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,600
Wait.

332
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,800
You said Yan Yuan kissed you?

333
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,400
What else did he do to you?

334
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,100
No, he didn't.

335
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,500
I will send you a list later. Get all the things on the list.

336
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,000
If he touches you again, just teach him a lesson.

337
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,900
Hold on a second. You like Yan Yuan, don't you?

338
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,200
Did he tell you anything?

339
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,400
He used to say that he doesn't like someone immature like me.

340
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,600
These men. Don't listen to him.

341
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,300
You are just...

342
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,100
You just don't know how to do your makeup.

343
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Trust me.

344
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,800
I will make you the star of the night.

345
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,000
Really?

346
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,300
Get up. Let me take a look at you.

347
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,700
Look at your face and your figure.

348
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
You are a natural beauty.

349
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Tonight...

350
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,400
What are you two doing?

351
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,900
Director Su.

352
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,700
It's between us women. Leave us alone.

353
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,900
Press your lips.

354
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Perfect.

355
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,000
Let's go.

356
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,400
Come on.

357
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,200
Drink up.

358
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Cheers.

359
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,410
What's wrong? You don't like it?

360
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,250
Just say it if you don't like it, It's fine.

361
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,579
Women dress up not for others, but for themselves.

362
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:25,170
It's most important that you like it.

363
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,100
I like it a lot.

364
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,660
But I'm worried that someone I know might see me dressing up like this.

365
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,119
You look gorgeous, don't be shy.

366
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,029
Now, you can even stop wearing those boring office wear to show your professionalism.

367
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,900
People respect and trust you because of your capabilities.

368
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,550
I just realized this myself not long ago.

369
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,729
- It's fine.
- Relax.

370
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,829
- I...
- You look beautiful.

371
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,190
Look, confidence

372
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,790
is a woman's biggest charm.

373
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,240
Let's go.

374
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,250
Are you ready?

375
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,610
Put your hands up!

376
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,649
Hello, gorgeous. Can I talk to you?

377
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,290
I've noticed you for some time.

378
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,850
I... I have to go soon.

379
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:44,559
Do you need a ride? I have a sports car.

380
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,829
She has a car. No, thank you.

381
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,339
- Are you hungry?
- I got hungry after dancing.

382
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,490
- Let's eat more.
- Your food is here, enjoy.

383
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,170
Thank you.

384
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,770
Wait, don't rush when the food is here.

385
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,420
Let's take a selfie first.

386
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,189
- Come on, give me your phone.
- All right.

387
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,510

388

389
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,370
Okay.

00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,619
Hold on. Post it out.

It's done.

393
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,740
She can drink so much?

394
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,800
- Hello?
- Hey.

395
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,949
- Did you see the post? 
- I saw it. What's wrong?

396
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,670
I sent the address to you.

397
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,349
If they keep drinking like that, they are going to get wasted.

398
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:18,400
Take your woman home.

399
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,120
My woman?

400
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,420

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,359
Enough... Stop drinking.

404
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,500
This is your third glass.

405
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,049
Director Song, You know what?

406
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:44,189
Not only does Dr. Yan has a close boyfriend like Director Su...

407
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,760
Guy friend.

408
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,920
Yes.

Their relationship is as pure as snow.

Anyway, he is a jerk.

Let's eat. Keep eating.

419

He doesn't like me.

420
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,629
But he keeps messing with me and even flirts with me.

421
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,919
He... He even forced a kiss on me. Like this.

422
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,160
- Cong Cong.
- Let me tell you.

423
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,300
His kissing skills are terrible!

424
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,420
Your kissing skills are terrible.

You jerk. Why are you so late?

All right.

436
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,070
Don't worry. Yan Yuan wouldn't do anything to her.

437
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,130
Of course, you would vouch for him.

438
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,100
You got him to come here?

439

To help Cong Cong find out what Yan Yuan is thinking.

Do you want to continue drinking?

- I'll drink with you.
- No way.

I'm still worried about Cong Cong.

00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,090
Don't worry. I've known Yan Yuan for so long.

447
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,919
But that was my first time seeing him lose his cool.

448
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,740
Maybe it's because of his family, he's not good at handling intimate relationships.

00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,280
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

493
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,200
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

494
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,500
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

495
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,420
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

496
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:52,990
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

497
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,480
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
