There are no driving restrictions today.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,649
You were drunk and threw up in my car last night.

22
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,890
The cleaning fee will be deducted from your salary this month.

23
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,500
I threw up?

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm so sorry. I blacked out.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,810
Do you really don't remember anything?

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,680
Can't recall anything?

27
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,810
Did I make a mess in the house? I didn't.

28
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,229
It seemed fine to me just now.

29
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,229
Song Qingchun, what is wrong with you?

30
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,789
You're an adult.

31
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,910
You blacked out after having some wine.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,010
How dare you fool around out there?

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,779
Are you throwing tantrums now?

34
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:25,800
Look who's talking. You, too, blacked out after drinking, didn't you?

[Huateng Land]

36
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,139
This idea of mine originated from the attempt

[Dahua Qinghu]
of "Dahua Xiyou" 's offline theme store.

38
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,579
In recent years, they have cooperated with convenience stores,

39
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,459
Internet cafes, and fast food brands.

40
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,209
It not only enriches the player experience but also injects new vitality

41
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,829
into the traditional industry through the crossover.

42
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,949
- So I was thinking...
- Oh, no.

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,109
The proposal on the ancient town will surely be thrown out.

44
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,019
I have the feeling that Director Song will get it from Director Su again.

45
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,300
It has a stable user base and staying ability.

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,459
That's right. This proposal is way too subjective.

47
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,700
The early-stage data and reasoning are very uncertain.

48
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,150
I believe it can break the dimensional barriers...

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,150
My goddess's proposal is brilliant.

50
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,010
Fanboy. You'd better figure out how to take the bullet for your goddess.

51
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,829
Increase customer retention rate.

52
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,299
That concludes my preliminary idea.

53
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,700
I hope this can help to add value to the proposal.

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,839
Let's brainstorm together and provide more valuable suggestions.

55
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,819
You use the method of intellectual property development to develop commercial land.

56
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,159
Director Song, that's very imaginative. I'm impressed.

57
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,929
But the underlying data of the population

58
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,110
covered by the Qinghu area, et cetera.

59
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,729
So the next step is to continue to consolidate research data.

60
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:59,820
We'll discuss further on this.

61
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,749
That's all for today. The meeting ends here.

62

Have you heard?

63
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,009
Director Qin has won the lawsuit against Qianxi and helped us recover the debt.

64
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,219
Director Qin is really something.

65
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,540
The owner of Qianxi is a renowned deadbeat.

66
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,739
Also, I heard that he would retaliate against lawyers who helped recover debts.

67
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,939
Director Qin is no ordinary lawyer.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,129
He's a man that I fancy.

69
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:34,939
You fancy him?

70
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,209
Director Qin is an outstanding man. So many girls are after him.

71
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,229
Girls who want to be his girlfriend

72
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,320
will have to be someone really outstanding.

73
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,720
Director Song, what's wrong?

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,820
Nothing.

75
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,529
Director Su commented on the issue with the data because he wants you to improve.

76
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,610
He didn't mean to criticize you.

77
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,939
Why don't I get you another can of coffee?

Director Qin said he would drop by your office at two and asked you to make yourself available.

If he comes, tell him that I've gone out for fieldwork.

Director Su, what do you want me to do?

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,509
Well... Usually, when you're in a bad mood, how do you deal with it?

93
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,469
It's determined on a case-by-case basis.

94
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,709
Sometimes, a round of hotpot will do it.

95
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,149
Sometimes, it takes at least two rounds.

96
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,690
For instance?

97
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,130
Heartbroken, for instance.

98
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,629
To me, this question is a little beyond the scope of my knowledge.

99
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,329
But based on my experience of watching Korean dramas and reading online forums,

100
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,379
an amusement park is a good choice.

101
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,469
The outdoor has an open space.

102
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,469
One can ride a roller coaster to scream and vent,

ride a carousel to conjure up childhood memories,

and have a romantic atmosphere by riding the Ferris wheel.

105
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,469
There are plenty of options to pick from.

106
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,719
Besides, the set meal at Happy Valley is awesome.

107
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,579
If you buy a couple set meal, you'll get a little gift as well.

108

Who says I'm going?

109
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,059
Cut down the time spent on watching Korean dramas.

110
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,469
You pin your emotions on others.

111
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,880
Such emotional investment that violates the basic principle of return

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,939
will only draw people into nihilism.

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,939
That's not emotional sustenance and nihilism.

114
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,379
It's called copying others' work.

115

There are thousands of blood vessels connected to the heart.

116

Emulating the method used in one's relationship can help one

find a better way to get to another person's heart.

118

Personal limitations are the power of big data.

119
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,709
You said that yourself.

120

Director Su, look. You're a capable guy.

121

Still, you have no idea how to cheer a person up.

123
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,589
Very well, tell Director Song to get ready

124
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,379
and conduct big data research with me.

125

The amusement park is one of the first real estate projects with intellectual property awareness.

Good brands continue to flourish.

Are you going to ride the carousel with the kids in that outfit?

You look like a freakish lady.

140

Pretty girl, it's indeed not good for you to wear this. Why don't you come and have a look?

141

We have discount promotions. A t-shirt like this is just perfect.

Buy one. It suits you.

Who wants that?

Don't say I didn't tell you the key point.

148
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,800
Marketing strategy matters too.

149
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,870
That's right. We're having an in-store promotion. Buy one and get one couple shirt for free.

150
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,379
Besides, you get to pick one headwear.

Okay, I'll scan the bar code.

00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,850
This suits you too!

158
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,139
Director Su, speaking of the key point, we should take a closer look.

159
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
I believe you won't mind.

160
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,600
Your girlfriend is so funny.

You two make a good match.

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
It's done.

163
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,200
Now the inspection officially begins.

164
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,000
The first segment teaches you how to stand firm with your opponents in the competition.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Are you ready?

166
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,900
Su Zhinian. You're really something.

167
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,000
Bring it on. I'm not afraid of you.

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
♫  Hey, you've made a wish to the shooting star  ♫

169
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,000
♫  I don't see you have any ideas  ♫

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,600
♫  Obviously you don't have a good appetite lately  ♫

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
Don't mess with me.

172

♫  I couldn't say what I wanted to say to you  ♫

173
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800

174

♫  Is there still time to rewrite the script?  ♫

175

♫  I guess the fireworks will light the path in front of you  ♫

176
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,000

♫  Is the happiest failure  ♫

183

♫  I want to meet you among the crowds  ♫

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Su Zhinian!

186
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,800
♫  I'll give up fighting  ♫

187
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,400
Yinan.

188
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,800
This calls for a celebration.

189
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,700
Here. Have some tea.

190
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,400
You just took over and managed to crack this tough nut, Qianxi.

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Awesome! How impressive!

192
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Vice President Li, just tell Secretary Chen to inform me if you have things to discuss.

193
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
I could just drop by your office.

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
It saves you all the trouble.

195
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,500
Back when you were still studying,

196
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,700
I remember telling your dad that you were a smart kid

197
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,400
and that you'd get somewhere someday.

198
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Look. I was right, wasn't I?

199
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,400
But anyhow, we're the veterans of Huateng.

200
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,800
Now, there's this Su Zhinian in the picture.

201
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,200
This makes me feel uneasy.

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I hope however things pan out,

203
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,700
you will stand on my side.

204
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,100
The reason I came back is to stand by Huateng

205
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,200
and Qingchun.

206
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,300
Besides,

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
thanks to you for thinking so highly of me.

208
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,000
But I can only help to keep close tabs on the company's legal affairs.

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm still quite a distance away from the core business.

210
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,200
I'm afraid I might not be of any help to you.

211
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,900
I have things to do. I shall take my leave.

212
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,900
Okay. Take care.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
He put on quite a show.

214
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,900
Just like his father.

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Where's Director Song?

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
Director Qin.

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Director Song has gone out for fieldwork with Director Su.

218
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,600
Didn't you tell her that I have things to discuss with her?

219
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
I did.

220
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,500
Perhaps, Director Su's situation requires urgent attention.

221
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,000
If it's urgent, you can give her a call.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Okay.

223
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
Tell her I was here when she returns.

224
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Thank you.

225
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Director Su, are you happy now?

226
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
We've done browsing the merchandise and the park.

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,100
Should we get off work already?

228
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,700
Weren't you so full of energy this morning?

229
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,900
That was during work. It's past working hours now.

230
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,800
Too bad.

231
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm afraid you have to accommodate my schedule and work overtime.

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,500
Article 9 of the contract stipulates that Party B must accommodate

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,800
to Party A's working hours unconditionally.

234
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,700
Besides using the contract to threaten me, don't you have some other tricks?

235
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,800
If it can solve the problem quickly and right to the point,

236
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,100
why should I waste more time and effort?

237
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,000
You unscrupulous businessman!

238
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
My goodness!

239
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,700
The new release of Dahua Xiyou's Little Fox Demon of Myriad Forms mystery boxes!

240
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,000
First and second rank, charmingly naive. Third and fourth rank are cute series.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
The fifth rank is girly style.

242
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,600
The best one is this, the Golden Hidden Series!

243
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,100
Why are you acting like a live stream host who's reading from the script?

244
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,400
What do you know? Move.

245
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
[Golden Hidden Series]

246
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,000
Hidden series. Hidden series.

247
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
[Thank you for your patronage]

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Another one.

249
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,700
Hidden series.

250
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Is this the one you're dying to get?

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,300
Who doesn't want the hidden series?

252
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,700
It's not impossible.

253
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,600
If I can get the Golden Hidden Series of this Little Fox Demon,

254
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,500
promise me that you'll stay.

255
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,400
Do it if you can.

256
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,300
The Golden Hidden Series!

257
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Are you happy now?

258
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,900
Yes. Quite happy.

259
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Director Su, what's the request?

260
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
Just name it.

261
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
For starters, put this on.

262
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,500
How's this, Director Su?

263
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
Not bad.

264
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,700
How was it? Exciting?

265
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,099
This is what you called exciting?

266
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,400
Director Su. Is this you chickening out right the next minute you manned up?

267
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,500
A successful manager will keep the rhythms in check.

268
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,900
He'll define "excitement" to stay on a stable track.

269
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,100
Thank you for giving me yet another lesson.

270
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,600
Well, can we get off the stable track now?

271
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,400
Have your eyes wide open and take a good look at the world.

272
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
This is what's called excitement.

273
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
Director Su.

274
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
Are you up for it?

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,700
I bet you must be scared.

276
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,800
All the talk about the stable track

277
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,000
and manning up.

278
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,300
The real excitement is to overcome one's weaknesses.

279
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
That's my definition of excitement.

280
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,700
Let's go, then.

281
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
How are you holding up?

282
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
Here. Have some water.

283
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
Look at you.

284
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Don't force yourself if you're afraid of height.

285
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,400
You just had to give me all the crap talk.

286
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Good thing you didn't vomit up there.

287
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,700
If you did, those in the back rows would have to suffer.

288
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,800
Now you know why I don't take the back row?

289
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I realize your brain works in a funny way.

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
Are you not right in the head?

291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
I might not be right in the head.

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Nothing beats you taking so many rounds of roller coaster rides.

293
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,700
All right. What do you want to play?

294
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
I'll keep you company.

295
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,500
I won't bully you. All right?

296
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,910
Sorry.

297
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,269
How about playing this?

298
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:50,070
[Be careful of getting wet]

299
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,130
I'll have one of this color.

300
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,400
Here. I'll tie it up for you.

301

- Come on.

302
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,399
- Where are we having our dinner?
- I'll take you to a famous restaurant on the internet.

303
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,490
The balloon will fly away.

304
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,510
But there'll be one that belongs to you.

305
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,570
No matter what, it's not going anywhere.

306

Thank you for today.

307
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,909
Actually, I should be the one thanking you.

308
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,049
If you hadn't dragged me out here for fieldwork,

309
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:39,499
I had no idea how to face Brother Yinan in the afternoon.

310
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:45,449
Be it a relationship or work, running away is never a good choice.

311
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,189
Everyone understands that.

312
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,209
But life is much more specific and complicated than that.

313
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,650
When I was a kid, my dad was very busy with work.

314
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,839
Over the weekends, during the winter and summer vacations,

315
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,099
I would follow Brother Yinan around like his little follower.

316
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:03,759
On my birthdays, he would cook longevity noodles for me.

317
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,669
I love Kobe. Back then, he was just a poor student.

318
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,100
But he would find ways to get me Kobe autographed jersey.

319
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,190
I always thought

320
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,440
he was someone who knew me best.

321
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,160
Well, do you really know him well?

322

But from the looks of it,

324
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,680
I was making a fool of myself.

325
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,330
So many years of being together.

326
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,710
It can't be taken back just like that.

327
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,530
You think I'm quite foolish, don't you?

328
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,359
If so, I'm more foolish than you, aren't I?

329
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,460
Happy birthday, Qingchun.

330
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,570
Thank you, Brother Yinan.

331
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,990
[To Song Qing Chun, Happy Birthday]
A birthday gift that I can't give

332
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,790
and my mistaken intention

333
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,449
- How did you get this?
- You're awesome!

334
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,070
You got it!

335
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,290
I've liked Brother Yinan since I was 17.

336
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,299
When he smiled at me, I would feel like my whole world had brightened up.

337
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,560
That feeling constantly reminded me

338
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,060
that it was love.

339
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,470
I get it.

340
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,669
Do you really understand?

341
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,230
Even if he has a girlfriend now,

342
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,539
I still can't stop myself from liking him.

343
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,570
It's hard to be honest with yourself.

344
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,089
There is nothing to be ashamed of if you're able to confront your desires.

345
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,140
That's right.

346
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,170
Denying my feelings for him

347
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,090
is like denying my entire youth.

348
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,970
That's the typical sunk cost effect.

349
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,740
Sunk cost refers to a cost that has already occurred

350
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,709
and has no potential for recovery.

351
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,150
People don't want to give up because of the efforts they've invested.

352
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,539
But in fact, stopping loss in a timely manner is the best choice.

353
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,989
But love is not economics.

354
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,500
To love is a natural instinct.

355
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,349
What do we do? Our progress is only at about one-tenth of our deal.

356
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,260
But you seem to already know a lot of my secrets.

357
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,270
That's right. Come over.

358
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,540
Let me tell you a secret as well.

359
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,669
Hey, I'm at your place now.

360
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,530
- Where did you go?
- When I get back...

361
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,669
When I get back, I'll change my door code.

362
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,599
Cut the crap. Hurry back, Call Song Qingchun along. Something urgent came up.

363
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,449
Come on, Yan Yuan has something important to discuss.

364
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,470
He's already waiting at home.

365
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,849
Su Zhinian. What was the secret that you wanted to tell me?

366
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,949
- Tell me.
- I'll tell you next time.

367
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:30,720
No! I have a strong curiosity!

368
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,630
Dr. Yan.

369
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,030
Is there something wrong with my dad?

370
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,400
Uncle Song's condition is quite tricky.

371
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,389
But there's still a glimmer of hope.

372
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:50,199
Dr. Yan, Please. You have to save my dad.

373
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,539
Don't worry.

374
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,680
I came here today because I have a bold idea

375
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,629
and it requires his family member's opinion.

376
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,600
What do you need me to do? Just tell me.

377
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,049
Here's the thing.

378
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,850
I want to track your body's metrics

379
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,189
and combine it with your dad's current condition

380
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,430
to find a new treatment method.

381
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,040
My body's metrics?

382
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,440
This is my first time hearing such a method.

383
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,900
Does it really work?

384
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,639
If you won't tell me the details about this superpower shield,

385
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:24,709
I can study it myself.

386
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,390
In your dreams.

387
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,370
What's the matter with you?

388
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,249
Miss Song, this isn't a groundless claim.

389
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:39,229
The American Journal of Behavioral Psychology

390
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,439
did a study to track and observe dozens of pairs of father, daughter, and son.

391
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:49,749
Through MRI brain scans, they found out that when the daughter is happy,

392
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:52,100
the father has a greater response in the brain regions

393
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,670
associated with reward and emotional regulation.

394
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,299
When the son is happy, the response in these regions is average.

395
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:04,239
In other words, the father's brain produces a strong sense of pleasure

396
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,850
when his daughter is happy.

397
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,169
- Do you get it?
- So you want me

398
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:10,879
to move to the hospital to live with my dad

399
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:13,089
to make it more convenient for your research and monitoring. Right?

400
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:16,750
Su Zhinian, If you won't work with me, I'll make her move out.

401
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,610
I'll pack my things and move at once.

402
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,470
Don't you dare mess around.

403
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,189
Su Zhinian, what are you doing?

404
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:25,189
That's right. What are you doing?

405
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,470
Dr. Yan, why don't we talk outside?

406
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,090
It's okay.

407
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,189
Just put on this bracelet and make sure it's power on.

408
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,549
It will automatically upload the monitoring data to me every day.

409
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,120
Okay.

410
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,600
We have something personal to discuss upstairs.

411
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Be sure to put it on.

412
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,710
What are you doing?

413
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,540
They're acting strange.

414
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,640
What is it?

415
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,650
Song Qingchun is still down there. You...

416
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,210
- What's the matter?
- Can you stop messing around?

417
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,259
I'm not.

418
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,639
Are you not curious as to why she's able to shield you from your superpower?

419
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:19,690
- Not interested.
- You've done so much for her

420
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,450
and you might not seek anything in return.

421
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,079
But as your buddy, I won't miss out on any possibility of getting you cured.

422
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,269
If she can help to get rid of the problems that have been troubling you all these years,

423
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,250
it doesn't matter even if you cut ties with me.

424
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,090
You don't get it.

425
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,589
All these years, my superpower has perplexed me
for a really long time.

426
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:43,099
But when I found out that I couldn't hear her thoughts,

427
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:45,539
instead of feeling surprised, I was frustrated.

428
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,969
Frustrated that I could hear everyone's thoughts,

429
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:51,389
but I could never seem to know what she was thinking.

430
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,230
Otherwise,

431
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,169
- our misunderstanding wouldn't have lasted for so many years.
- What do you mean?

432
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:01,229
I just learned today that she fell in love with Qin Yinan

433
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,600
because she thought he was the one who did those things for her.

434
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,600
That's so absurd.

435
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,169
So he had been reaping the benefits of all the things that you did for Song Qingchun?

436
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:15,440
Go and tell her that.

437
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,950
Her feelings for Qin Yinan are real.

438
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,529
I don't want her to deny her past because of this.

439
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,950
Besides, it was never her guilt that I wanted.

440
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,539
Since what made her fall in love

441
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,050
was the things that I'd done, right now,

442
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,300
I can make her fall for me again.

443
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,970
But there's such a misunderstanding between you two.

444
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,790
I'm afraid there's no going back to the sweet innocence of youth.

445
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,900
If only you could hear her thoughts and find out what it takes for her to forgive you.

446
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,869
I might not be able to hear her, but I'll use all of my heart to get close to her.

447
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,149
Are you still that emotionless

448
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,720
money-making machine Su Zhinian that I know?

449
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:05,629
Return my Legend Su to me! Hurry! Return him!

450
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,430
I think she was right.

451
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,370
To love is an instinct. Not economics.

452
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,189
Dr. Yan and Director Su went to the amusement park. But why am I feeling more tired than them?

453
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,709
[Yan Yuan]
I'm honored to participate

454
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,090
in the Jiangli City International Exchange Conference with all the experts.

455
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,189
Director Su didn't come back after he went out in the afternoon.

456
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,510
So he didn't meet Dr. Yan?

457
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,850
The two of them weren't together.

458
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,729
Mr. Qin, a moment, please. Is this your cake?

459
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:53,300
Your name is written on it.

[Brother Yinan, Happy Birthday]

461
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,069
When did you receive the cake?

462
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,539
We didn't receive it.

463
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,619
We found it at the entrance when we were patrolling this morning.

464
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:07,379
Well, I noticed that your name is on it. So I waited until you got off work to deliver it to you.

465
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,070
Thank you.

466
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,949
Don't mention it. The cake was already as such when we found it.

467
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,370
It's okay.

I have two contracts here that require you to sign them.

471

You could have just asked Xiao Zhang to bring it over.

Qingchun, later, I'll...

Zheng Hao, did you say that there is a conference call?

475
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,019
Okay, you can share the file on DingTalk first.

476
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,999
Hello, Director Song.

Okay.

What did you say? What conference call?

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,780
Nothing. You can get back to work.

Come on in.

482
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,479
Brother Yinan. You left your phone in my office. Someone's looking for you. It seems pretty urgent.

483
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,650
Are you sleeping in the office?

484
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,850
Don't mention it. It's been three days.

485
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,440
Three days? Why are you sleeping here?

486
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,470
Hello, Acer.

487
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,850
I was busy just now.

488
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,690
Tomorrow's flight?

489
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,900
You and your wife are leaving. But remember to clean up my place.

490
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,730
Or you'll be in trouble when I go to Germany.

491
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,700
All right.

492
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,120
I'll have a farewell dinner with you tonight.

493
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,190
Okay. That's all for now.

494
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,000
My colleague from Berlin. His girlfriend came to China and crashed at my place for a few days.

495
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,469
I ended up having to sleep in the office for a few days.

496
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,500
I can finally go home tomorrow and have a good sleep.

497
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:45,179
Oh, right, I had some really tasty wonton at a roadside stall on my birthday.

498
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,900
I was afraid I would forget. So I checked in there.

499
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,500
I'll take you there sometime. I'm sure you'll love it.

501
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,440
What's wrong? Did something good happen?

502
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,080
Nothing. Brother Yinan, I'll make it up to you

503
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,020
and celebrate your birthday next time.

504
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,900
Okay. It feels like my birthday is incomplete without a cake.

505
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,539
Oh, right. What did you do during fieldwork?

506
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,400
I want to add more ideas into Qinghu project.

507
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,320
So Su Zhinian took me to Jiangli Happy Valley for research.

508
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,240
Su Zhinian is still the same.

509
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,140
He didn't change a bit. Always acting in an unconventional way.

510
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,090
Conduct real estate research at an amusement park.

511
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,189
Those who didn't know better might think he was pursuing you.

512
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,500
That's impossible.

513
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,300
I would be grateful enough if he didn't torture me.

514
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Qingchun is a big girl now.

515
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,600
It's normal for you to have suitors and admirers.

516
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,669
- Yes!
- What is it?

517
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:49,709
You know what? I came up with the idea of an ancient town when I was playing Dahua.

518
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:53,399
Su Zhinian just got in touch with the person in charge over there.

519
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,180
If Wancheng can win the project tender for the Qinghu project,

520
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,700
we might be able to reach in-depth strategic cooperation with Dahua.

521
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,500
My eight years of being a veteran player won't go in vain.

522
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,330
Brother Yinan, you don't think it's a good idea?

523
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,310
It's quite creative.

524
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,200
But as far as I know, Director Lin of Wancheng is more of a traditional person.

525
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,810
He might not be able to accept the idea based on two dimensions.

526
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,790
I see.

527
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,909
Su Zhinian is also to blame.

528
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,099
Even I know about this. How could he not report it to you?

529
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,680
But it's 2021 now.

530
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,400
The market positioning for Qinghu is focused on the younger generations.

531
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,200
I think there's no harm

532
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:48,000
in giving it a try. I might still be a novice in business.

533
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,300
But I'm pretty confident when it comes to trends.

534
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,079
I want to give it a try.

535
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,330
Qingchun is becoming more and more like a businesswoman.

544
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,430
Why are you here?

545
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,209
I get it now. I will not accept any harassment from the opposite sex during consultation hours.

00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:40,010
It's not what you think.

Do you want to invest in the hospital?

550

For example, ten things you must do with your partner.

How come I didn't hear him mentioning it?

560

It's a trade secret.

When do we get so close that we start sharing trade secrets?

Well, I make quite a good consultant for a dating app.

♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

638
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:58,160
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
