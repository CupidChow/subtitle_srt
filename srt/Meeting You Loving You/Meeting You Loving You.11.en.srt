20
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,639
-Brother Yinan used to tell me—
- No.

21
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,700
You...

22
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,740
Stop staring.

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,570
Aren't you adding too much vinegar?

24
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,530
I like it that way.

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,400
You have a problem with it?

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,340
You really are a capitalist.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,210
You really make every penny you pay count.

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,880
Just as I mentioned, won't you reconsider it?

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,990
No.

30
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,039
Penny-pincher, you won't even lend me 500 yuan.

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,150
That's what this is about?

32
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,110
So why did you mention Yinan?

33
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,930
Well... This is Brother Yinan's hometown.

34
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,289
He used to tell me that the night market here is worth a visit.

35
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,440
Well?

36
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,340
Yes?

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,989
Brother Yinan, try this out. It's delicious.

38
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,740
Try it out.

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,999
Consider this your way of making it up for me

40
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,420
after you made me miss the performance.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,690
Do you like it?

42
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,240
Are you happy now?

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,190
Mystery boxes!

44
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,149
Why are you taking me here?

45
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,839
Mystery boxes! Only fifty yuan each! Only fifty yuan each!

46
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,340
How do you know there are mystery boxes here?

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,710
It's the Halloween Series of Satyrs Rory!

48
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,429
I must get myself the rare Little Devil.

49
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,499
You're just losing money.

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,739
The probability of you getting it is one in every one hundred and forty-four.

51
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,999
Even if it's fifty yuan each, and you buy ten at once,

52
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,050
- that—
- Stop nagging.

53
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,739
Su Zhinian, there is a reason you are single.

54
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,700
This is a hobby, learn to have some fun.

55
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,279
Follow the trend and act like a young man.

56
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:47,119
Stop talking about money and business deals all the time.

57
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,800
That's so lame.

58
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,240
Come on.

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,050
I'll pick the rest.

60
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,610
If I get the rare item,

61
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,309
I want you to say it loud and clear

62
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,109
in front of everyone here, "Su Zhinian, you are amazing!"

63
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,330
"You are young and fun, you are my idol!"

64
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,459
If I can't get the rare item,

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,319
I'll give you an extra 1,000 yuan, keep the 500 yuan I lent you.

66
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,989
Since you're giving away your money, I see no reason to turn you down.

67
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,899
Old Man Su, admitting you are an old man is nothing to be ashamed of.

68
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,760
Remember our deal.

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,510
Sure.

70
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,950
Should we get some mystery boxes?

71
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,029
Sure.
Let's go.

72
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,859
This is the last one, please, let this be the rare item.

73
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:58,099
Rare item! Little Devil!

74
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,530
Come on!

75
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,760
This isn't it.

76
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,919
It's your turn now, start unboxing.

77
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,090
You can do the honor.

78
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,749
Su Zhinian, are you sure you haven't lost your mind?

79
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:16,559
This series is the Cute Pet series.

80
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,539
You can't win unless you get the right box, in your dreams.

81
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,230
What a...

82
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,970
This little ring looks cute.

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,569
Seeing you got me a cute one, you've earned another chance.

84
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,000
- Go ahead.
- You can do it.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,760
You want me to do it？

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,250
Okay.

87
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,660
Don't get disheartened, if you can't beat me this time,

88
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,100
you can try again with other games.

89
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,150
Su Zhinian! How did you get it?

90
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,779
You are amazing!

91
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,290
You're my lucky star!

92
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,100
Remember, our deal.

93
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,989
I know, I accept my defeat.

94
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,079
It's not like anyone here knows me, I'm not afraid.

95
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,430
Listen up.

96
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,219
Su Zhinian!

97
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,539
You are amazing!

98
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,199
- You are fun and—
- These are so cute.

99
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,029
What are the odds? What are you guys doing here?

100
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,760
Qingchun.

101
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,889
- Director Su.
- We were... We were...

102
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,399
We are here to see Director Lin for the Qinghu project. What about you?

103
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,889
The TV station sent Nuan Nuan to interview the ballerina, Mei Han Xiang.

104
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,290
I got a ticket from her.

105
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,290
You're interviewing Ms. Mei?

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,149
But you weren't there, otherwise, she would have invited you instead.

107
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:43,949
That's right. I wanted to invite you at first.

108
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,290
What is this?

109
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,039
Qingchun, how is your work with Director Su going along?

110
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,149
It was a success and we have other great news.

111
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,189
I'm going back to Jiangli tomorrow, what about you?

112
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,960
Me too.

113
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,000
Is... Is the interview over?

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,560
Yes, what's wrong?

115
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,450
- It's nothing.
- Song Qingchun.

116
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,389
You lost, you haven't finished your line.

117
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,679
There aren't many people around, Hurry up.

118
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:15,970
I'll finish it later. I'll finish it later.

119
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,590
I can't promise this thing will be around later.

120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,129
Su Zhinian, you are my biggest idol!

121
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,640
Are you happy now?

122
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,829
Nuan Nuan, the snacks are great, let's go get some. Let's go.

123
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,319
This is a proposal.

124
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:56,359
If there's nothing wrong, I'm sending it to Wancheng.

125
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm sorry for the sudden visit.

126
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,370
Come inside.

127
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,329
- Have a seat.
- That was close.
- Do you want some drinks?

128
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,020
Some water, thank you.

129
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,710
What?

130
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,630
Lipstick!

131
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,899
Pick up the lipstick for me, it's on the sofa Brother Yinan is sitting on.

132
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,699
You can finish your work first, I can wait.

133
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:15,999
It's nothing, It was some spam mails.

134
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,360
I had wanted to talk to you back in Haicheng.

135
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,059
But I didn't have the chance.

136
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,990
The only common topics we have

137
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,090
are Huateng Land and Qing Chun.

138
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,360
I've been looking for this. I've finally found it.

139
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,229
Lawyer Qin, you may tell me anything.

140
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,389
Su Zhinian, I've known you for years,

141
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,410
I can tell what's going on inside your mind.

142
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,079
As for Qingchun, you are nothing but the last resort for her.

143
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,420
It's only temporary.

144
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,010
Why are you worried, then?

145
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,840
Su Zhinian,

146
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,579
what is it that you want from Qingchun and Huateng Land?

147
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,450
That is not something I can easily explain.

148
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,719
How about this? Let's talk upstairs.

149
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:11,379
Wait here, let me put my stuff away.

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,169
Why are you here? Is he gone?

151
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
Why are you so nervous?

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,740
Where is my lipstick?

153
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,539
He probably didn't notice.

154
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,240
He already did.

155
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,860
He did?

156
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,659
- But...
- Why are you so worried that he might find out?

157
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:41,669
Mind your own business, just leave.

158

[Brother Yinan]

159
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,850
Oh no... He knows I am here.

160
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,870
You need to get out now.

161
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,140
Hello?

162
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,320
The meeting?

163
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,539
I need you to postpone the meeting.

164
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,660
If there is an issue, ask Director Song to sign it.

165
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,899
What is it? Do you need to use the restroom?

166
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,440
There is one over there, there is also one upstairs.

167
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,500
Never mind.

168
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,060
Let's go.

169
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,470
A relationship is not an investment.

170
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,570
The beginning dictates the result.

171
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,390
I had known her for ten years before the Song family took you in.

172
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,649
I basically watched her grow up.

173
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,950
Not to mention four years ago, you were...

174
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,230
After you left the Song family, I became the only person she could rely on.

175
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,719
Habit can be persistent.

176
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,320
Brother Yinan, could you come to the office? I need your help with a contract.

177
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,550
But with only 21 days, everything can be changed.

178
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,749
When Uncle Song needed help, her habit wasn't of any help to her.

179
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,280
She asked for my help immediately but I was too late.

180
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,000
I blame myself for the incompetence.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,679
I thank you for helping her, but now that I am back,

182
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,959
we don't need your help anymore.

183
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,319
I don't care why you couldn't make it back,

184
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm not interested.

185
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,310
But I must thank you for the second chance to win her back.

186
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,429
After all, my love for her has never changed.

187
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,160
What are the odds?

188
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,830
I can say the same. I like her.

189
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,070
I am certain I can win her over.

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,429
Brother Yinan, are you on the way now?

191
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:42,260
Some habits don't go away. Not to mention she is very nostalgic.

192
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,319
Sometimes, creativity can be bad for you.

193
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:51,160
I am a lawyer. My logic is impeccable.

194
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,170
Anyway, I will never give up on Qingchun.

195
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,049
I backed out once. But I won't do it again.

196
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:00,840
Let's see who's the winner.

197
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,839
Let's see who wins with class.

198
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,440
Qingchun needs me at the office.

199
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,450
I must go now.

200
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,950
If she needs you there, perhaps you should go.

201
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,929
If it's inconvenient for you, we could talk somewhere else.

202
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,779
It's okay. You are always welcome here.

203
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,180
Is he gone?

204
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,470
That was too close.

205
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,440
Such a coward.

206
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,900
What could you know?

207
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,580
Where are you going?

208
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,999
I need to see it through. I'm heading to the office.

209
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,340
- Brother Yinan.
- Why are you sweating?

210
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,969
It's okay. I can do it myself.

211
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:35,310
I just went out.

212
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,370
It sounded urgent, where is the contract?

213
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,410
When you texted me, I was at Su Zhinian's place.

214
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,929
That's why I'm late.

215
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,699
It's all right. It's not that urgent.

216
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,479
Don't you want to know why I was there?

217
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,799
You've known him for years, it's normal that you meet sometimes.

218
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,350
Or perhaps you've learned something suspicious?

219
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,000
Not at all.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,999
I went at a bad time. I think his girlfriend was there.

221
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:14,240
What girlfriend?

222
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,070
You two seem close, so I thought you knew.

223
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,649
I found a lipstick on his couch.

224
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:23,030
He was so nervous when I spotted it.

225
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,030
I should ask him the next time we meet.

226
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,009
By the way, is there any problem with the contract?

227
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:34,700
Let me check.

228
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,449
What do we have for dinner? I am starving.

229
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,350
Steamed fish.

230
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,080
Are you sure? Brother Yinan never used carrot slices on steamed fish.

231
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,449
Should I call him and ask him to show me the steps?

232
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,770
Have you lost your mind?

233
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,890
It took tremendous effort to overcome Brother Yinan's suspicion.

234
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,009
If he finds out, it's game over for me.

235

How much do you like Qin Yinan?

236
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,999
Or perhaps you find it so unacceptable to live in my house.

237
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,129
That's not what I mean.

238
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,040
I merely acted...

239
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,869
in accordance with our agreement. Yes.

240
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,680
Why do you need so much vinegar to steam the fish?

241
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,899
Who says I'm steaming the fish? I'm making West Lake Fish in Sour Gravy.

Is there nothing to do in the office when you are away?

326
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:44,229
Otherwise, how did your assistant get the time for blind dates?

327
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:46,680
All her blind dates were just terrible.

328
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,409
Why are you bringing her up?

329
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:54,399
I... I am concerned for the employer who pays her.

330
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:58,969
As your assistant, she needs to concentrate on her work.

331
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,979
What if... What if she gets lovestruck and neglects her job?

332
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,720
Is that so?

333
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,550
Of course.

334
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,439
I thought you were the one who's concerned with her love life.

335
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,889
See you. Pay the bill yourself.

336
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,080
Hey... Pay the bill for me.

337
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,330
If you don't want it, I'll finish it.

338
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,229
By the way, Director Song, you changed the venue

339
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:42,009
to your place so suddenly, so we didn't prepare anything.

340
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:43,519
What about the food?

341
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,059
Right, what do we have for food?

342
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,819
Don't worry. I got it arranged.

343
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,510
Arranged? Arranged?

344
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,379
Arranged.

345
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,179
Great.

346
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:55,790
- Let me get the door.
- Okay.

347
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,470
Try that one out.

348
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,920
- Nuan Nuan.
- Qingchun.

349
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,360
Come in. Come on.

350
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,350
Over here.

351
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,610
Is this enough for everyone?

352
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,339
You said there weren't many people, so I didn't buy much.

353
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,680
I can always count on you.

354
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,440
It's okay, I can do it.

355
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,950
Okay.

356
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

357
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,979
Here she comes. Let me introduce this beauty to you.

358
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,239
You must be Tang Nuan.

359
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,609
I watched your shows.

360
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:36,789
Ever since Director Song left, you've been hosting Young Chic, right?

361
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:40,129
Right. Why did you stop hosting the show? The show has been on hiatus.

362
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:42,260
That's right. Haven't you watched the news?

363
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,070
Come. Allow me to introduce to you, Tang Nuan,

364
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,089
the new producer and host of News Today.

365
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,240
She is also my best friend.

366
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,569
She bought all the food for us today.

367
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:56,340
Make sure to watch her show. Okay?

368
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,720
Stop nagging.

369
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,239
Sure. Director Song's friend is our friend.

370
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,139
You will have our support.

371
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,579
Yes. That's more like it.

372
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:05,679
Is this your department gathering?

373
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,899
Yes. They both worked hard for the Wancheng project.

374
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,330
So I promised to let them relax a little.

375
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,709
- All right. Let me put this aside.
- Leave it to me.

376
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,929
- Take this.
- I'll go take care of this.

377
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:19,689
He's finally here. Who else is coming?

378
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,780
The star of the show.

379
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,809
Our celebration can't go without the main contributor, Laywer Qin.

380
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,000
Brother Yinan.

381
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,279
This is too much, you should have invited me.

382
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,549
I was worried that you might be too busy with work.

383
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:43,179
Everyone is here. I'll help them out.

384
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:44,029
Go on.

385
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,270
Sure.

386
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,329
Did you pick this place?

387
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:56,699
Yes. It's Su Zhinian's place.

388
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,799
I went out of my way just to save some budget for our department.

389
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,689
Don't tell the others, I don't want them to feel uncomfortable.

390
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:03,999
Sure.

391
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,580
Let's go.

392
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,940
Xiao Yun, the drinks are cooled.

393
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,850
Over here.

394
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,579
I'll go get some ice.

395
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,090
Okay.

396
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,880
Brother Yinan.

397
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,060
Why are you here?

398
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,469
Qingchun invited me.

399
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,179
I prepared some fruit slices. Try them out. They are sweet.

400
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,169
Not bad, Director Qin.

401
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:41,920
What about us?

402
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,910
You can have one as well.

403
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,700
Director Qin, the fruit slice from you is delicious.

404
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,710
Try it out, it's tasty.

405
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,800
Director Song. Do you like it?

406
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,609
Look at this.

407
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,410
Yuan Yuan went to Geiger Capital for interview.

408
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,379
She passed. She wrote a post saying she owes it to Director Su.

409
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,620
She never meant what she said.

410
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,050
Director Su?

411
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,860
Why is he here?

412
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,809
Surprise! Isn't it amazing?

413
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,910
Let's welcome Director Su's arrival.

414
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,130
Welcome.

415
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,060
Director Su is here.

416
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,179
I promised I would throw a home party.

417
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:51,289
I was too busy, so I forgot.

418
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:55,069
Since you said you would be home late tonight, I invited everyone here.

419
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,099
I was at the end of my rope.

420
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,189
Just do me a favor for once.

421
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,339
Don't tell them that you live here and spoil the party.

422
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:04,960
If you agree to do me this favor,

423
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,289
I promise to do anything you want.

424
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,050
Okay?

425
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,840
Okay.

426
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,859
Thank you so much.

427
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,330
Well... Smile a little.

428
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,570
Fine.

429
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,270
Let's welcome Director Su to our party!

430
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,799
Welcome.

431
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,400
Everyone is here now.

432
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,979
You must be hungry. Let's get the barbecue started.

433
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:31,469
- All right.
- Yes, I agree.

434
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,669
Yes! Barbecue!

435
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:34,190
Come.

436
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,299
This smells delicious.

437
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,130
The food is ready.

438
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,830
Thank you.

439
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,069
The food is ready. Dig in.

440
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,669
Director Su. Thank you for attending our small gathering.

441
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:45,949
Let's welcome him.

442
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,570
Welcome.

443
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,970
Brother Yinan, try this out.

444
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,099
Does anyone have the bottle opener? Please pass it to me.

445
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,330
Thank you, Brother Yinan.

446
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,949
Director Qin, that was so cool. It's like watching a Korean drama.

447
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:10,539
I want a bottle of soda too.

448
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,050
Sure.

449
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:19,670
Director Su, you are just as impressive.

450
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,639
Brother Yinan, could you open the bottle for me?

451
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,480
I want some soda too.

452
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,020
Thank you, Brother Yinan.

453
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,510
This... Director Su, I'd love to have some soda too.

454
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,059
Director Su, you're the best.

455
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,410
Right, impressive.

456
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,970
Thanks, Director Song.

457
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,509
Well, now that everyone has their drink, let's have a toast.

458
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,139
To Huateng Land and everyone.

459
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,650
May Huateng Land have a bright future ahead.

460
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,079
- Yes!
- Yes, cheers. All the best!
- Cheers!

461
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,129
All the best to everyone.

462
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:11,740
All the best.

463
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,470
Dig in.

464
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,850
Let's dig in, I'm starving.

465
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,640
Sure.

466
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,570
Yes.

467
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,229
I need you to double-check the contract with them before sending me a copy.

468
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,370
Get it done quickly.

469
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,879
- Brother Yinan.
- Where are you going?

470
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,989
I'm getting some drinks from the storeroom.

471
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,270
How long have you been living with Su Zhinian?

472
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,949
I'm not living with him. He's not my boyfriend either.

473
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,040
What is he to you? A roommate?

474
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
It's not like he needed the money.

475
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,709
It's rent-free.

476
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,970
I consider it a credit-guarantee homestay.

477
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,419
Brother Yinan, I know I shouldn't have lied and said I lived with Nuan Nuan.

478
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:16,710
But I have my reasons. It's a long story—

479
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,240
I don't care what reasons you have, you need to move out of this place now.

480
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,630
I'll take care of accommodation if I must.

481
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,820
I can't move out just yet.

482
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,300
You just can't live without Su Zhinian, is it?

483
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
It's not me. Huateng Land is in bad shape—

484
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,800
Huateng Land can survive without him.

485
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,900
Qingchun, I promised I would help you.

486
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Do you know what others will say if they find out you are living with your investor?

487
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,100
What will they say? That I prostituted myself to save my father? That I am shameless?

488
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,200
Is that how you see me?

489
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,300
Of course not! I'm worried about you.

490
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,100
I don't want you to make regrettable mistakes just to save the company.

491
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,900
I assure you, I won't regret it.

492
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
If you really care about Huateng Land,

493
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,400
then let go of your prejudice against Su Zhinian.

494
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,700
He is used to protecting others' pride with his own methods.

495
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,800
He is compassionate. He patiently taught me so much.

496
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,500
He has total trust and support for his workers.

497
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Even with the people he hates, he is willing to be tolerant.

498
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,400
What I hope is for you to believe in me.

499
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,900
Believe that I am doing my best to save my father's company.

500
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,000
Where is the soda?

501
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,700
At this rate, I'll lose my trust in you.

502
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,900
I can get a mortgage instead.

503
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,000
You can judge how much I'm worth as your non-performing asset.

504
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Qingchun is doing great as the company's CEO.

505
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,000
She is even more popular now than she was at the TV station.

506
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,200
- Even Director Su—
- You knew they were dating.

507
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
You found out.

508
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,100
Why didn't you tell me?

509
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Does it matter?

510
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,500
Qin Yinan, don't forget I am your girlfriend.

511
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,100
You never asked why I was at the party. You never cared why I wasn't at work.

512
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,000
All you care about is who she's dating.

513
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,200
Don't you think you're being too much?

514
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,400
Or perhaps you've been lying to me.

515
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,900
You only care about her.

516
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,400
I've told you so many times, she is like a sister to me.

517
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,600
Huateng Land's reputation will be at risk if people find out she's living with an investor.

518
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
How am I supposed to trust you?

519
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,200
What do you want?

520
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,400
Let's tell everyone.

521
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,900
Nuan Nuan, your show is starting to become popular, now is not the time.

522
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,900
All right, that's enough. I don't like it when you get so paranoid.

523
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,100
Did everyone leave?

524
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the party beforehand.

525
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,600
Am I really that scary when I'm not smiling?

526
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,100
That depends.

527
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,300
Then are you pleased with my manners today, Director Song?

528
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,500
Hello?

529
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,900
What?

530
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,400
Okay, I got it.

531
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,800
Su Zhinian, I have great news for you.

532
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,800
The partnership with Wancheng has been greenlighted.

533
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Congratulations, Director Song.

534
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,800
Likewise.

535
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,600
How about I treat you to a meal tomorrow?

536
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,900
To thank you and to celebrate it.

537
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,800
- You're paying?
- Yes.

538
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
You can have anything you want.

539
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
We'll go to Jinling Restaurant.

540
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
You picked the most expensive option there is.

541
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
Are you serious?

542
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,500
Let's go to another restaurant.

543
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,000
I heard Jinling Restaurant is under renovation.

544
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
It was done over two weeks ago.

545
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Well... There is a Yunnan restaurant on the south side.

546
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,900
- The food is great. Let's try it out.
- I don't like spicy food.

547
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
- How about Cantonese cuisine?
- It's okay.

548
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,400
If you're not buying me dinner,

549
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,600
- I'll go somewhere else.
- Fine, my treat.

550
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Jinling Restaurant it is.

551
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,400
- Oh my, I feel sorry for Dr. Yan.
- Yeah.

552
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
I thought it was supposed to be a romantic story.

553
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,100
But now I just feel sad about the story.

554
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,800
I think I might root for someone else.

555
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,400
Qin Lu got heartbroken because of Director Shu! It pains me to read it.

556
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
I wonder when the new chapter will be available.

Yes, I can't wait to read it.

Dr. Yan. We weren't talking about you.

559
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,900
The Dr. Yan we talked about is the main character in a novel. Wait, he's the secondary character.

560
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,600
Come on. Tell me how the story goes.

561
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,000
Who is Director Shu?

562
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
Director Shu is a very wealthy tycoon.

563
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,300
Dr. Yan is a neurologist.

564
