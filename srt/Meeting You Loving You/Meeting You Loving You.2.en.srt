[Episode 2]

20
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,499
Huateng Land and Geiger Capital's cooperation can continue.

21
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:53,199
I'll invest in Huateng Land to help you rebuild your resources.

22
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,599
Find Uncle Song an expert and give him the best treatment.

23
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,510
But under one condition.

24
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,979
You must move in with me and be my assistant for 100 days.

25
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,290
Su Zhinian, don't push your luck.

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,649
If you want to manage Huateng Land, you have no choice.

27
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:13,860
I shouldn't have taken you home.

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,220
There's no free lunch in this world.

29
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,299
If you want to manage Huateng Land by yourself, then that is something you have to understand.

30
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,430
The brain is too hyper yet the EMG indicator is declining.

31
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,250
I think the car accident you had when you were three years old

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,439
had a certain impact on the development of your cerebral cortex,

33
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,249
which resulted in you being different from the rest of us.

34
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,059
However, that is still a largely unexplored field of research.

35
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,340
Until today, we still can't find a definite answer to it.

36
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,449
I'm more worried about how you'll get backfired every time you use your mind power.

37
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,380
It's very bad for your body.

38
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,550
So before we find any solutions,

39
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,150
can you stop yourself from trying to be a hero when it comes to your first love?

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,269
- It was an accident.
- Accident?

41
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,759
Is she your black hole of accidents?

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,610
I still have you, don't I?

43
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,839
She creates problems, and you solve them.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,039
I can conserve my energy. That's pretty good.

45
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,730
What?

46
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,210
If this goes on, I won't be certain if you can conserve it.

47
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,159
Don't blame me for not telling you.

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,260
You kept it under control so well.

49
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,140
Since Song Qingchun's father's incident,

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,169
tell me, how many times have you broken your promises?

51
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:54,349
Your physical data is not as stable as last time.

52
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,759
You'll be in trouble if you go on like this.

53
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,229
By the way, the research institute has feedback, saying the research made new progress.

54
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:04,940
You might be completely okay after three months.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,589
However, if you let my best friend's brain's crash before that happens,

56
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:12,039
I'm not letting you off the hook.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,319
Mama Yan, you're such a nag.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,800
Can you get them to speed up, then?

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,209
You're bleeding. Wipe it.

60
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,119
What's wrong?

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,860
The biker hit me with his helmet.

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,889
But you used your superpower. Can they still get close to you?

63
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,119
Song Qing Chun held my hand at the time. So I couldn't use my superpower.

64
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,750
Do you mean

65
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,780
you can't use your superpower on her?

66
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,349
As long as I come into physical contact with her, I'll lose my superpower and won't be able to control anyone.

67
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,809
I don't know what's on her mind. It has always been like this since I knew her.

68
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:59,170
I had no idea you two had such a twisted fate. Why didn't you report to me?

69
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,029
Report?

70
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,789
I know what you're thinking. I forbid you to experiment on her.

71
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,460
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,059
Fine. Don't do this. Put your head up.

73
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,980
Sorry to disturb you.

74
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,560
Wait.

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,139
- Get me a set of sheets and quilt.
- Why?

76
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,420
I'm spending the night here.

77
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,129
Okay. I'll get it right away.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,319
Why are you blushing?

79
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,829
Am I? It's my new blusher.

80
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,859
Your makeup is too thick. It doesn't suit you.

81
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,760
Thank you.

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,359
I can't believe he noticed this.

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,480
He's indeed suitable to be part of the sisterhood.

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,810
Director Su, is my makeup not suitable at all?

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,079
Please check the surveillance near Xinhua Road for me.

86
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,709
Okay. I'll leave you be, then.

87
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,610
Have an early night.

88
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,120
She's nuts.

89
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,680
Another day full of writing ideas.

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,149
Yan Zhi Yuan uses one hand

91
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,780
to cover Shu Jin Xin's eyes from the back.
 ["The CEO's Little Devil" Chapter 26]

92
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,000
And his other hand was holding something behind his back.

93
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,770
Hey.

94
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,830
Hey!

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,519
You boss me around but shrink like a coward when it comes to Song Qingchun.

96
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Hey!

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,610
What is it?

98
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,520
Say, you were the one who saved her.

99
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,119
But she looked angry just now. That's unreasonable of her.

100
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,650
I don't understand people with weird thinking like you two.

101
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,810
Something has been bothering me these few days.

102
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,880
The robbing incident by the bikers is odd too.

103
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
I want to transfer Uncle Song to your hospital.

104
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,130
After that, I'll be her father's attending doctor.

105
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,889
In any case, you're one of the best neurologists in Jiangli.

106
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:43,709
Even if there's no potential danger,

107
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,879
I feel more assured with you treating Uncle Song when he's still in a coma.

108
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,090
Uncle Song met me

109
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,480
to discuss Huateng's internal problems before this happened.

110
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,649
But if Huateng Land can push forward the strategic transformation program,

111
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,030
the prospect is actually very good.

112
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,609
But at the moment, I can't use Geiger Capital to invest in Huateng Land.

113
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,060
Don't tell me you're going to invest with your own money.

114
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,220
That's right.

115
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,819
I'm going to use another company, which is under my name.

116
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,029
Where did you get so much money in such a short time?

117
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:34,509
I used my previous investment and sold some of my properties abroad.

118
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,740
Are you out of your mind? What were you thinking?

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,039
Back then, Uncle Song learned that I got into an elite school, but I couldn't afford it.

120
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:50,829
He insisted that I become Qingchun's private tutor to protect my pride.

121
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,939
With a generous salary, I completed my education and applied to study abroad.

122
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:56,970
Like that, I lived with the Song family for three years.

123
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,799
He helped me a lot. So I want to do something for him.

124
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,780
Enough said.

125
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,119
I guess I didn't check you thoroughly just now. Let me see where exactly it had mutated.

126
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:09,339
Why does your brain prioritize love all of a sudden?

127
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,600
Actually, I'm still short of money.

- What?

that's for my future wife.

It's over now.

Heavens, what kind of friend do I have?

they looked into each other's eyes.

Miss Song, I found out that Director Liu of Quansheng Fund has booked the VIP venue at Poci this afternoon.

152
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:53,850
Director Liu may be the last person who's willing to help Huateng now.

Hello, Director Liu. Can you spare me some time?

I'm Song Menghua's daughter, Song Qingchun.

I would like to ask if you are interested in investing in Huateng Land.

I know Huateng is not in a great state now.

If I were you, the harder it is, the more resilient I will be.

471
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:41,089
Since you've sacrificed so much yet got so little investment in return.

472
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:45,469
After all, you'll have to manage Huateng yourself after 100 days.

473
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:47,020
So?

474
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,640
So from now on,

475
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,370
put aside your hostility towards me and learn to be a CEO.

476
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,340
Instead of being a puppet for 100 days.

477
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,039
You've made a promise to everyone at Huateng Land's press conference

478
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:02,690
that you would give everyone a satisfactory compensation scheme.

479
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,690
Read all these books.

480
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,579
The first test, how do you negotiate with the victims?

483
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,149
Those who believe in hope is not likely to have bad luck.

484
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,630
You can do it!

485
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:56,389
The first day of being 24 is the first official day of the cohabitation agreement.

486
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,629
It's hard. But it doesn't seem to be as hard as expected.

487
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,319
The hardest part of growing up is finally starting.

488
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,870
Born in a family others envy,

489
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,329
I sure had lived a life without any worries.

490
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:18,469
Even pursuing my dreams seemed to be more unrestrained and easy compared to others.

491
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,759
If I tell the "18-year-old me" that life is hard

492
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:31,820
and how my life is now, would she believe me?

493
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,169
The "24-year-old Song Qingchun" has decided to give up the spotlight,

494
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:40,730
return to the path without shortcuts

495
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,030
and embrace a new life.

496
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,190
I'll get up after another five minutes.
