Qingchun. Qingchun!

It's only the 50th minute.

22
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I haven't forgiven you yet.

23
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Qingchun,

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,200
give me some time. I promise to tell you everything.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Let's go home. It's too cold outside.

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Are you sleeping? Get up and drink some gingerale.

27
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
Come.

28
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,600
Qingchun, take this medicine.

29
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,400
I don't want to go rock climbing again.

30
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,500
We won't go anymore.

31
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,700
You even bullied me.

32
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm sorry. After you've recovered, you can bully me however you like.

33
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,500
Here.

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,400
What about the meteor shower you promised me?

35
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,200
All right. After you've recovered, we'll go.

36
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Be a good girl and take your medicine.

37
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
All done. Go to bed now.

38
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Don't catch a cold.

39
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Your fever is gone.

40
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
You're up?

41
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,700
Are you hungry? I'll make some breakfast.

42
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Last night,

43
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,600
did you promise to bring me to watch the meteor shower?

44
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,400
The weather forecast said it'll be cloudy tonight. The visibility is low.

45
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Besides, you just recovered.

46
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,600
Why don't we go next time? I'll definitely take you there.

47
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Come with me and try our luck.

48
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,100
We might be lucky.

49
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,300
I don't know when it will be the next time.

[Jiangli City. 12°C. Cloudy. Air Quality Good]

51
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,900
All right. Wrap yourself up warm. I'll get ready.

52
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,200
I want you to watch the Perseid meteor shower with me tomorrow night.

53
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Su Zhinian!

54
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Qingchun!

55
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,400
Careful. Be careful.

56
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,600
It's okay. You're safe now.

57
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,800
Why did you suddenly ask for the surveillance of Su Zhinian?

58
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,900
Is there anything wrong, or did Song Qingchun notice something?

59
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I used the same toy on purpose to test Song Qingchun.

60
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Judging from her reaction, she doesn't know anything.

61
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,500
But Su Zhinian is more interesting than I thought.

62
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
What did you find out about Su Zhinian?

63
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Well, there's nothing unusual about him except for one thing.

64
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,900
When he was a child, he underwent psychotherapy for a while.

65
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
The reason is delusional disorder.

66
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
- Delusional disorder?
- Yes.

67
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,800
He thought he had superpowers like those in the movies.

68
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,300
But he recovered after a year.

69
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,500
It's getting more and more interesting.

70
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,100
Continue to keep an eye on Su Zhinian.

71
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,600
I want you to approach the station regarding Qin Yinan's girlfriend's program.

72
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I hope her program gains more popularity.

73
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
All right.

74
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,399
Let's go.

75
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
You just recovered. Why are you so thinly dressed?

76
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
- Change it.
- I don't feel cold.

77
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
We're not going, then.

78
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you happy now?

79
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
This is more like it.

80
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,100
All right. Let's go.

81
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,400
What should we buy?

82
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,100
How about some fruits?

83
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
What are you doing?

84
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,000
I feel hot after moving around.

85
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,400
Here.

86
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,900
What are you doing?

87
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,600
You won't feel hot if you don't move.

88
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Look at that girl.

89
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,800
Her boyfriend is pushing her around the supermarket in the trolley.

90
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,600
What else do you want to eat?

91
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,100
This one.

92
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,200
- What else?
- That one.

93
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Okay.

94
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,400
I want that one.

95
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,900
Okay.

96
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,809
This one. This one.

97
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,300
Okay.

98
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,100
Are you serious?

99
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Tell me if you're cold.

100
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm not cold.

101
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Do you know the name of that star?

102
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Which one?

103
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Is it the red one?

104
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,700
I don't know.

105
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
It's called Orion.

106
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,400
In ancient Greek mythology, it's a tragic love story.

107
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,200
Tragic? What tragic love story?

108
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
It said that Poseidon, the God of the Sea, had a son,

109
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Orion, who was a great hunter.

110
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
The Goddess of the Moon, Artemis,

111
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
who was the sister of the God of the Sun, Apollo, fell in love with him at first sight.

112
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
The two fell in love with each other.

113
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
But one person strongly opposed their relationship.

114
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
That person was her brother, Apollo.

115
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Why did Apollo oppose the relationship?

116
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
It was because Artemis was so in love with Orion

117
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,400
that she neglected her duty to illuminate the night sky because of him.

118
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
Apollo couldn't watch his sister become worse.

119
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,800
So while Orion was hunting at the beach,

120
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
the glaring light from the sun reflected on the sea,

121
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,300
the Goddess of the Moon couldn't recognize
that was her lover.

122
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,900
After being tricked by her brother, she shot Orion to death.

123
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,300
After the glaring light receded,

124
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,200
she realized she had shot her lover.

125
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,500
During her grief, she couldn't light up the night sky anymore.

126
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,800
But Zeus couldn't bear to watch these two lovers being separated.

127
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,400
He placed him among the stars as the Orion constellation

128
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,800
to rise and set with the Goddess of the Moon.

129
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,600
So they can keep each other company at the right distance.

130
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,200
Is this story trying to warn us

131
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,900
that the more passionate it is,

132
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,500
the easier it is to hurt the people close to us?

133
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
We can't control ourselves

134
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
when we love someone.

135
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
That's enough.

136
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,500
The Observatory's forecast stargazing time is about to start.

137
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,800
Didn't they say it peaks at nine o'clock?

138
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,500
Why nothing has happened yet?

139
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,400
Don't tell me you've jinxed it. That's why we won't be able to see it tonight.

140
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,800
Don't worry. We'll be able to see it tonight.

141
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Why don't you go and have a rest first? I'll call you when it starts.

142
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,500
I'm not sleepy.

143
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,100
I want to stay here.

144
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Stay here and keep an eye on it then. I'll get something to eat from the car.

145
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
Okay.

146
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,400
Su Zhinian.

147
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Su Zhinian. Did I miss it?

148
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,300
Where are my stars?

149
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
Where's Orion you've mentioned just now?

150
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,600
Also... Apollo and Artemis.

151
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,000
Why are they all gone?

152
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Su Zhinian, you really jinxed it!

153
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
It's all your fault!

154
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
I didn't jinx it.

155
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,100
I told you this morning

156
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,000
that the weather forecast said it would be cloudy.

157
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,600
The latest news said the fog is suddenly formed in the mountains. So we won't be able to see anything now.

158
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Then why did you say we'll be able to see it just now?

159
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,800
Liar.

160
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm not a liar.

161
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,000
What's this?

162
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Is this your so-called meteor shower?

It's good news.

Song Senior's various indicators show that he's becoming more sensitive towards the response outside.

This means that he's going to wake up soon.

That's great. Thank you, Doctor.

You came to see me because of Su Zhinian, right?

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,029
You know him the most. Please tell me about his past.

We're not that close.

217
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,610
What makes you think I'll tell you?

218
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,120
Because Su Zhinian likes me, and you want him to be happy.

219
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,870
I've known him for seven years now. He rarely talks about himself.

220
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,600
In the past, I was hostile...

221
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,459
Until we met again, I accidentally found out that he's an orphan.

222
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:57,419
Then I realized that I didn't know anything about him.

223
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,360
I never thought of taking the initiative to know him.

224
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,410
It is rare for you to have such an awareness.

225
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,009
All right, then, I'll tell you.

226

Legend Su was involved in a fatal car accident when he was three.

227
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,830
His parents died in the accident.

228
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,669
He may not remember what happened, then.

229
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,019
But he never felt any warmth of a family all these years.

230
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,600
This has affected him greatly.

231
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,630
He is afraid of warmth.

232
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,909
He doesn't dare to accept it and show kindness to the world

233
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:36,300
because he fears losing it all again.

234
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,899
Those who don't understand him may think he's a cold and heartless person who's hard to approach.

235
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:46,059
Yet, they don't know he's only cold on the outside and soft on the inside.

236
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,020
He's a man of action who doesn't speak much.

239
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,319
I saw how he got along with the orphans.

240
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,019
He was gentle and patient.

241
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:01,369
Also, he may appear unreasonable for firing an employee who made a mistake.

242
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:04,420
But he provided them with a new job opportunity in secret.

243
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,170
For you to notice all these

244
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,920
shows that his investment isn't for nothing.

245

Why are you willing to tell me all these now?

It's because you like him too, am I right?

That's not cool. We've known each other for years.

How could you keep such an important thing from me?

268

It's fine to be a bit old-fashioned when it comes to dating.

But it will be a problem if it's not romantic enough.

Yes, it was him. He wasn't being sneaky about it.

I'm worried he has found out about the financial statement we fabricated.

Lest you're going to scare her away.

320
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,509
She's not as weak as you think.

321
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,170
Actually, it won't affect the two of you

322
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,780
from showing affection to each other if you don't tell her about it.

323
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,130
Moreover, there should still be

324
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,920
a mysterious vibe between couples.

325
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,090
I know you're doing this for my sake.

326
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,109
You don't want more people to know about my current condition that could bring unwanted troubles.

327
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:06,149
But it isn't easy for the two of us to be where we are today.

328
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:08,739
After we start dating, I don't want

329
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:12,820
to spend every day lying and keeping secrets.

330
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,199
I want to be honest with her, and this is what I owe her.

331
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:21,670
What if she thinks it's best to have privacy between couples?

332
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,909
You said so yourself that you don't know her that well.

333
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,550
I may never know what she thinks in this lifetime.

334
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,110
But I know how to love her.

335
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,559
The same goes for you. Stop denying how you feel.

336
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,070
My assistant has already touched your heart.

337
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,320
I gave her the day off today. So enjoy your Qixi Festival.

338
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,329
Director Su plans to confess his feelings to you today. Dr. Yan said so.

339
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,900
Since he wants to confess, I'm going to give you a chance, then.

340
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,849
You're home early, I thought you were accompanying Yan Yuan.

341
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,399
This guy prioritizes girls over his friend.

342
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,240
He ditched me halfway.

343
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,639
I even made a reservation at Jinling Restaurant.

344
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,470
It's such a waste.

345
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,140
Poor excuse.

346
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,579
It's hard to make a reservation at Jinling Restaurant on a day like this.

347
00:30:55,579 --> 00:31:00,409
It's a pity to let it go to waste. If he can't go, we can just go.

348
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,749
Won't it be wasting your time?

349
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:07,149
Not at all, I don't feel like ordering food delivery anyway.

350
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:10,630
Why don't we leave after I get changed?

351
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,949
- Sure.
- All right.

352
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,750
Yes.

353
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,319
Yan Yuan, can you play soccer with us?

354
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,869
Sure. Good boy, go and play first.

355
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,940
- I'll catch up with you later, okay?
- Okay.

356
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,270
So why did you bring me here?

357
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,990
I want you to get to know me better.

358
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,880
This is where I grew up. Su Zhinian and I met here.

359
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,559
It was Children's Day that day.

360
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,800
It was the first time that woman had brought me to the zoo.

361
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,030
It was also the first time she took me to KFC.

362
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,490
It was also the day she put on a rare and beautiful smile.

363
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,889
I thought she had changed and had already learned how to be a mother.

364
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:35,280
But women... The more beautiful the smile is, the more fake it is.

365
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,440
She told me to wait for her at the zoo entrance.

366
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,180
I ended up waiting all day and all night.

367
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,060
She didn't come back?

368
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,010
I guess she ran off with some other man again.

369
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,350
That's how she is.

370
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,539
She can give up everything for her so-called love.

371
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,570
So since I was a kid, I've always thought love is a scary thing.

372
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,079
It made me lose my childhood and a mother's love.

373
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,769
Similarly, it made me lose my view of what love is.

374
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:19,800
Even if I've dated so many times,

375
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,090
I never dared to love with all my heart.

376
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,670
Also,

377
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,130
physical intimacy is not involved

378
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,650
because

379
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,570
I don't want to end up like her.

380
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,619
So all these years, you don't dare to trust anyone

381
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,650
other than Director Su.

382
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,419
When Su Zhinian rescued me from hell,

383
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:48,329
I always felt that there was nothing

384
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:52,980
to lose in this world except him and my job.

385
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,269
What happened in the past wasn't your fault.

386
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,839
But keep hiding behind your childhood trauma

387
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,839
instead of facing your life with courage is cowardly behavior, you know?

388
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,360
Where are you going?

389
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,670
Going back to work.

390
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,619
You've told me Director Su's plans, so I followed you here.

391
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,220
Our deal is completed.

392
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,060
You took this as a deal?

393
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,890
You were the one who treated this as a deal.

394
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,740
You brought me here and told me everything.

395
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,939
Isn't it because you wanted me to know your past?

396
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:31,660
So I could understand you

397
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:36,540
and stop asking for your love without reason like before.

398
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:40,660
Dr. Yan, the answer doesn't matter.

399
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,469
When you truly like someone, she can feel it

400

even if you don't tell her.

401

Since I'm done eating, it's time to get to the point, right?

00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,610
I'll get going now.

479
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,989
- Wait, help me to—
- What do you mean by "there are only three months left"?

''Passing Through Your Memories'' - Zheng Guofeng

481
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:26,990
♫  In the end, I can only watch you  ♫

482
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:35,689
♫  walk towards happiness as I'm just a guest  ♫

483
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,380
♫  A love that I can't grasp  ♫

484
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,719
♫  Making promises I can't fulfill  ♫

485
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,270
♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

486
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:57,450
♫  The encounters we had  ♫

487
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:05,879
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart  ♫

488
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,730
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

489
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,210
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

490
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:24,750
♫  I'll continue to search by myself  ♫

491
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,630
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

492
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,280
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

493
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,999
♫  What can tear two hearts that beats as one  ♫

494
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,830
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

495
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:49,090
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

496
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:55,500
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

497
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,130
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

498
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,120
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

499
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:10,349
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

500
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:14,270
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

501
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:20,150
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

502
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:26,530
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
