Durector Su is the biggest shareholder in Huateng Land and the person in charge of Geiger Capital too.

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,900
In the beginning, we were more than welcome for your willingness to invest in Huateng Land.

31

But you've seen the situation now.

For the benefit of the company

I suggest that you take some rest for a while.

What if I don't want to accept this suggestion?

36
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,699
This is the classic example of Geiger Capital's malicious acquisition over the years.

37
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:04,700
We have reasons to believe that you've controlled Director Song with illegal means.

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,960
You secretly used your power to control Huateng Land

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,000
and take the opportunity to carry out a hostile takeover.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,800
If you have concrete evidence, you can sue anytime.

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
I can see you're not planning to accept our suggestions.

42

Then let Qingchun take the blame.

43

I can see she's naturally licentious. She won't care...

It's publicly known that the Chairman of Huateng Land, Song Menghua,

It's fortunate that we started dating four years ago.

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Due to my work profession, we kept our relationship a secret

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,200
because we didn't want to give anyone a chance to slander Huateng Land and Geiger Capital.

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,500
We are extremely sorry for the waste of public resources caused by this incident.

The board of directors is upset that I acted without informing them.

If we want this matter to subside,

150

we must let the public know we're dating.

This kind of exposure is a must.

152

All right. I'll get back to them.

153

To pretend to be a couple?

154
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,400
Can't you think of any other ideas?

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,200
My acting is pretty okay.

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,400
At worst, I can just wear a poker face. Isn't that how an overbearing boss act in a drama series?

157
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,700
Please don't make your age obvious to all. Generation Z, like us, doesn't watch such dramas.

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,600
Let me give you a hand.

159
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,800
I want you two to sit facing each other. Face each other.

160
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,800
Hurry up. Face each other.

161
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Look at each other.

162
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,100
Closer.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,100
Listen to my command and make a corresponding expression.

164
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,900
Happy.

165
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Feel wronged.

166
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,000
I said, wronged.

167
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Sad.

168
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
- Stop laughing.
- Okay.

169
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,800
Now, the difficult part.

170
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,300
"I like you."

171
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,700
Can I blink my eyes?

172
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
Sorry. We'll do it again.

173
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
Dr. Yan, do you think this will work?

174
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
I can't even see.

175
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,800
Just do this, then.

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
What is this?

177
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,700
It's a good idea. Just do this.

178
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,800
Stop messing around.

179
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,400
I never thought of hurting you. I was also drunk that night.

180
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,200
I didn't even know how I got to your room.

181
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,100
In your eyes, am I a scum who would take advantage of you while you blackout from being drunk?

182
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,000
Su Zhinian is not such a person.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
Maybe I've misunderstood him.

184
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,000
Hello, Director Song.

185
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
Hello, Zheng Hao. I need a favor.

186
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,400
Sure, Director Song. What do you need?

187
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,000
Can you find all related footage from Anying Bar to my house

188
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
on the night of June 3, four years ago?

189
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The time is after 8.40 PM.

190
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,500
June 3? Isn't that your birthday?

191
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Don't let anyone know about this matter first.

192
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,200
Okay.

193
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Thanks.

194
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,600
- Miss Song, please wait. Let me tidy up your clothes.
- Thank you.

195
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,900
Miss Song, our theme is from school uniform to wedding dress.

196
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,700
Today, we're going to shoot the school scenes.

197
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,400
Okay. Where's Mr. Su?

198
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,600
Mr. Su is ready.

199
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Okay.

200
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
Let's go.

201
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,500
If you don't wear your uniform neatly, the director of teaching and learning will give you demerits.

202
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,900
Miss Song, Mr. Su needs makeup. Why don't I...

203
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,100
It's okay. He looks fine. I'll just put lipstick on him.

204
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
- Come on.
- Okay.

205
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,300
Sit.

206
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,000
This one will do.

207
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Hey, don't draw on my face.

208
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,500
It's for the lips.

209
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
Done.

210
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Miss Song, did you put blusher on Mr. Su too?

211
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
What color is this?

212
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,389
It may look too bright, but it'll look natural on screen.

213
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,500
Then you'll have to ask Mr. Su.

214
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Mr. Su, what color is this?

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,400
I have no idea. But I don't like the color of this lipstick.

216
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,200
You don't like this color? Then which color do you like among all these?

217
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Just try them one by one.

218
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
One by one?

219
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,600
Then I leave you two to it.

220
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,000
All right. Then I'll test it on you.

221
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,400
We'll try all of it.

222
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
Not this one. Not striking enough.

223
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
Look at the mirror.

224
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,500
It's the same as Angelina Jolie's lipstick color. Is it sexy?

225
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
It's pretty.

226
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,500
Don't wipe it. Just leave it on. I think you look good in it.

227
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,400
All right. Look over here.

228

Is it the same pose?

Yes.

All right.

231

Ready.

232

They look pretty good together.

- You're right.

Director Song, you mentioned Huateng Land's future development plan.

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,500
I wonder if it is related to you making your relationship public?

249
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,800
My dad was the one who made the development plan long ago.

250

If it weren't for the recent false rumors on the internet

251
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,800
that affected the image and interests of the two companies,

252
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,200
we still wouldn't choose to make our relationship public.

What about the pictures?

254

I've already explained it at the press conference.

But for those who took our photos and spread them with malicious intent, we won't let them off that easily.

It looks like you get along very well.

I'm sure that most of the netizens are as curious as I am.

Can I see you often after this?

I mean, you have good grades. You can tutor me.

I guess it's the good looks. I'm pretty shallow-minded.

272
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm sure the majority of female viewers are as shallow as you.

What about you, Director Su? Is it because of good looks too?

No.

She may be impulsive and act tough.

276
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
When she's scared, she talks a lot.

Can't you be more humble?

319
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,549
You've been staying with Miss Song for a while now.

320
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,789
Why didn't you learn anything positive from her?

321
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,040
Yet, you've become more violent.

322
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,210
Here.

323
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,580
Why did you suddenly have breakouts?

324
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,059
Listen, pimples on your chin could mean an issue with the endocrine system. You have to take care of it.

325
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,450
What?

326
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,620
Don't you find Dr. Yan is a bit odd today?

327
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,039
- Is he?
- Isn't he?

328
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,440
Is he not a fan of spicy food?

329
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,869
My pimples have nothing to do with eating spicy food.

330
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,530
So I can eat it.

331
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,069
Su Zhinian doesn't eat spicy food too. It's okay. We'll eat it.

332
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,489
Hot and sour soup. Dr. Yan, try it.

333
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,350
Thanks.

334
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,969
Sorry about that, Dr. Yan. I thought you loved spicy food. That's why I made it extra spicy in every dish.

335
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:43,349
It's okay. It's pretty good.

336
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,150
Pretty good.

337
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,649
I'll get it. It's food delivery.

338
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,309
We have so many dishes. Is it not enough for him?

339
00:25:57,309 --> 00:25:59,160
- What a fuss.
- It's tasty.

340
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,200
Coming!

341
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,809
Hello, I'm Fresh Hema's deliveryman. Here's your coconut chicken hotpot set meal.

342
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,390
Please check.

343
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,089
You really delivered it within 30 minutes. Thank you.

344
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:18,870
Please enjoy your meal.

345
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,290
What do you think? Smells great, right?

346
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,680
Let me try it first.

347
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,439
This is what I call high class.

348
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,140
It retains the original flavor of the food.

349
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,310
Why don't you all try?

350
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,389
What you're eating isn't the taste of the food

351
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,419
but the spiciness of the hot peppers stimulates the brain.

352
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,009
This feeling will stay on the tongue and stimulate your appetite.

353
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,790
It's not related to whether it's delicious or not.

354
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:07,389
Stop eating spicy food if you can't eat it. Your face is all red.

355
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,479
I find spicy food delicious now.

356
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,679
Besides, there aren't any classes in food.

357
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,869
Try this one.

358
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,920
Take it away from me.

359
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,679
Don't take too much spicy food.

360
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,929
Look at your pimples. Why are you still eating?

361
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:24,269
It's none of your business. It's my face. I'm happy with it.

362
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,159
It's because it's yours that you need to cherish it.

363
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,759
Use this when you're home. Your face will be okay soon.

364
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,199
By the way, why did you call us over?

365
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,679
It's not just to treat us to a meal, right?

366
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,349
Didn't you say we have bad acting?

367
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,259
It's better to learn from you as we are going to attend a reality show.

368
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,759
You've found the right guy.

369
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,920
I have all the good stuff.

370
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,510
Look at this picture.

371
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,859
Couples in love desire physical contact subconsciously.

372
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,619
The way they hold hands shows which stage the couple is at

373
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,250
in their relationship.

374
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,969
You two. Show me how you hold hands.
[Nine Common Ways of Couples Holding Hands]

375
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,179
To others, you're a couple who have been dating for years.

376
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,739
Even if you're no longer passionately in love, you're not...

377
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:39,350
You're also not at the first stage of dating.

378
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,150
I'll give you a demonstration.

379
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,690
Both of you may be this type.

380
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,210
It's also probably...

381
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,769
Clench it! This type.

382
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:09,280
If you want to spice things up,

383
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,590
it could be this type.

384
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,529
Stop it. Try it on Cheng Qingcong.

385
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,150
Let's do a demonstration for them.

386
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,519
That hurts! Let me go.

387
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,039
A demonstration, you say? You perv doctor.

388
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,620
Cheng Qingcong, you deserve to stay single all your life.

389
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,099
Who says I'm single? My boyfriend is overseas.

390
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:37,869
He'll come back soon.

391
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,530
The present I asked you to pick was for him.

392
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm going to get some water.

393
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,659
I never tried to act tough. Can't you share more of my strengths?

394
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,639
Look at how affectionate they are. Director Song is so fortunate.

395
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,369
All the demolition works of Qinghu have been completed. It's time for the next procedure.

396
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,619
Those from Wancheng Group will be at Qinghu tomorrow as well.

397
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,070
But we have some funding issues.

398
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,209
I've prepared the funds. It'll be transferred soon.

399
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,720
Then we can do a site visit.

400
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,310
Who's that?

401
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,630
You'll know when you get there.

402
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,390
You are...

403
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,050
I'm Yu Wanting.

404
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,650
[Yu Wan Ting. I'm okay with what you asked. I'll be back next Monday.]

405
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,830
You are here. Why didn't you call me?

406
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,020
Welcome back.

407
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,119
Sorry. I've forgotten about your habit.

408
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,439
I've read the proposal on the plane.

409
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,439
I can only stay for three days this time.

410
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,250
So I suggest we'll head to the site right away.

411
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,129
I know your habit. Let's go.

412
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,960
Come on, Director Song.

413
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,120
Take the pills for motion sickness first.

414
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,780
Thanks.

415
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,479
Get some rest first.

416
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,129
When we reach there, Director Song will tell you about the situation there.

417
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,839
You have a sore throat? I told you not to eat too many chips.

418
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,550
Thanks.

419
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,349
Stop nagging at Director Song.

420
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:27,979
Didn't you like eating chips when we were overseas?

421
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,390
We can set off now, Sir.

422
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,439
We'll look for some valuable IP to combine with the ancient town's operation

423
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,420
to increase the dimensions of the cultural tourism experience.

424
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,719
For instance, introducing some popular ancient games to Qinghu

425
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,740
and set up some stores that can offer offline experiences.

426
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,149
At the same time, we'll also shoot movies or TV series here

427
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,919
to turn Qinghu into a unique tourist attraction like the ancient city of York.

428
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,650
Hearing you say that makes me interested in this project. So our next step will be...

429
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,320
Director Song,

430
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,210
this project is not going as smoothly as you've said.

431
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:16,739
You haven't even solved the most basic demolition issue. How are we going to cooperate?

432
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,710
Director Yu, please wait for a moment.

433
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,549
Director Song.
 [No Demolition]

434
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,149
Mr. Zhao won't open the door. Stop wasting your time here.

435
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:27,739
I'm trying to find other ways to contact his family.

436
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,450
But it's hard to persuade him.

437
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,739
Director Yu, please give me one day. I'll give you a satisfactory explanation.

438
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,250
Let's show Director Yu other parts of the area.

439
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,629
Manager Chen, come with me. What happened? Why isn't the demolition problem solved yet?

440
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,100
We've talked to Dahua Xiyou.

441
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,439
After this, we might work together to set up pop-up stores.

442
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,070
Su Zhinian,

443
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,099
you should know the project isn't the reason I returned this time.

444
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:57,149
I confessed my feelings to you before.

445
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:00,549
You said love isn't part of your life plan.

446
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,710
It hasn't been long since you returned.

447
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,999
Here you are announcing your relationship in such a high-profile manner.

448
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,269
Are you doing this to stop me from pursuing you?

449
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,290
I never lie to my friends.

450
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,219
There wasn't love in my plan because she hadn't appeared.

451
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:16,709
I'll take care of the problems here.

452
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,939
You've already seen the prospect of the project. There's no harm considering it.

453
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:25,259
I'm investing in Huateng Land's project and I need to see Song Qingchun's capability to solve problems.

454
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,069
I've talked to Mr. Zhao.

455
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,379
While we retain his original house, we'll double the compensation.

456
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:40,399
I've also sent him the transformation plan of his house.

457
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,610
He has agreed.

458
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,439
Boss, I've met Mr. Zhao today.

459
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,189
He rejected our terms.

460
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,220
Why did he reject it?

461
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,379
Song Qingchun met him this afternoon and gave him a higher offer.

462
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:59,349
This old man only cares about money, so he has accepted it.

463
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,739
Boss, calm down. We still have a few holdouts who will cooperate with us.

464
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,590
I get a general idea of the project.

465
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,019
But you know I have my standard of handling things.

466
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:26,490
So I should...

467
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,559
Someone instructed Mr. Zhao to stay. By the lake, hurry!

468
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,959
Go back to the hotel first. I have something to do.

469
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,360
Help!

470
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,320
Help!

471
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,600
It wasn't a dream.

472
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,120
You're awake.

473
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,950
How are you feeling?

474
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,050
Do you feel unwell?

475
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,710
Did you send me to the hospital?

476
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,049
I happened to pass by and saw you passed out in the corridor.

477
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,869
Are you okay?

478
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,810
Is this the first time you fainted, or are you not well recently?

479
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,490
If necessary, you should do a full body checkup.

480
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,319
It's okay.

481
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,749
I know my health very well.

482
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,319
It's nothing serious.

483
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,489
If there's nothing else, let's go back to the hotel.

484
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,490
Forget about the hotel.

485
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,490
We should head back to the city.

486
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,549
What about the project?

487
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,211
If she can't solve such a small matter,

488
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:10,189
how can I feel assured to hand over such a huge amount of money to her?

489
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,549
To be honest, at this point,

490
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,819
be it the project or her, I don't have high hopes.

491
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,440
Of course,

492
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,069
if you insist that I invest in her,

493
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,629
I won't refuse for your sake.

494
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:32,650
The problem now is, are you sure that you want to go against your principle for her?

495
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,839
I won't go against my principle for her.

496
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,319
I just trust her.

497
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,439
If you give her more time, she'll prove to you

498
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,069
that she and the project are worth investing in.

499
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,070
You're that confident?

500
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,579
Don't forget that being emotional is taboo in investment.

501
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:52,570
Okay. We'll wait and see.

502
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,689
By the way, please keep a secret about what happened last night.

503
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,779
I'm sorry. We're not sure who sent you back last night.

504
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:17,730
As for Mr. Su, we didn't see him either.

505
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,670
All right. Thank you.

506
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,450
- Where have you been?

♫  In the end, I can only watch you  ♫

509
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:11,600
♫  walk towards happiness as I'm just a guest  ♫

510
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,830
♫  A love that I can't grasp  ♫

511
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:22,170
♫  Making promises I can't fulfill  ♫

512
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,390
♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

513
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,900
♫  The encounters we had  ♫

514
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:41,200
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart  ♫

515
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,179
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

516
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,559
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

517
00:42:51,559 --> 00:43:00,100
♫  I'll continue to search by myself  ♫

518
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,979
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

519
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:08,800
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

520
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,400
♫  What can tear two hearts that beats as one  ♫

521
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,179
♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

522
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:24,400
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

523
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,700
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

524
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,479
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

525
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:39,370
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

526
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:45,799
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

527
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:49,719
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

528
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:56,890
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

529
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:02,380
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
