21
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,619
I didn't take Dr. Yan for a romantic person.

22
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,509
He picked such a nice place for lunch.

23
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,780
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes.

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,670
The flowers are beautiful too.

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,159
Come on. Smile.

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,469
Look.

27
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:15,250
Don't you think that Mr. Su looks better than the flowers?

28
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,909
A dining car. Feeling thirsty?

29
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,640
I'm in a good mood today.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,559
What would you like? My treat. Order away.

31
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,910
Here.

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,960
Hi, anyone here?

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,109
Welcome!

34
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,659
What would you like to eat or drink? Feel free to order.

35
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,530
It's all free.

36
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,179
Cong Cong. Why are you here?

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,660
We've been watching you two.

38
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,419
Hugging each other and taking photos.

39
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,020
It's so unbearable.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,739
But things are different for those who are married.

41
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,930
When will I have such happiness for real?

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,890
Dr. Yan, you have quite an agenda.

43
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,349
On the face of it, it seems like you're celebrating for us.

44
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,120
But the truth is you're actually creating a chance

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,700
to go on a date yourself.

46
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,594
Don't expose a man, or it's going to be upsetting.

47
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,410
Let's go over there.

48
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,910
Let's go.

49
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,080
- Congrats to the newlywed!
- Congrats to the newlywed!

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,380
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

51
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,687
Director Song, try this.

52
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,738
It's really good.

53
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:53,338
Here. What song is that? It sounds so familiar.

54
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:55,217
That's the famous song of Yan Yuan's goddess.

55
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,547
The theme song of "La Boum". It hasn't changed at all.

56
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:59,428
Goddess?

57
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,377
I thought you didn't have one?

58
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:04,657
Don't listen to him, Sophie Marceau is his goddess.

59
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:05,958
- Your goddess?
- Otherwise, back then...

60
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,757
- It's his.
- I couldn't possibly do that in the cinema when I was young...

61
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,458
First kiss, huh?

62
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,778
Cinema?

63
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:16,338
It sounds like they have a story to tell.

64
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:19,818
Spill it. Tell us your story.

65
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,337
Were there many people at the marriage registration office?

66
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:28,517
There were so many people, but if you have all the documents ready—

67
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:31,617
Hey, you two! Can you be franker?

68
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:33,757
It definitely feels like something isn't right.

69
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:36,117
Wait. Let me guess.

70
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:39,528
Was it your first love?

71
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,758
First kiss?

72
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:44,228
- Or your first...
- Don't be silly.

73
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:47,098
Don't you know who my first love is?

74
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,998
Since it wasn't Director Su's first love,

75
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,858
it must be yours then.

76
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:57,797
Well, as to who your first love was, I'm not sure I know.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,858
There's really nothing much to tell.

78
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,927
Is there really nothing much to tell,

79
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,528
or was it so unforgettable that you didn't want to talk about it?

80
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:08,928
Or is there a reason why you played around?

81
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:11,217
It was because you'd been hurt so badly by your first love.

82
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,167
What are you thinking?

83
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,908
I was only seven or eight back then.

84
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:18,348
Stop laughing.

85
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:22,357
You girls didn't know that he looked more comely than a girl when he was a kid.

86
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,417
Something was wrong with your eyes. Don't pin that on me.

87
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:28,107
Well, Su Zhinian has a pretty face, even now, Isn't it?

88
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,228
You're the only one who thinks that.

89
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,847
All right, I'm going to the washroom.

90
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,267
- I'll come with you.
- No.

91
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,768
Are you feeling shy?

92
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,927
You two are going to the washroom together?

93
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,988
Running away is all you know.

94
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:57,867
Don't be upset, Director Su's surgery will go well.

95
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,498
I know.

96
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:06,958
Don't worry, I even bought the bubble stick.

97
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,828
It's beautiful.

98
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,787
Check this out, let's have a look.

99
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,498
How does it look?

100
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:32,618
Thank you for today.

101
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:36,518
Why are you being so courteous with me?

102
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,818
I really am happy for you.

103
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:42,718
Song Qingchun is indeed a great girl.

104
00:06:58,488 --> 00:06:59,817
Come on.

105
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,318
A while more.

106
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:05,187
If I'm there, she'll have to spare my feelings

107
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:08,428
and pretend to be happy.

108
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,408
Let her blow off some steam.

109
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:22,308
Help me take some pictures with Su Zhinian later.

110
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,387
No problem. Look, I've brought so many photo papers.

111
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:27,100
It's more than enough for your wedding photo shoot.

112
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,400
Let's take a selfie first.

113
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:28,498
Here.

114
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,808
Three, two, one.

115
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,907
Come over! Let's take pictures!

116
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,618
Hello!

117
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:46,988
Coming!

118
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,468
Come on. Let's take a group photo.

119
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,868
Come nearer to me.

120
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:55,158
- All set.
- Here.

121
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,158
Three, two, one.

122
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:04,370
- Let me take a look.
- Three, two, one. I'll take some photos of you two.

123
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,588
Get closer. Closer!

124
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:08,117
- Okay.
- Hold each other.

125
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:10,468
- Carry her.
- Three, two, one.

126
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:14,607
- Nice.
- Another pose. Carry her.

127
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:17,568
- Be more intimate.
- Three, two, one.

128
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,648
Let's see.

129
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,408
Look at this.

130
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,318
No, not intimate enough.

131
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,068
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

132
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,358
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

133
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,798
Nice. Hold that pose.

134
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:47,348
This is nice. I'll take a few more shots.

135
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:48,968
A few more shots.

136
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,658
What are you looking at?

137
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,708
Look.

138
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,197
Who's this guy? He's so good-looking.

139
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,617
That's right. Whose husband is he?

140
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,147
Let's go to the mall tomorrow and buy some photos frames to frame these up.

141
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:18,388
Okay, we need to get the big ones

142
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:21,368
and frame these then hang them up in the house.

143
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,798
I...

144
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:50,438
I'll take a bath first.

145

Hey, guys! We meet again.

187
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,877
Hurry. Mr. Su, say hi to everyone.

188
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,378
Hello, everyone! I'm Mrs. Su's husband.

189
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:32,418
I'm Su Zhinian.

190
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:35,457
That's right. It's only been two days since Mr. Su and I got married.

191
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,277
But still, there are no flowers. No date.

192
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,638
No candlelight dinner.

193
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:44,218
Mr. Su is a penny-pincher, don't you think?

194
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,058
- Look. I made some remarks about him, and he's upset already.
- How would I possibly upset Mrs. Su?

195
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:48,538
- Right?
- Good that you know.

196
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,398
- It hurts.
- So annoying.

197
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,818
What are we having for dinner?

198
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:54,537
This is your favorite flower, isn't it?

199
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,737
My favorite? Are you going to give it to me as a flower?

200
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,367
No. I'll teach you how to choose them.

201
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,538
Okay.

202
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,697
Here we go. What's this?

203
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,297
It's Mr. Su's lecture time.

204
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,567
Look. Look at the broccoli that I have.

205
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:12,057
First, avoid the yellowish ones because they are past the peak freshness.

206
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:16,247
Second, when we choose broccoli, take note of its flower balls and buds.

207
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:21,597
In general, fresh broccoli comes with tight heads, not a loose bunch.

208
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:23,517
It's best if it's like my hair.

209
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:26,347
Also, take note of the surface of the flower balls.

210
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:28,977
It's not uneven, and it gives a compact and bulgy feeling.

211
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:32,288
The buds of the head of a good broccoli are firm and tight.

212
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:34,458
Mrs. Su. Are you even listening?

213
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,678
I'm asking you if you are listening.

214
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,357
I am. Really, I am.

215
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,047
- Well. What else do you want to eat?
- It was a long explanation.

216
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:44,197
I'll buy them for you. You can have them all in a go and make you turn chubby like a pig.

217
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:47,048
I don't want to turn into a pig.

218
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:49,978
What are you making for dinner?

219
00:15:49,978 --> 00:15:53,237
I'll make you anything you want. So what else do you want?

220
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:57,618
I want pear with rock sugar soup.

221
00:15:57,618 --> 00:16:00,137
Okay. Let's go, We'll get some pears.

222
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:03,177
Then, we'll buy Mrs. Su's favorite preserved plum, all right?

223
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,847
Okay! Did you see that?

224
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,697
Mr. Su is finally catching on.

225
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,697
Finally, he's going to cook for me.

226
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:10,717
Not only am I catching on, I'm becoming obsessed too.

227
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,957
- So obsessed with Mrs. Su that I'm hooked on her.
- What a sweet-talker.

228
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:15,157
- We're going to get some pears now.
- Okay.

229
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,178
- Bye.
- Bye.

230
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:26,478
That's too many.

231
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:29,377
It's okay. In the future...

232
00:16:33,178 --> 00:16:35,078
What?

233
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:38,277
You're teaching me how to cook.

234
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:41,817
So after this, I'll cook for you.

235
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,648
Okay?

236
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:44,967
Are you sure?

237
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,858
It's nothing difficult.

238
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:51,057
Okay. Make sure you watch and learn.

239
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,738
Then, you can cook for me.

240
00:16:52,738 --> 00:16:54,397
Got it, let's go.

241
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:55,798
Let's go.

242
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:11,337
Are you okay?

243
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:13,007
I'm fine. It's nothing.

244
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,718
Be careful.

245
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,948
Here goes the last two.

246
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:24,278
Keep it up.

247
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:26,248
I feel my married life is somewhat

248
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:29,038
different from what I originally imagined.

249
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,957
Getting to spend every day with you, that's what life is.

250
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:40,337
Not too much pressure.

251
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,138
Here.

252
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:44,108
Do it slowly.

253
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:48,438
Look. It's not as hard as you think.

254
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:52,178
If possible,

255
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:55,478
I hope you can stop ordering takeout.

256
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:57,197
Don't just drink yogurt and eat salads

257
00:17:57,197 --> 00:18:00,438
just because you're in a hurry to lose weight.

258
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,977
Actually, the kitchen is not as scary as you think.

259
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,817
Every now and then, you can come to the kitchen

260
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,198
and prepare your own favorite dishes.

261
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,938
When your stomach feels warm,

262
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:11,158
so will your life.

263
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:20,117
It's done. What's next?

264
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:21,998
Here.

265
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,858
Watch me.

266
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,778
Start by coring the pears.

267
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,920
Open up.

268
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:58,408
Then, put the pear cubes and the white fungus that we soaked in water into the saucepan.

269
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:01,597
Don't forget, Add two preserved plums.

270
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,838
Then, simmer for two hours, and it's ready.

271
00:19:06,838 --> 00:19:08,318
Okay, it's done.

272
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,197
Mr. Song's class is over. See you tomorrow.

273
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:13,958
- Bye.
- Bye.

274
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:18,017
- Come on.
- Bye.
- Let's arrange the photos.

275
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:55,598
I have something to tell you.

276
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:56,817
After I'm done packing up.

277
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,518
No need for that.

278
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,000
You don't have to come with me.

279
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,900
Don't worry about Huateng.

280
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,600
Although my dad has stepped back and handed over the reins,

281
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,700
he'll still help to keep an eye on things.

282
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,900
Also, I'm thinking about hiring a professional manager.

283
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,600
That way, even if I'm not around,

284
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,800
the company can still operate as usual.

285
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,800
It's not Huateng that I'm worried about.

286
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
I'm worried about you.

287
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Qingchun.

288
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,400
I don't want you to hit pause because of me,

289
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
nor do I want you to be trapped inside the ward

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,600
and waiting every day for something that might never happen.

291
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm not afraid.

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
But it pains me if that happens.

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Let me ask you this.

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Do you still remember your dreams?

295
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,800
None of those matters.

296
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
No.

297
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,700
Those things matter to me.

298
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,000
I always remember

299
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,700
your confidence and charm in front of the cameras,

300
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,000
and the sparkle in your eyes

301
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,800
when you talked about the design of future programs

302
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,100
and your dream of becoming a producer

303
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,000
during the interview.

304
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,800
You gave up all those because of Huateng.

305
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,000
Right now, could you start all over for me?

306
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,900
I gave you my word

307
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,600
that I would fight to live

308
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,000
and you wouldn't suffer.

309
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
But I hope you can promise me one thing.

310
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
When I see you again,

311
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
let me see that you have lived

312
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,400
the life that you always wanted.

313
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
Don't make me feel

314
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,700
like I'm a burden to you.

315
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,700
Okay.

316
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,700
I promise.

317
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I'll wait for you at home.

318
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,910
[MIA]

319
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,600
Look over there.

320
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How will I look in this? Nice?

321
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's beautiful.

322
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,200
That too! That one.

323
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,000
This is my favorite tutu skirt.

324
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
Look at this.

325
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Blue and pink have always been the perfect pair.

326
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,100
I'm sure Director Su will be so surprised

327
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,400
when he gets here.

328
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,300
Hi. May I know who is Miss Cheng?

329
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,200
Me.

330
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
You called to make a reservation yesterday, right?

331
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Please come with me.

332
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
Let's go.

333
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
- Hi, are you Mr. Yan?
- Yes.

334
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,200
- Come with me.
- Let's go.

335
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,800
I like all the gowns.

336
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Do you think this is nice?

337
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,700
It's all nice to me.

338
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,000
I have no idea which one I should go for.

339
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The previous one. That looks nice.

340
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,300
What do you think? Nice, aren't they?

341
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,700
What about this one?

342
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
- This.
- What do you think about this?

343
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll take this.

344
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,800
Okay.

345
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Excuse me.

346
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,700
I'll try this.

347
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,600
Cong Cong.

348
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,800
You're so beautiful.

349
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,600
Not bad.

350
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,800
Sir.

351
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,100
This suit comes together with the wedding dress.

352
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,800
That's perfect.

353
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I'll take the wedding dress too.

354
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,000
I'll take this.

355
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Also, I'll have the matching suit as well.

356
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
I'm sorry.

357
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,200
A customer just tried the matching suit.

358
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,800
He has reserved it.

359
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,000
It's been reserved?

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's right.

361
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,500
A lady just tried the matching wedding dress.

362
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,900
Why don't you try another one?

363
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,200
I want this set. The price is negotiable.

364
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,500
What a coincidence.

365
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,600
That lady said the same thing and offered to buy this suit.

366
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,700
Why don't you talk to her about it?

367
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Where is she now?

368
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Over there.

369
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
Okay. Wait here. I'll take care of it.

370
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,800
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

371
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,600
- You reserved the wedding dress?
- You reserved the suit?

372
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,300
- I did.
- I did.

373
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,900
Why do you want to reserve the suit all of a sudden?

374
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,840
And you?

375
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,070
Why do you want to reserve the wedding dress all of a sudden?

376
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,400
I... None of your business.

377
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,700
Is it because you want to...

378
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:50,477
Since it's you, I won't take the wedding dress then.

379
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:52,600
I'll just take the suit.

380
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,400
Are you thinking about...

381
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,400
What's the matter?

382
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,200
Guess who bought the wedding dress?

383
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
Cheng Qingcong?

384
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,300
How did you know?

385
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,500
Look at the big smile on your face.

386
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,700
Yes!

387
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Look. She's going to propose to me.

388
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,400
She's proposing!

389
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,800
Look. I'm not ready at all.

390
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,700
I don't think it suits you. Take it off.

391
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,000
Take it off! Hurry!

392
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let me try it on.

393
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,800
Let me try it, okay?

394
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,000
Are you saying that he wants to propose to me?

395
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Didn't you figure it out yourself?

396
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Why are you being so shy?

397
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,100
Think about it.

398
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,200
He secretly came here alone to try the suit

399
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,700
and even reserved the matching wedding dress.

400
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,800
What's this if he isn't preparing for a wedding?

401
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,800
But I haven't made up my mind if I want to marry him.

402
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
We haven't been together for that long.

403
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,000
My dream of becoming a professional manager has just begun.

404
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,500
Enough of the PDA.

405
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
Take it.

406
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,800
Since Yan Yuan wants it, I'll let him have it.

407
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,400
I'll only do you the favor this time.

408
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,400
The gentleman next door has tried it on.

409
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Okay.

410
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,600
Look.

411
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
He must think you reserved this wedding dress.

412
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,300
That's why he took the matching suit.

413
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
You can take it.

414
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Consider it a gift from me.

415
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,100
As for my wedding dress, I'll figure out another way.

416
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,400
I'll need your help to set up the wedding venue.

417
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Don't worry.

418
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,900
Leave it to me.

419
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,800
Such a good girl.

420
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
Look.

421
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Take a look!

422
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,700
Take a look!

423
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
I look better in it, right?

424
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,500
Take a look.

425
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,500
Miss Song. Miss Song!

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,200
Here's your parcel.

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
Okay. Thank you.

I've received the USB flash drive. Thank you.

432
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,000
Don't thank me.

433
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,300
I didn't take it for you.

434
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,200
I only took it to negotiate with Chen Han.

435
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,000
I have with me here a newly released video.

436
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It was never announced before this.

you'll believe what I say.

440
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,200
You can really think on your feet.

441
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
I admire that.

442
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,000
I thought it was because I didn't explain the script clearly.

443
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,800
It turns out you brought up a new topic during the latter part of the broadcast

444
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,000
and didn't follow the script just to test me.

445
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,200
No matter what the reason is, you've indeed helped us a lot.

446
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
The reason I'm calling is to say goodbye to you.

Are you leaving Jiangli?

451
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
that I chose to be in this line.

452
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,500
Well, remember

453
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,600
to carry on my dream as you strive forward.

454
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
Okay.

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,100

I really do hate you

460
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
and get envious of you.

461
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,400
But I've never regretted being friends with you.

462
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,800
You might not believe it.

463
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,000
Almost all my laughter and tears

464
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
were shared with you.

465

I never regretted it either.

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,600
Oh, right.

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,800
I haven't congratulated you and Director Su.

and travel around the world together.

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,000
What do you think then?

491
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Are you expecting something else?

492
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Don't tell Director Su about it. We'll do our own thing.

493
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,100
The wedding officially begins!

494
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,100
Let's have the two most important men in the bride's life

495
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,400
perform the sacred ceremony of giving away the bride.

496
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
Let's have the bride enter the hall.

497
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,700
Qingchun.

498
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,700
Zhinian.

499
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
When two people are together,

500
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,600
it's not one plus one equals two.

501
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,400
But two halves form one

502
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,800
to become each other's other half

503
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,600
and form a perfect family.

504
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,000
I believe you'll treat my daughter well.

505
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,100
Zhinian.

506
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,000
I'll hand over my daughter to you today.

507
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,600
From today onward,

508
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,800
I'm not only Qingchun's dad,

509
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,200
but I'm also your dad.

510
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
We'll wait for you to come home.

511
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,600
Thank you, Dad.

512
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I have a few words to say before the bride and groom exchange vows.

513
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Frankly speaking,

514
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,200
I never thought I would be hosting Su Zhinian's wedding.

515
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
After all, for a period of time in the past,

516
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,600
he used to be a rational cold-blooded creature.

517
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,400
Besides me,

518
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
no one can stand his bad temper.

519
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,000
I once thought

520
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,100
that we would live in a nursing home when we grew old.

521
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,000
I'd stand out against him

522
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,600
and be the most popular old man.

523
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,600
But now,

524
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
as you can see, this plan fell through.

525
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
At first,

526
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,600
I was against Mr. Su's choice.

527
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,600
But now, I'm thankful to Miss Song

528
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,100
for coming into his life and enriching it.

529
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,200
Qingchun, know this.

530
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,600
If I were to say that you deserve

531
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,400
all the love Su Zhinian has to offer,

532
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,100
that would be the most sincere blessing that I could come up with.

533
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,600
Legend Su.

534
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,400
You've been through so much.

535
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,900
You finally have a calmer self that's more true to life.

536
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm happy for you.

537
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,100
Really.

538
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Look at your bride.

539
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,000
Take a look at me

540
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,700
who wants to dedicate all the best wishes to you.

541
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
We'll always love you.

542
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,500
All right.

543
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
I'm relieved now.

544
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
I can now pursue my happiness.

545
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,900
Miss Song Qingchun.

546
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,400
Are you willing to become Mr. Su Zhinian's lawfully wedded wife

547
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,500
and become his family

548
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,500
and the reason he lives on?

549
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,000
I do.

550
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Mr. Su Zhinian.

551
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,600
You may now kiss your beautiful bride.

552
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
Wait!

553
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
They haven't exchanged rings yet.

554
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,100
That's right.

555
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000

♫  Let someone take my place  ♫

♫  The encounters we had  ♫

562
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:38,100
♫  is like a heavy downpour drenching my heart.  ♫

563
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,400
♫  A destination not in sight  ♫

564
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,800
♫  Without time accompanying me  ♫

♫  I'm only just passing through your memories  ♫

570
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,600
♫  I so naively thought we'd have eternity  ♫

571
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,000
♫  Let's part ways after giving each other our blessings  ♫

572
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,800
♫  I'm barely just passing through your memories  ♫

573
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,800
♫  But our brief exchange is unforgettable  ♫

574
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,000
♫  What can tear apart our hearts?  ♫

575
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,800
♫  I'll just stop passing through your memories  ♫

576
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,700
♫  There will be a day where I'll stay forever  ♫

577
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,400
♫  Fulfilling my promise without regrets  ♫
