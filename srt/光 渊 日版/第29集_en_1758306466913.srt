00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Hello, a short notice for a comment.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,520
You're late because ofcoca

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,720
I'll leave first.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,020
I'm just...

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,080
You can leave, not you.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,000
A meeting will be held within two hours.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,540
Go.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,540
How long will it take?

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,220
Hello, I'm Mr. Su's assistant, Li Wei Lan.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,220
This is Mr. Su.

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,020
Mr. Su.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,820
Long time no see.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,140
Boss.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,540
This is Yu Bin's student's phone.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,500
Call him immediately.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,940
This...

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,780
Tell him to call me.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,620
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,540
You must tell him to come here.

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,100
Yu Bin took them to the ice and sea bay.

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,300
All the pictures of the bloodline.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,140
What bloodline?

23
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,900
Su Feng told me.

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,580
They're all in the notebook.

25
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,180
Check it yourself.

26
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,780
Go.

27
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,380
Yes.

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,900
Hello.

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Su Feng.

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Su Feng.

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
Su Feng.

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Su Feng.

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Su Feng.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Su Feng.

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Su Feng.

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,780
Su Feng.

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
Su Feng.

38
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,780
Su Feng.

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
Su Feng.

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
Su Feng.

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,780
Su Feng.

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,780
Su Feng.

43
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Su Feng.

44
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
Su Feng.

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
Su Feng.

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
Su Feng.

47
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Su Feng.

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,780
Su Feng.

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,780
Su Feng.

50
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,780
Su Feng.

51
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Su Feng.

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Su Feng.

53
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Su Feng.

54
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,780
Su Feng.

55
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Su Feng.

56
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
Su Feng.

57
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
Su Feng.

58
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Su Feng.

59
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
Su Feng.

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
Su Feng.

61
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Su Feng.

62
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
Su Feng.

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,780
Su Feng.

64
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,780
Su Feng.

65
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Su Feng.

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,780
Su Feng.

67
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
Su Feng.

68
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Su Feng.

69
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,780
Su Feng.

70
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,780
Su Feng.

71
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Su Feng.

72
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Su Feng.

73
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,780
Su Feng.

74
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,780
Su Feng.

75
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Su Feng.

76
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Su Feng.

77
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,780
Su Feng.

78
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
Su Feng.

79
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Su Feng.

80
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,780
Su Feng.

81
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,780
Su Feng.

82
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
Su Feng.

83
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Su Feng.

84
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Su Feng.

85
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Su Feng.

86
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
This is the last one.

87
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
Here, have some water.

88
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Okay.

89
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,780
Thank you.

90
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
The person you asked about

91
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
is probably quite stubborn.

92
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Although our family lives on the island,

93
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
my father

94
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,780
can't remember anything

95
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
about this place.

96
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,780
You said you've always lived on the island.

97
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,780
Have you seen

98
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Zhuo Yingchun?

99
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Dad, have some water.

100
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
On our island,

101
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,780
there seems to be no one like this.

102
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
It was more than ten years ago.

103
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
He was still young at that time.

104
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,780
I guess he doesn't remember.

105
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
I'll go find some other clues.

106
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
Sorry to bother you.

107
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
It's okay.

108
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Dad,

109
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
what did you say?

110
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Little...

111
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Little...

112
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780
Little?

113
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
The person you asked about

114
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
turns out to be Little?

115
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Little?

116
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Little?

117
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
Little?

118
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Little?

119
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,780
Little?

120
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Little?

121
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
Little?

122
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Little?

123
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Little?

124
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Little?

125
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
You can't remember me.

126
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
The case of Zou Feng,

127
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
there's some evidence that needs your cooperation.

128
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
Mrs. Shen.

129
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
Mrs. Shen.

130
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,460
Did you get any result from Mr. Shen's case?

131
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,340
Zou Feng said

132
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,540
he handed all the belongings of Yu Bin to you.

133
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,300
There's an important evidence in it.

134
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,620
Evidence?

135
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,420
The winter when Yu Bin was murdered,

136
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,940
he took his classmates to go abroad to study.

137
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,700
The first night he was about to leave,

138
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,380
a student lost his camera.

139
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,500
So Yu Bin took his classmates to the school.

140
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,340
He was so angry that he took his classmates

141
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
to the school.

142
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,060
He was so angry that he took his classmates

143
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
to the school.

144
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,460
So Yu Bin drove back to the beach alone.

145
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,860
He got into a car with someone.

146
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,020
He bumped into two people who shouldn't be together.

147
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,460
In order to find someone to compensate,

148
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,300
he carefully drew the portrait of the two people.

149
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,660
Zou Feng thinks

150
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,300
this is the reason he was killed by Xu Yi.

151
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,340
Zou Feng said

152
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,780
he handed all the belongings of Yu Bin to you.

153
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,980
Because you were the student

154
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,060
who lost his camera.

155
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,500
I think I should hand it to you personally.

156
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,100
Sorry.

157
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,260
Xiao Hao is used to it.

158
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,780
He never knows what his real name is.

159
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,180
But does he have a son?

160
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,580
He is about my age.

161
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,500
Yes, his name is Yang Bo.

162
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,820
I don't know what his real name is.

163
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,500
But Xiao Hao is quite famous on our island.

164
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,820
He immigrated here.

165
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,580
He married a disabled person on our island as his wife.

166
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,300
But he died in a few days.

167
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,020
After that,

168
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,820
he married a disabled person's cousin.

169
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,540
At that time,

170
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,900
the people on the island always talked nonsense behind his back.

171
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,020
They thought Xiao Hao was a good-looking man.

172
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,620
They liked to wear flower dresses like the female celebrities on TV.

173
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,660
So they gave him this nickname.

174
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,980
Not long after that,

175
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,780
his second husband died.

176
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,940
I heard it was a car accident.

177
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,980
It seems to be quite a big deal.

178
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,780
At that time, people said Xiao Hao was dying.

179
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,340
He took his son and went to the other place.

180
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,420
Do you know where he immigrated from?

181
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,220
How can I know?

182
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,060
It's been decades.

183
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,860
They must not know.

184
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,860
But I heard from the old people on the island that

185
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,260
the person who helped Xiao Hao immigrate here cooperated with the foreign countries.

186
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,180
The people he immigrated to

187
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,260
are all orphans from the welfare center.

188
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,220
Welfare center?

189
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,860
Did he tell the people around him where it was?

190
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,100
For example, the climate and the food of the specialties.

191
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,500
Oh, right.

192
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,100
When Xiao Hao first came here, he was very sharp.

193
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,180
I don't know where he said it.

194
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,780
It's like...

195
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,900
It's like what the foreigners in the news said.

196
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Is it Dongyue?

197
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
Come.

198
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Come.

199
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,860
You want to go down? I'll go down.

200
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,060
Watch. Watch.

201
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Watch.

202
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Let's go.

203
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,060
Everyone, everybody.

204
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,460
Let's do our best.

205
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
The factory is open early today.

206
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,860
Today, all of your annual leave expenses,

207
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,860
I, Zhang Dongyue, will pay for it.

208
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
I'm so angry.

209
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,460
Do you think it's fate or coincidence?

210
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,260
The annual leave of your company is arranged.

211
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,260
This time and this place is like a custom.

212
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,860
President Pei said last year that the annual leave is here.

213
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Tell Pei Su that I love him. I love him to death.

214
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
It's a good thing that it's here.

215
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,860
Otherwise, I'll be fired. I can't catch up.

216
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,660
What's wrong?

217
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Do you not like those?

218
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,060
I...

219
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,660
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.

220
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,660
There's a big surprise waiting for us.

221
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,060
Guess what it is.

222
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,860
What?

223
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,860
A mermaid performance.

224
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
Please look forward to it.

225
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Here it comes.

226
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Please notice that your temporal cortex is good enough is the time and position.

227
00:08:47,060 --> 00:09:04,960
Where's the

228
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
So he arranged a good job for me.

229
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
Did you get it?

230
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,080
Yes.

231
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
The Heng'an welfare center

232
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,720
closed down because the dean disappeared 20 years ago.

233
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,920
But I found an old man in the Heng'an welfare center.

234
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,000
He gave me a picture.

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
Just one picture.

236
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
I don't know if you need it.

237
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay.

238
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,080
Give me the pass.

239
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,640
Right away.

240
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,040
Hello, sir.

241
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm Li Chunsheng.

242
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,600
I brought you the painting.

243
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
Okay, thank you.

244
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
If you have nothing to do, I'll go first.

245
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,400
Okay.

246
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,960
Thank you.

247
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,520
You have to be prepared.

248
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Whoever was in the welfare center

249
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,760
may have serious injuries.

250
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,640
Hello, Yanjia.

251
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Yes.

252
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,800
Hello, Captain Lu.

253
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,000
I found an old man who knew Zhuo Yinchun in the village.

254
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
According to his son's memory,

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,680
Zhuo Yinchun was bought from an foreign welfare center.

256
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Captain Lu.

257
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,600
I suspect Zhuo Yinchun is the same as Su Fei.

258
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
They all came out of the Heng'an welfare center.

259
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,400
Do you think the person behind this

260
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,720
was also an orphan in the Heng'an welfare center?

261
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Boss.

262
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,480
It's Zhang Zhaolin.

263
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
On the night the worries came to hand.

264
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:34,120
So

265
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,920
of the

266
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Chinese police.

267
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
What do you mean?

268
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Mr. Zhang,

269
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
you don't want to tell me,

270
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
you don't know anything, right?

271
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I know.

272
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
You asked me to come

273
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
because of my brother.

274
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Believe it or not,

275
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
these things have nothing to do with me.

276
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
I have my dignity

277
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
in the special investigation team.

278
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
I have my bottom line.

279
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
The matter has developed to today.

280
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
I sit here to cooperate with the investigation.

281
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
It's all because

282
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
because of my brother.

283
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I didn't take good care of him.

284
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
It's my problem to let him make mistakes.

285
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I and Zhao Lin

286
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
are orphans in Heng'an welfare home.

287
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
We were together when we were six or seven years old.

288
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Su Fei was younger.

289
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
But

290
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
he was the longest-serving in the orphanage.

291
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
At that time,

292
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Zhou Ya Hong

293
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
was eager to adopt him.

294
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,880
She was eager to adopt him.

295
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
Hurry, run.

296
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Hurry.

297
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Stop.

298
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Stop.

Stop.

300

Stop.

301
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Stop.

302
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Let me go.

303
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
It's okay.

304
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
Hurry.

305
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Hurry.

306
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Hurry.

You two seem one second away.

No

331
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Let go of me!

332
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Si Bai, don't run!

333
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Zhang Liu!

334
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I told you to run!

335
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Zhang Ji!

336
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Zhang Liu!

337
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Run!

338
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
I told you to run!

339
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I told you to run!

340
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I told you to run!

341
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Hit him!

342
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Hit him!

343
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
From then on,

344
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,280
I thought that although we didn't have blood relations,

345
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
but

346
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
in this lifetime,

347
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
we are all brothers.

348
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
He is your father.

349
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
He is your family.

350
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
What about Huo Xiao and Lao Yang?

351
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
The friendship that lasted for twenty years,

352
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
the comrades who were on the back of each other,

353
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
and the friends who were separated from their families.

354
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
They didn't do anything wrong to you.

355
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
They were killed by your father.

356
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
What were you doing?

357
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
What were you thinking?

358
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Lao Yang,

359
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Xiao Huo,

360
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Lao Yang, Xiao Huo,

361
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
are the people I have the most regret.

362
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I have let them down.

363
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Even if I die,

364
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I don't have the face to see them.

365
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
They are so careful.

366
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I was also so careful.

367
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
I know.

368
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I let you down.

369
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
After Xiao Huo's accident,

370
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
we found Sena He.

371
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Of course I know that Sena He

372
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
is Zhao Lin's property.

373
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
I also know that

374
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
he has a lot of businessmen

375
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
that he can't get on the table.

376
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
But I thought

377
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
that he was a good man.

378
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
But

379
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
I didn't expect

380
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
I didn't expect

381
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
I told you just now.

382
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
You have to believe me.

383
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Sena He is Zhao Lin's property.

384
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
He is Zhao Lin's property.

385
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I don't know

386
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
if you believe me.

387
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Sena He is mine.

388
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
He is not fake.

389
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
But this thing

390
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
has nothing to do with me.

391
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
I am just an entertainment city.

392
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
All the guests are here.

393
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Don't care about Du Guosheng, Li Guosheng.

394
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
You can't just ask them

395
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
if they are wanted criminals.

396
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Brother,

397
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
brother,

398
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
you can't investigate anymore.

399
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
If you investigate,

400
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
I will be the first one to be caught.

401
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Which entertainment city police

402
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,280
doesn't have anything to do with it?

403
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
But this thing has nothing to do with me.

404
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Who knows that his life is so...

405
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Shut up!

406
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Brother,

407
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
you have to let me go.

408
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Don't investigate anymore.

409
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I don't want to compete.

410
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
You went to college.

411
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
You entered SID.

412
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
What about me?

413
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
It's not easy for me to get here.

414
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Can you be like that?

415
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Come back and save me again.

416
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Brother,

417
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
can you?

418
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
I was persuaded by him.

419
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
At that time,

420
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
many people came to me

421
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
to remind me

422
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
not to investigate anymore.

423
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Not to investigate anymore?

424
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
A few dozen years' brother

425
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
can't be compared to a few politicians.

426
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
So that year,

427
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
I was really convinced.

428
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I was convinced.

429
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I was convinced.

430
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
It was indeed Zhang Zhaolin's order

431
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
to kill my brother.

432
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Then destroy the city,

433
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
and create a fire.

434
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Stop SID from investigating

435
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
along this line.

436
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:14,420
Then pass on the old

437
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
wanted criminal.

438
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
It's a trap.

439
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
If there is no old lady

440
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
of that country,

441
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
that wanted criminal will also attack the passers-by.

442
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Nothing is better than

443
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
an old man

444
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
who is full of ideas and is righteous.

445
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
It's easier to plot.

446
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Right?

447
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I failed Lao Yang.

448
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
You not only failed him,

449
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
but also failed his wife and children.

450
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
One of them died in an unknown way.

451
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
One was blinded by hatred

452
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
and became a murderer.

453
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
He could have not died.

454
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
But he was still alive.

455
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
He was still alive.

456
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
He was still alive.

457
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
He could have not died.

458
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
His family

459
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
didn't have to be destroyed.

460
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
From the beginning,

461
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
you said you didn't know

462
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
what you did to Zhang Zhaolin.

463
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
He was a wanted criminal

464
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
in Sena River.

465
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
You didn't know.

466
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
He framed Huo Xiao.

467
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
You didn't know.

468
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
He set up a trap to kill Lao Yang.

469
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
You didn't know.

470
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Then what about the truth behind him?

471
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
In order to get the position

472
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
of SID leader in FUNIAN,

473
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
did you know

474
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
the answers he got?

475
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I didn't know.

476
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
I've heard more than once

477
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
such rumors.

478
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
They said you were lucky

479
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
when you were young.

480
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
You could even meet a wanted criminal

481
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
when you went out to buy food.

482
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I never doubted you.

483
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Even if Fan Siyuan

484
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
pushed the evidence in front of me,

485
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I didn't have it.

486
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Especially because you were my master

487
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
and teacher.

488
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
It's because I still remember

489
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
the day I was interviewed.

490
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
You lied.

491
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
It was the effort of our two generations

492
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
that made SID

493
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
the light of the new state.

494
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Don't let your own will

495
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
take away the effort

496
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
of the people in your heart.

497
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
You not only failed Lao Yang,

498
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
but also Huo Xiao.

499
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
You failed

500
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
to get yourself into the bottom.

501
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

502
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

503
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

504
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

505
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

506
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

507
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

508
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

509
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

510
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

511
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

512
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

513
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

514
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

515
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

516
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

517
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

518
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

519
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

520
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
You failed to get yourself into the bottom.

521
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Act.

522
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Act.

523
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Boss.

524
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
We found his passport and ticket

525
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
in Zhang Zhaolin's study.

526
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
We found his passport and ticket

527
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
The ticket was at eight o'clock in the evening.

528
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Why didn't he run away?

529
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Something very important must have happened.

530
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Something very important must have happened.

531
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Something very important must have happened.

532
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
He ruined his plan.

533
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
He ruined his plan.

534
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
Retreat.

535
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Yes.

536
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Chief.

537
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
You came at the right time.

538
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Zhang Zhaolin ran away.

539
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Everyone, pay attention.

540
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
All the city gates are closed.

541
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
All the city gates are closed.

542
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Yes.

543
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Chief.

544
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
What task do you have for us next?

545
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
I want to know

546
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
what task you have for us next.

547
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
What task you have for us next?

548
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
What task you have for us next?

549
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
What task you have for us next?

550
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Now the black-handed has been found.

551
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,280
This case is closely related to the special investigation team.

552
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
The rest of the case

553
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
will be handed over to the surveillance team.

554
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Hand over?

555
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Isn't the person in the surveillance team always there?

556
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Chief.

557
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Chief.

558
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Whether I'm responsible or not,

559
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
I will listen to the organization's arrangement.

560
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
But there are some things I have to ask you.

561
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
You also suspect Zhang Zhaolin.

562
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
You and Chief Luo have been monitoring him.

563
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
How did he escape from your eyes?

564
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
We don't know.

565
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
The person in the surveillance team

566
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
is a member of the surveillance team.

567
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
We don't know.

568
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
You two,

569
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
take them outside.

570
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Yes.

571
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Wei Zhao.

572
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
You and Chief Luo.

573
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
When did you start working together?

574
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Chief.

575
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Thank you.

576
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
You came out of the investigation team.

577
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
You were taken away from the investigation.

578
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
The person who informed you about the body-shedding case

579
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
is him, right?

580
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
It should be earlier.

581
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
The person who agreed to restart the second 0-degree plan

582
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
is also him, right?

583
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
And

584
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
this is an anonymous report.

585
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Those reports

586
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
are given to you by Chief Luo, right?

587
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
You have already noticed

588
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
the existence of the organization and the suspect from the beginning.

589
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
In recent years,

590
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Zhang Zhaolin and his team

591
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
have been controlling the 0-degree accomplice

592
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
and committed several serial murders.

593
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
The surveillance team has noticed that

594
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
every time the SID intervenes,

595
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
they do nothing.

596
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Chief Luo has to suspect

597
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
that there is something wrong with the SID.

598
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
The SID has a problem.

599
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
The Zhang Shouqianlian has withdrawn

600
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
from the He Zongyi case.

601
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Chief Luo thinks

602
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
that since the cleaners have a plan,

603
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
he will take the opportunity

604
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
to set up this plan.

605
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Then why didn't you tell me?

606
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Why didn't you tell me

607
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
when I suspected you?

608
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
Am I unreliable

609
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
or are you suspecting me too?

610
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Wei Zhao,

611
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
you have been working hard these days.

612
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Go back and have a good rest.

613
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Du Du,

614
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
I don't care why the organization

615
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
didn't believe me before.

616
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
But before I get

617
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
the action tonight,

618
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I will not leave.

619
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Du Du,

620
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
you are just doing whatever you want.

621
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Once Zhang Zhaolin

622
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
is caught by the SID,

623
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
he who succeeds in revenge

624
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
will probably take the remains

625
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
of the cleaners

626
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
and sink into the ground forever.

627
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
So you should

628
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
go back and have a good rest.

629
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
I will go back and have a good rest.

630
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I will go back and have a good rest.

631
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
So you deliberately

632
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
let Zhang Zhaolin go.

633
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
You want to use Zhang Zhaolin

634
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
to overthrow the SID.

635
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
But

636
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
you want to

637
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
pull off

638
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
the two sides of the power chain without any hesitation.

639
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
You still have a chance

640
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
to get a chance.

641
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
So Du Du,

642
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
you...

643
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
I will go back and have a good rest.

644
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Let's ask Mr. Pei

645
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
to go back and cooperate with the investigation.

646
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
I will go back and have a good rest.

647
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
You don't go.

648
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
It's too late, Senior.

649
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
If the cleaners

650
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
completely clean up the organization,

651
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
sink into the ground, disappear and disappear,

652
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
everything will be too late.

653
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Why do you have to

654
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
put in all your effort

655
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
to join the re-establishment plan?

656
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
What did you talk to Du Zu?

657
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
There is a new lead

658
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
who is the first to establish the plan.

659
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
How did you know about Zou Feng's case?

660
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
I knew that

661
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
I had already

662
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
figured out the key to the plan.

663
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
What is Pei Song doing in the nose?

664
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
In fact, the organization has already

665
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
figured out the hidden truth.

666
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
But if they

667
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
try to make a new plan again,

668
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
they will only kneel on the ground and beg for the truth.

669
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Then they will have a chance to break their wings.

670
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Did someone contact you?

671
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
The cleaners or the organization?

672
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
I asked you to tell me something before.

673
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
What is it?

674
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I didn't tell you.

675
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
But now

676
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
I have to go to the inside.

677
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Since they asked me to stay silent,

678
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I will go to the procurator's office now

679
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
to be the safest.

680
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
We should believe that Du Zu and Lu Chacha

681
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
are both dead.

682
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Pei Song is the bait this time.

683
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
The Procurator's Office

684
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Du Zu.

685
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Thank you for your protection.

686
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
Thank you.

687
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Did Mr. Su from our company

688
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
contact you obediently?

689
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
Now

690
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
can I

691
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
gain full trust?

692
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Su Cheng has already taken the initiative

693
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
to explain all the operating routes

694
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
of Guangyao Fund.

695
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
As you said,

696
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
there is direct evidence

697
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
that Zhang Zhaolin has been

698
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
committing all illegal crimes for years.

699
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
This also involves

700
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
your father,

701
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Pei Cheng Yu.

702
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Du Zu.

703
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
I don't need to worry about you.

704
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Since the first call

705
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
between you and me,

706
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
I have already thought about

707
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
all the consequences.

708
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
I will go now.

709
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Du Zu.

710
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
I am Pei Song.

711
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
I am here to cooperate with you.

712
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
I think you have always wanted to

713
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,280
separate the organization from the perpetrators.

714
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Luozhao

715
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
is a nagging person.

716
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
But he has taught me a lot of things.

717
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
The most important thing is

718
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
that anyone

719
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
will be judged

720
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
for any illegal behavior.

721
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
And this judge

722
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
is only a law.

723
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
When I called you

724
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
on the first call,

725
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
I have already thought about it.

726
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
No matter who it involves,

727
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
in the past 30 years,

728
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I am willing to

729
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
hand over

730
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
all the grudges and disputes

731
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
between the two of you

732
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
and the procurator Lu.

733
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I will hand them over to the legal judge.

734
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Du Zu.

735
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Can I know now

736
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
that since Zhang Zhaolin

737
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
has been exposed,

738
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
what should we do next?

739
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Zhang Zhaolin

740
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
has been exposed.

741
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
As soon as he moves,

742
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
we will arrest him immediately.

743
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
What about Fan Siyuan?

744
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Fan Siyuan has been hiding

745
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
quite a lot.

746
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
He has not been exposed.

747
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Although your memory is effective,

748
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
you cannot use it as a direct evidence.

749
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
So we have to wait

750
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
for Fan Siyuan.

751
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
No.

752
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
I have to go.

753
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
I have to go.

754
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
I have to go.

755
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
We have to wait

756
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
for Fan Siyuan.

757
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
No.

758
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Why?

759
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Du Zu.

760
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Although you think

761
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
you know Fan Siyuan earlier,

762
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
but since he started killing people,

763
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
he has changed.

764
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
He is no longer

765
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
the professor of the old Longzhi Hospital.

766
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
He is now like Zhang Zhaolin.

767
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
He is a devil.

768
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
And there is a group of people

769
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
around this devil

770
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
who are more bitter than hatred,

771
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
hard to talk, soft to heart,

772
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
and hard to learn.

773
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Once they escape

774
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
and sink into the underground,

775
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
these little people

776
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
will be the permanent bombs

777
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
buried in Xinzhou's underground forever.

778
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
What do you think?

779
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
We have to take the initiative

780
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
to turn the situation around.

781
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
What plan?

782
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
The best way now is

783
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
to let Zhang Zhaolin go for now.

784
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Then use Zhang Donglan

785
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
to be the bait.

786
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Then let Fan Siyuan

787
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
be the bait.

788
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
And we

789
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
will be the yellow birds

790
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
behind them.

791
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Zhang Zhaolin

792
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
is a cold-blooded monster

793
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
who is completely out of control.

794
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
In this world,

795
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
except for himself,

796
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
he doesn't care about anything.

797
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Except for one person.

798
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
The successor of the dark empire he established,

799
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
his son, Zhang Donglan.

800
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Now everything is ready,

801
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
just wait for the prey to be hooked.

802
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,280
The night I'm still

803
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,280
and waiting in the silence

804
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
until you come

805
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,280
and settle well with me

806
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,280
You raise me up

807
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,280
so I can stand on my own feet

808
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,280
You raise me up

809
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,280
to welcome something sweet

810
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,280
And I'm strong

811
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,280
when there's hope in your touch

812
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

813
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Hello.

814
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
I was just thinking

815
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
when you would call me.

816
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
You really can take it.

817
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
You came out from the investigation team?

818
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Yes.

819
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Thanks to Mr. Su.

820
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
The company is so big.

821
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
I'm in the second team.

822
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Usually it's all thanks to him.

823
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Now something happened.

824
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
He ran into Mr. Yu.

825
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
I lost my suspicion.

826
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
What do you want?

827
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Pei Cheng Yu once told me

828
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
he had a ship

829
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
and wanted to give me the knife.

830
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Although he may not remember it,

831
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I'm thinking

832
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
it's something personal.

833
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
I'll take it back.

834
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
You're really Pei Cheng Yu's son.

835
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,280
You're really Pei Cheng Yu's son.

836
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
You two are so close.

837
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
You're both greedy and vicious.

838
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
How can you say that?

839
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I'm better than

840
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
that useless Pei Cheng Yu.

841
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
I have a special team.

842
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
And I have a good relationship

843
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
with Mr. Lin.

844
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I don't care about

845
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
your relationship with Pei Cheng Yu.

846
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,280
What do you think?

847
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
Am I an ideal

848
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
partner?

849
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
No.

850
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
My requirements are not high.

851
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
I just need a little loyalty.

852
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
I don't need to

853
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,760
be a

854
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
loyal and righteous person.

855
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
What can I gain

856
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
from this?

857
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Mr. Zhang,

858
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
you should have

859
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
a good experience

860
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
about this.

861
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Fan Si Yuan,

862
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
that old man,

863
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
we didn't expect

864
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
that he would

865
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
take advantage of you

866
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,280
in this game.

867
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Alright.

868
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,280
You'd better

869
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,280
worry about yourself.

870
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Money,

871
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,280
brotherhood,

872
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
reputation,

873
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,280
status,

874
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
all of them are gone.

875
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Mr. Zhang,

876
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
are you willing to

877
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
hide from the world

878
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
and live alone

879
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
from now on,

880
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
or

881
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,280
are you willing

882
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
to listen to me

883
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
and let me take care of you

884
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
and those who

885
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
are capable

886
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
in your hands?

887
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
I'm willing to.

888
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
After all,

889
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
I have a good relationship

890
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
with Dong Lan.

891
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,280
I'm not willing

892
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
to see him sad.

893
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
How do I know

894
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
you didn't cheat?

895
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
Mr. Zhang,

896
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
you don't

897
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
let me cheat anymore.

898
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
To be honest,

899
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
you used to

900
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
hide behind the scenes

901
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
and save the country.

902
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Now,

903
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
you're sharing

904
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,280
a lost country.

905
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
And Dong Lan is in my hands.

906
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,280
If you can give up,

907
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,280
you should be

908
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,280
on the plane to Dong Yue.

909
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
I've heard it.

910
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,280
If Dong Lan

911
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
is not on the right track,

912
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,280
you'll be in trouble.

913
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
I'll send someone

914
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
to pick you up.

915
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Mr. Pei,

916
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
don't you dare come.

917
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Mr. Du.

918
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
Mr. Du.

919
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,280
Can you

920
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
do me a small favor?

921
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Can you

922
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
not tell them

923
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
about our plan?

924
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Although

925
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
it seems like

926
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
it's a perfect plan,

927
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,280
I'm afraid

928
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,280
it's not the right time

929
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,280
to tell them.

930
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
But there's a small problem.

931
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,280
I might not

932
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
come back alive.

933
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
I'm sorry.

934
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
I'm sorry.

935
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
I'm sorry.

937
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
I'm sorry.

938
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
I'm sorry.

939
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
I'm sorry.

940
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
I'm sorry.

941
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
I'm sorry.

942
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
I'm sorry.

943
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
I'm sorry.

944
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
I'm sorry.

945
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
I'm sorry.

946
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,280
I'm sorry.

947
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
I'm sorry.

948
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
I'm sorry.

949
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
I'm sorry.

950
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,280
I'm sorry.

951
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
I'm sorry.

952
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,280
I'm sorry.

953
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
I'm sorry.

954
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
I'm sorry.

955
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I'm sorry.

956
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
I'm sorry.

957
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,280
I'm sorry.

958
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,280
I'm sorry.

959
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I'm sorry.

960
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
I'm sorry.

961
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
I'm sorry.

962
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,280
Boss, we found the location of Pei Su.

963
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,280
He's in the airport.

964
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Where is he?

965
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
The location hasn't changed.

966
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
The location hasn't changed.

967
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
I'm sorry.

968
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
I'm sorry.

969
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
Boss.

970
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,440
Mr. Zhang, everyone is already much better

971
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,840
I Allison's fact

972
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:28,440
and there are nools

973
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,080
The person in the big room died early.

974
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,360
Search your men for a while.

975
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,720
I've been gone for too long.

976
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,560
The people in the East and the South might be worried.

977
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,240
Something might happen

978
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,160
that no one is willing to see.

979
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,640
Pei Su, don't push too hard.

980
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,400
Let him go.

981
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,720
One hour?

982
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,920
If you don't show up,

983
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,880
I'm afraid it's too late.

984
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,600
Take him away.

985
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,120
Go up.

986
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,040
We meet again,

987
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,400
Mr. Pei.

988
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,520
Go.

989
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,680
Captain Lu, we got it.

990
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,640
The tracking device used by the Du family

991
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,280
is the latest technology.

992
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,360
Once it's connected to the air,

993
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,320
it will record sound and send it back to the cloud.

994
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,480
Hello?

995
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,680
Mr. Zhang.

996
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,880
Long time no see.

997
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,160
Fan Siyuan?

998
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,680
It's him.

999
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,320
You still remember me?

1000
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,400
You have Pei Su?

1001
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,000
For the truth,

1002
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,720
I've been waiting for ten years.

1003
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,720
Now it's finally the end.

1004
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,320
All wisdom in the world

1005
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,160
is about waiting and hope.

1006
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,760
Patience and hope

1007
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,920
are the driving force

1008
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,440
for the future.

1009
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,560
They can surely

1010
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,720
bring the dawn of dawn.

1011
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,040
You still like to pretend to be a god?

1012
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,000
Tell me where you are.

1013
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,240
The beginning

1014
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,600
is the end.

1015
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,920
What does it mean?

1016
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,920
Where is the beginning?

1017
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,080
Could it be Sena and Youan?

1018
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,360
Didn't Mr. Pei say

1019
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,120
Fan Siyuan wants to kill people with ceremony?

1020
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,200
He even wants to take revenge on Zhang Zu

1021
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,840
with a gold bar worth 500,000 yuan.

1022
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,440
Does he want to burn Zhang Zhaolin

1023
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,960
to death in Sena River?

1024
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,160
I'll take him to Sena River.

1025
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,520
He's not there.

1026
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,160
Why?

1027
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,080
He's taking revenge on Zhang Zhaolin.

1028
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
It's impossible

1029
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,480
to reveal his location to the third party.

1030
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,480
It should be a place

1031
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,880
only he and Zhang Zhaolin know.

1032
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,480
Then where is he?

1033
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,560
Mr. Fang.

1034
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,960
So wild.

1035
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,720
Mr. Fang.

1036
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,920
Your friend

1037
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,040
has been attacking me all the way.

1038
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,760
I think

1039
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,240
this is not the attitude

1040
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,680
of the most intimate partner.

1041
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,680
Let's go.

1042
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,120
Long time no see.

1043
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,160
Good boy.

1044
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1045
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1046
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1047
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1048
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1049
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1050
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1051
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1052
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1053
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1054
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1055
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1056
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1057
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1058
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1059
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1060
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1061
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1062
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1063
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1064
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1065
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1066
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1067
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1068
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1069
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1070
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1071
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

1072
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,840
I dare to come back to the color in the dream.

1073
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,840
No matter right or wrong, I'm just a fly.

1074
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
Just go forward.

1075
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Just go forward.

1076
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,840
I'm the only one with a wound.

1077
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
The wind in the dark night,

1078
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,840
I'm the only one who doesn't know.

1079
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,840
Keep going forward.

1080
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Keep going forward.

1081
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,840
The lost step.

1082
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,840
The silent silence.

1083
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,840
In the silence.

1084
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,840
I'm willing to be with you.

1085
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,840
The End
