1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm...

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
You must be Dong Xiaoqing.

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,960
Hello.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,920
I'm...

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,960
You're from the Special Investigation Team.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,240
You've been entrusted by the Zhou family, right?

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:44,920
What?

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,000
You came to interrogate me

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,600
because you couldn't find out my father's evidence of murder?

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,840
I just know some things.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,280
The driver Dong Xian

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,240
usually takes such heavy tasks.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
As far as I know,

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
no one in our family is in debt.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,680
No one has a terminal illness.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,960
My father is not a bad drug dealer who can't afford to pay back the money.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,480
We're poor,

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,880
but we're doing fine.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,760
We won't kill people for money.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,400
Dad.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,280
My father had an accident.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,120
It's his fault and his responsibility.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,440
I can take the responsibility for the money.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,360
But I can borrow it.

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,200
I'll pay it back even if I have to be a cow or a horse.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,920
But you can't slander him.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,520
He's dead.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,960
He has no more excuses for himself.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,920
You have to take the risk and eat steamed buns.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,800
Because you are out to game?

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,560
Are you on the Oraaaaa team?

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,040
Please don't do that to me.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,480
My mom is a chauffeur wholink that time.

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,960
My dad lies in this business for one year.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,400
Hardly he 조� hard to restore the steering steel.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Once...

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,460
OK, OK.

38
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,620
Take care of your usual business.

39
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
Attention, guys.

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,680
Next, I'm going to thank you

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,360
the candidate for the drunken war

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,560
What's wrong?

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Lost your way?

44
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Go to hell!

45
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,760
Go!

46
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,360
The kidnapper posted a video on social media this morning.

47
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,360
According to the video, the victim is Zhou Huaijing, the son of Zhou Junhao,

48
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,360
the well-known entrepreneur who died in a car accident yesterday.

49
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Help. Help.

50
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,360
The special investigation team will intervene in the Zhou's case.

51
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
We have contacted the online center to delete the video.

52
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
But it's been two hours since the first video was released.

53
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
It's probably full of storm outside.

54
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Can the publisher's IP be used?

55
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
They used a large number of network agents.

56
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
The witnesses are still checking.

57
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Did you check Zhou Huaijing's whereabouts?

58
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Yes.

59
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,360
At 2 a.m., she arrived in Xinzhou by the XU586 flight.

60
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
After landing, she sent a message to her family saying that she had already arrived at the hotel.

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
She said that she didn't need to be in a hurry.

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
It's said that she can arrive in half an hour, at most 40 minutes.

63
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
But the hotel's rent was two hours, and there was no news.

64
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
When she called again, her phone was turned off.

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
This is Zhou Huaijing's schedule.

66
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Isn't Zhou Huaijing a young master who is responsible for the security guard?

67
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
How could she leave the airport in the middle of the night?

68
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Zhou Huaijing is like that.

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
She is very humble and takes good care of people.

70
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Although some people say that she is too gentle and lacks strength,

71
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,360
her consideration of the security guard is always good.

72
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,360
She went home in the middle of the night to disturb the rest of the staff and the security guard.

73
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
She is indeed a good person.

74
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Let's go, Captain Luo.

75
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Boss, the internet has already reported that Zhou Huaijing is a criminal.

76
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
The internet is now exploding.

77
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,360
They are pushing all kinds of information related to Zhou Group.

78
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,360
All the subsidiaries under Zhou Group's company are falling.

79
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Now the stock market has become a frenzy of empty-headed people.

80
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
It's really scary.

81
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Let's ignore this first.

82
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
How is Zhou Huaijing's phone positioning?

83
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
No news yet.

84
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Xiao Wu, call the security guard to help Tao Ze speed up.

85
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Yes.

86
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
From now on, block the scene.

87
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
No relevant personnel should enter Zhou's house at will.

88
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
It's not easy to leak the news now.

89
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Yes.

90
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
The two generations of Zhou family are in trouble.

91
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
It's impossible to let them escape.

92
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Arrange Xiao Gan Yang to continue to track down the suspect.

93
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Tell them to dig deeper.

94
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Don't just listen to Dong Xian's daughter's side-by-side.

95
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Understood.

96
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
I understand.

97
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Don't worry.

98
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
We've been digging.

99
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
We've been digging.

100
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
But the other party is also constantly uploading.

101
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
What the hell are these kidnappers doing?

102
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
They don't want money or their lives.

103
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
They don't contact their victims' families at once.

104
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
They just put the video online for speculation.

105
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Zhou Huaijing is a low-key rich second generation.

106
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
She has never been out.

107
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Ordinary citizens know stars and important people.

108
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,360
But who knows what an adult living in a foreign country looks like?

109
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Then this video of less than a minute.

110
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
How did it attract so many people's attention?

111
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Do you think we're still here?

112
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Someone's pushing us back on purpose.

113
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Captain Luo.

114
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Shouldn't I be a little further away from the situation?

115
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
What?

116
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
They caught the car accident yesterday and are on leave today.

117
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Such a sensitive time, such a sensitive world.

118
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
They still want nothing but profit.

119
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
the new army

120
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
and also want to take advantage of

121
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
the capitalists who are

122
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,360
in the hands of Zhou's

123
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
For example, I am Wei Chi Liu

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
I need to know now

125
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
who is likely to participate in the project

126
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Give me a list

127
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
I can give you some I'm familiar with

128
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
But you have to know

129
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Now all people in Xinzhou

130
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
are looking for a chance to invest

131
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
I don't mention the retail

132
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Just call the institutions in this world

133
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
I don't know how many

134
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm not a god, everyone knows

135
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Then add another clue

136
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,220
From the earliest video to the

137
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,360
entire network

138
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
It took less than half an hour

139
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
This operation

140
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
seems to have a very mature model

141
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
It's not the first time

142
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
that the back-up is doing this kind of thing

143
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
And it's very likely

144
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
It's a competitive relationship

145
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
with Zhou's

146
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Then there are no two left

147
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
By the way, as a suspect

148
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I still want to give you a suggestion

149
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
The warning reference is not necessarily right

150
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
I guess

151
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Although the kidnapper and the back-up

152
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
have a certain relationship

153
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
But the kidnapper may not be the back-up

154
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Brother Wu

155
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
You finally came

156
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Don't worry

157
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Brother Wu is missing

158
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Come

159
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
What should I do

160
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Sit down and talk slowly

161
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
I said my dad was killed

162
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Now my brother is not here

163
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I don't know what to do

164
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
I don't know what to do

165
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
I didn't want to kill him

166
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Now my brother is gone

167
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Our Zhou family is dead

168
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Some people are happy, right?

169
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Medicine

170
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Hurry up

171
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I

172
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I

173
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
This man is Wu Sheng Yu

174
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
The chief physician of Zhou Group

175
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
He is responsible for the marketing of the brand

176
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
And the channels that happen outside

177
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
He is Zhou Bojing's college classmate

178
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
He has a high position in the company

179
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Brother Wu, where is Zheng Kaifeng?

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Why didn't he come when dad was in trouble?

181
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Is it because of Yang Mo, the bastard?

182
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Huai Xing, am I wrong?

183
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
It must be because of that bastard

184
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Don't think you can hide me in the valley

185
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
That bastard

186
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
has been in a bad mood for a long time

187
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
He even killed my dad and my brother

188
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
He can bully me

189
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
a person who doesn't know anything, right?

190
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Even Uncle Zheng is scared now

191
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Zheng Kaifeng is the one who followed Zhou Juhao

192
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
to ride the white-handed old man

193
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Zhou Shi's second hand

194
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
It's him who raised Yang Bo

195
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
No, Yang Bo

196
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
He is the illegitimate son of the rumored person

197
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
You know Zhou Shi well

198
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
He is the person in charge of the meeting

199
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
I'll take you to investigate

200
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
It's very likely that there is a video of the withdrawal

201
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
After the investigation, cut the video

202
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Yes

203
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Officer, Huai Xing is younger

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Such a big thing happened at home

205
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
He is under a lot of pressure

206
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Emotion is out of control

207
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
So don't listen to his nonsense

208
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
I'm not talking nonsense

209
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Bastard

210
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Mr. Wu

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Since there is a kidnapping or a murder

212
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
It's a criminal case

213
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Whether it's a family matter or something else

214
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
It's all important information

215
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Hiding important information is a criminal responsibility

216
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
I hope you can understand the nature of this matter

217
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
I understand all these

218
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Mr. Zheng, I believe

219
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,360
all the directors know

220
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
He is the center of our group

221
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
As for Mr. Yang

222
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Mr. Yang Bo, he is the secret of the group

223
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Usually

224
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Too outspoken

225
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
So it's inevitable to invite some

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Bad rumors

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
To Huai Xing's ears

228
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
In addition, Mr. Yang is the kind of

229
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Typical child of someone else

230
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
When Zhou is alive

231
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Often use him to teach Huai Xing

232
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
So they have a bad relationship

233
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
But you have to say he really

234
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Will hurt Zhou and Mr. Zhou

235
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I absolutely don't believe

236
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
These days, they have been

237
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Checking out the island

238
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
I rushed over as soon as I heard the news

239
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Please help your agent at the airport

240
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Really can't have another person

241
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Boss, I found the phone case

242
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Where is it in the White Sand River

243
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
White Sand River

244
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Will my brother be

245
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
In the city river

246
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Found it

247
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
We tracked Zhou Huai Xing's phone

248
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Found this taxi

249
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
It was like this when it came

250
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Haven't moved yet

251
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
There is a smell of mold in the car

252
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Zhou Huai Xing's bag is in the car

253
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
The real phone wallet has never been touched

254
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Tao Zi, stop

255
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
This place

256
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Should be Zhou Huai Jing's struggle

257
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Traces left

258
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
According to this direction

259
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Zhou Huai Jing should be the father

260
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Suddenly someone behind him

261
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Zhou Huai Jing struggled

262
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Then the blood left in the front

263
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
So the driver is the one who helped Pei

264
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Follow the number of the car

265
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Check the driver

266
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Let the inspection team help

267
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Keep looking

268
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
All cameras

269
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Find suspicious vehicles

270
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
it is good

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
What happened

272
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Someone is taking pictures, I'll deal with it

273
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
It's okay

274
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Don't shoot

275
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Communicate with the media

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Must keep it secret

277
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Boss, look

278
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
What's wrong with your friend

279
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
You see it yourself

280
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
There is a wound on the car

281
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Don't come

282
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Why is the video gone

283
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Brother Hu, will my brother die

284
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Brother

285
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Huai Xing

286
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Huai Xing

287
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
What's wrong with you

288
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Huai Xing

289
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Huai Xing

290
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Huai Xing

291
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Boss

292
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Is the video still on the Internet?

293
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Huai Xing

294
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Huai Xing

295
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Sir, you can't go in

296
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
We are investigating

297
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
You can't go in

298
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Sir, thank you

299
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
Hello, sir

300
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Catch this bastard

301
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
He is a murderer

302
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,360
He is shameless, he dares to come to our house

303
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Catch him

304
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
You want to play the wild dog vaccine

305
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Or the real-time record

306
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Boss

307
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
I am Zhou Lao's assistant

308
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
And the board secretary of the board

309
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
My name is Yang Bo

310
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
I was inspecting the new port in Lidao yesterday

311
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
I rushed back when I knew something happened

312
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
On the way back

313
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
I heard from Brother Huai Jing

314
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Sorry, it's too sudden

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
I'm a little

316
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm sorry

317
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm sorry

318
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm sorry

319
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
I'm a little

320
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
I really don't know what to do

321
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Mr. Yang

322
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,360
To understand the case

323
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I won't go around with you

324
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
There is a rumor that you and Zhou Lao are father and son

325
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
What are you talking about

326
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
This is all nonsense

327
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
This is my personal ability

328
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
My mother, Zhou Lao, the insult of three people

329
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I don't know where you heard these rumors

330
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
I think you

331
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
I don't deserve you

332
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Zhou Huai Jing was kidnapped in Xinzhou

333
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Those with a bad relationship are suspected

334
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Including my uncle

335
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,360
What? I'm a suspect

336
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you sick?

337
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Are you blind?

338
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Is that how you SIDs do things?

339
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm the client

340
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I want to change people

341
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Sorry

342
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
We are a special investigation team

343
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
Not refunded

344
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Pei Ye

345
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
What's wrong with this person?

346
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
He said I was a suspect

347
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,360
I want to complain to him

348
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Brother Zhou, don't be so serious with him

349
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Calm down

350
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
My mother and Zhou Lao are indeed old acquaintances

351
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I am also because of this relationship

352
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm lucky to work in Zhou's

353
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
But I got to this position

354
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
It's all because of my personal ability

355
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
You really have the face to say

356
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
You are the master of the car accident

357
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
I don't understand

358
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
For people like you

359
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
What is the standard of the bad relationship?

360
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
You are a scumbag

361
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
How dare you insult me?

362
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Captain Luo

363
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Captain Du

364
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
What's wrong with you?

365
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
It's not like this

366
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
It's like letting the criminals hold their noses

367
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Delete it

368
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Wang Fei really did it

369
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
That's equal to treating the hostage

370
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
As a very dangerous place

371
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
How are you preparing now?

372
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Think of a plan and report to me

373
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
If it's me, I'll delete it

374
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
What?

375
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
Don't believe me?

376
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Forget it

377
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Did you come here to drink tea?

378
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
You are not suitable for the investigation

379
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
You are not suitable for the investigation

380
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
You are not suitable for the investigation

381
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
The smell of your identity

382
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Change it for me

383
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Let's go

384
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Tell me your logic

385
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Look here

386
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Wang Fei first slipped

387
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Then he stood on the bloodstain

388
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Don't you think this action is too particular for a kidnapper?

389
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,360
It's a bit of a multi-sense

390
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
So what?

391
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
So I think the kidnapper doesn't want to hurt Zhou Huai Jing at all

392
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,360
He may just want to exchange some kind of stuff with the hostage

393
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
But he doesn't want to become a wanted criminal

394
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
And from the kidnapper's attitude towards the hostage

395
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
He is very likely to have only one enemy

396
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,360
So

397
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Even if you delete the video

398
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Maybe they won't be able to find the murderer

399
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Boss, there is a new video

400
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
What do you want?

401
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
You

402
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
You

403
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
You

404
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
You

405
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Brother Wu, I'll pay

406
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Let's go to the Black City

407
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
How much money is fine

408
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
As long as I can get up, my brother can be saved

409
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Okay, calm down

410
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Calm down

411
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Your brother will be fine

412
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
You

413
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I

414
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,360
I ask you questions

415
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
You

416
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Within ten minutes

417
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Answer

418
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
You have to put it on the list

419
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
of the most important and most magnanimous

420
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
I already know the answer

421
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
If you dare to lie

422
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
I'll

423
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
I'll

424
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
I'll cut a piece of the whole thing

425
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
into pieces

426
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
There is no way

427
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Huixing

428
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Let's

429
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
cut someone's life

430
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
The first question

431
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Zhou Junhao

432
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Is he

433
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
A leader of the two sides

434
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Is he

435
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
A person who

436
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Sliced the dead life

437
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Without hesitation

438
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
And became

439
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
A hostage

440
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
You

441
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
This

442
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
This

443
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Is it

444
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Is it

445
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
You

446
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
You

447
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
My brother will die

448
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Ten minutes

449
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Ten minutes

450
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Ten minutes

451
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
Hello

452
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
About the online rumors

453
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
We have no notice

454
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Hello, who are you

455
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
That's a complete notice

456
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
You don't believe me

457
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
I swear

458
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
The board will have questions

459
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Let them call me directly

460
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
I'll explain

461
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Brother Wu

462
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Send an announcement to them immediately

463
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
That DNA is real

464
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
It was my brother's

465
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Secretly looking for someone to do it

466
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
I saw it a while ago

467
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Yes, it is

468
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
That DNA report is real

469
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
The one who hid it is that

470
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Beautiful dead life

471
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
If something happens to my brother today

472
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
I'll kill you first

473
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
I'll kill you first

474
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I'll kill you first

475
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
I'll kill you first

476
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
I'll kill you first

477
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
I'll kill you first

478
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
I'll kill you first

479
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
I'll kill you first

480
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
I'll kill you first

481
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
I'll kill you first

482
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
I'll kill you first

483
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
I'll kill you first

484
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
I'll kill you first

485
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
I'll kill you first

486
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
I'll kill you first

487
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
I'll kill you first

488
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
I'll kill you first

489
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm going inside

490
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
I'm going inside

491
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Get here

492
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
I'll just hurt you

493
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Nothing

494
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
You treat him like this

495
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
What did you do?

496
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,280
The device is all set after the surge.

497
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,940
All of the objects will beρο

498
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,840
where he was hurt in that barrociotesce εδώ dance Yeti

499
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,540
Isn't this where he sizes up his dare?

500
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,900
Yes.

501
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,940
I want to start the chase study again.

502
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:51,400
Will you take the

503
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,760
the location of the victim.

504
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,400
What are you doing?

505
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,400
It seems that the range of movement

506
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
is quite narrow.

507
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,600
Can you calculate the range of movement

508
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,520
of the left and right lenses?

509
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,200
About 1.5 meters.

510
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,480
The highest is 1.8 meters.

511
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,960
The floor is hollow.

512
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
It's 1 meter wide.

513
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,120
Is it possible that

514
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,160
the place where the victim is locked

515
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,240
is the car of the victim.

516
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,320
The body is likely to be

517
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,960
at the car of the victim

518
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,680
in the alley next to the white sofa.

519
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Search all the main entrance and the main entrance.

520
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,000
Keep an eye on all the cars

521
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
and other things.

522
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,520
Yes.

523
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,560
Go.

524
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,360
Boss,

525
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,880
according to the clues provided by the compensation,

526
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,440
we've locked Hengda Group.

527
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,920
Half an hour after the video was stolen today,

528
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,280
the fund they raised

529
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,600
suddenly began to put a lot of money

530
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,840
in the market.

531
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
They continue to rob and rob.

532
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,360
So, should we

533
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,720
take the person in charge back to the bureau

534
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,440
or check their email first?

535
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,080
Huai Xing,

536
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:58,960
you...

537
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,400
What are you doing?

538
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,800
You're too impulsive.

539
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Boss, look.

540
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,320
A man from kitchen

541
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,840
is coming.

542
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,160
Chui Hao.

543
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
I will sue you for defaming my reputation!

544
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
You are just a scoundrel.

545
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
What right do you have?

546
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,460
You...

547
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,920
I don't care what others say.

548
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I don't care what the world will say.

549
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
I don't understand.

550
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
I don't want to understand.

551
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
I only know

552
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
that I only have my brother's family left.

553
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
It's not good to say it.

554
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
There are some things

555
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
that the old man will never understand.

556
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
I don't want to hear it.

557
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
There are some things

558
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,920
that the old man will do by himself.

559
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
He will definitely be dug out one day.

560
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
He can only keep the fire.

561
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Do you really think

562
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
you can just let it go?

563
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
What are you looking at?

564
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Can you find my brother within ten minutes?

565
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Then keep looking!

566
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Why are you staring at me?

567
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
I am the one who was born by Zhou Junhao!

568
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I am the heir!

569
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
As long as my brother is fine,

570
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
let me tell him

571
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
that my father is a king, he will be fine!

572
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
A man can go to the mountains,

573
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
I will be the king!

574
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
This family is indeed yours,

575
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
but not the group.

576
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Yes.

577
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Such a big listed company

578
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,920
involves many partners and small shareholders.

579
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
When your father was alive,

580
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
he didn't stop the special operation.

581
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Not to mention you,

582
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
you bastard!

583
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Mr. Zhong, Mr. Zheng, you are finally here.

584
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
We are not lucky enough to have you in our family.

585
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
We have caused you trouble.

586
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
We have been entrusted by Zhou's family,

587
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
and we have done our best to investigate the truth

588
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
and to help the Nashi people.

589
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
It is our responsibility.

590
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
This is our job.

591
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
There is nothing troublesome.

592
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Our first goal is to save the hostage.

593
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Based on this,

594
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,920
we will try to reduce the influence of this matter on the outside world.

595
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
If necessary,

596
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
we need the family's cooperation.

597
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Understood.

598
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Especially Mr. Zhou,

599
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
we understand the feelings of the family.

600
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
If there is really no way,

601
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
for the safety of the hostage,

602
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
we can also report to the kidnappers.

603
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
But I hope that this is the last step.

604
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
And we need to discuss it with us in advance.

605
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
So that we can cooperate.

606
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
And Mr. Wu.

607
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Mr. Wu said that Mr. Zhou was too rash.

608
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,920
Aren't you also very anxious?

609
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,920
You can't even log in on your phone.

610
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,920
I think we should stop talking.

611
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Continue to make the comparison.

612
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Young man.

613
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,920
You are very good at doing things.

614
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Thank you.

615
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I think so too.

616
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
But as a senior detective of SID,

617
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
I don't look forward to serving you next time.

618
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Old man, please.

619
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
The fourth video has been released.

620
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Little brother.

621
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
You are so good.

622
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
You have to work hard.

623
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
You have to be a good person.

624
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Don't be a bad person.

625
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm sorry.

626
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
I have been very good.

627
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
I have to work hard.

628
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm sorry.

629
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm sorry.

630
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,920
I'm sorry.

631
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
I'm sorry.

632
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm sorry.

633
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm sorry.

634
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
I'm sorry.

635
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,960
under my last name,

636
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,520
Treasurer Zhou.

637
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,280
Why did you

638
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,120
deal with scalpers so passionately?

639
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,860
Did you arena these three

640
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,640
scalpers

641
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,280
for embroidery

642
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,280
or bad luck?

643
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,400
I did such是的

644
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,360
in a place

645
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,240
so that

646
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,160
when you're alive,

647
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,540
What a suitable plan

648
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm afraid...

649
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm afraid he is not a combined offensive team

650
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,060
Squadron Lu

651
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,260
It's really a transfer car

652
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,300
We have just guessed is from a transfer car

653
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
ハB? has just guessed

654
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,200
It is very Clinic

655
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,740
That's easy

656
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,040
they had been scared and couldn't breathe.

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,880
Xiao Wu.

658
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,280
arl Represent.

659
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,520
Control the people in this room

660
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,160
including the other staff members of the imprisoned.

661
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,240
Put the bandit among them.

662
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Yes.

663
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,720
what will you do with it?

664
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
I will tell you what to do.

665
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:38,920
How do you know how to

666
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,440
tell me

667
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,660
if you want to

668
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,600
andsgess off.

669
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,560
The plato sponsor

670
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,160
is our poison.

671
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,580
Only 지금 vit Lubant is in hot water,

672
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,400
so please focus on relief.

673
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
That way.

674
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Hurry!

675
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Move aside!

676
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
What are you doing?

677
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
Don't move!

678
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Don't move!

679
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
None of them can be involved.

680
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Search!

681
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Yes!

682
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Captain Luo, look.

683
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
This is from the driver who came from the street.

684
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Hello, Jia.

685
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Hello, Boss.

686
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Hengda is in charge of controlling the situation.

687
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
What should we do now?

688
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Tell Hengda that we need to communicate with Baowei directly.

689
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
Answer his question.

690
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Yes!

691
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
It seems that they found Hengda.

692
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Wait.

693
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Come back.

694
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,160
I'll tell you what you want to know.

695
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,160
The spy in the special investigation team is a secret spy.

696
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I haven't seen such a brave suspect for years.

697
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Friend, you're so bold.

698
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
I didn't do anything.

699
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I just made a move.

700
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,160
I know the person who ordered you is in this house.

701
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Maybe he's still watching.

702
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Think about it, sir.

703
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
If Zhou Huaijin is the spy,

704
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,160
you'll be in a different mood if something happens to him.

705
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
I'll ask you one last time.

706
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Who are you doing this for?

707
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,160
If you keep hiding, you're one of the main criminals.

708
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
I...

709
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
I checked the personal accounts, property,

710
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
the police station, and children.

711
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Check them all.

712
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
I don't believe it.

713
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
I don't believe it.

714
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Don't.

715
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Mr. Yang.

716
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
It's Mr. Yang.

717
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Don't look for the kid.

718
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I don't know anything.

719
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Mr. Yang ordered me to do it.

720
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Yang Po?

721
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
What did he ask you to do?

722
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,160
He asked me to register a signal

723
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
and start it in the forum.

724
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I always know your movements.

725
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
So you know where the spy is?

726
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
I really don't know.

727
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
I'm actually Mr. Wu's subordinate.

728
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
I'm not Mr. Yang's man.

729
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
He doesn't completely believe me.

730
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
I just say whatever I hear.

731
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Right?

732
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
They judge for themselves.

733
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
I just know they're still in White Sand River.

734
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
They're afraid of being investigated at high speed.

735
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Mr. Zhou is missing.

736
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
The special investigation team is nervous.

737
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
It's more dangerous.

738
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
It's better to wait until it gets dark.

739
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Anyway, you can give them a signal.

740
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
They also said

741
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
they'd find a convenient place

742
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,160
to drive people into the river.

743
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,160
The kidnappers are running from the window to the shore.

744
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
They can't find the dog after they cross the river.

745
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
I don't know anything.

746
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Hello, Tao Zi.

747
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
We can confirm now

748
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
that the kidnappers are still in the White Sand River.

749
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160
In 10 kilometers,

750
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
they're sent out to the diving area.

751
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
They're sent out to the living area.

752
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
They're sent out to the relatively flat terrain area.

753
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Then there's only Song Shan and Qiao Mu Lin left.

754
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Turn it over.

755
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
We're delaying the kidnappers.

756
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
We don't have much time.

757
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Captain Luo, the kidnappers have lost signal.

758
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
My father is not a good man.

759
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Why did you hurt my brother?

760
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
How can you talk to Zheng?

761
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Do you want my brother to die

762
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
so that you can take over Zhou's family?

763
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
You...

764
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
What are you doing?

765
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Captain Luo, Zheng Kaifeng told the kidnappers just now

766
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
that Zhou's family's public welfare fund has no private problem.

767
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Even if it does, it's a special investigation team's problem.

768
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
It's not something you can explain to me.

769
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
He just finished talking.

770
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
The kidnappers directly cut off the signal.

771
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
What?

772
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
How did you explain it?

773
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
He explained it before.

774
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
And he also agreed to stabilize the kidnappers' time.

775
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
He said it well at first.

776
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Who knew that he would...

777
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Captain Luo, there's a video again.

778
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Don't come over.

779
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Zheng Kaifeng, this old man,

780
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
didn't tell the truth.

781
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
The only one who can save you now

782
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
is yourself.

783
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Tell me.

784
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
I...

785
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
I don't know.

786
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
I don't know the business in my heart.

787
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,160
It's all my father and Zheng's business.

788
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
I don't understand such a complicated story.

789
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Please don't kill me.

790
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Please.

791
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Stop it.

792
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Tell me.

793
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
I'll tell you.

794
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,160
I'll tell you.

795
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
I'll tell you.

796
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
I'll tell you.

797
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
I'll tell you.

798
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
I'll tell you.

799
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Three...

800
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Three public welfare funds.

801
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Only one is for normal people.

802
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
It's for the blind.

803
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
The rest...

804
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,160
are for the blind.

805
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
The funds of the past government

806
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
are full of loopholes.

807
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
It's not easy to be investigated.

808
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
It's a complete disaster.

809
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Do it.

810
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Kill him.

811
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Kill him.

812
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,120
The

813
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
It's there.

814
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
In the water.

815
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Save him.

816
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Save him.

817
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
Go.

818
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Hurry.

819
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Save him.

820
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Go.

821
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Hello, Tao Zi.

822
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Captain Luo.

823
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
I found him.

824
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
How is it?

825
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Is he okay?

826
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
One more thing.

827
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
He's back.

828
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
He'll be fine.

829
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Go.

830
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Sir.

831
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,160
How is he?

832
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
He's fine.

833
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
He just fainted.

834
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
He's not in a closed space.

835
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
There are still women and children under him.

836
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
But his injury...

837
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
might be too late.

838
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Thank you.

839
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
The

840
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
He's not in a closed space.

841
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
There are still women and children under him.

842
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
The

843
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,160
The

844
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,160
The

845
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
The

846
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
The

847
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
The
