1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Guo fei Lin

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

13
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Lo de

14
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Que su?

15
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You

16
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Come out

17
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You

18
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You

19
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go

20
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Go to the temple

21
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Where is the skeleton of Sulina?

22
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Xu dongyu helped him

23
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think we should find the evidence

24
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It should be there

25
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We

26
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I said, Mr. Pei

27
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You are going to be the manager

28
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Throw your money to others

29
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is not your concern

30
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just have a reliable team

31
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or you don't have to be too reliable

32
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just reliable

33
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And now the company's major decision

34
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I still need to sign

35
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
My control is still there

36
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And if one day the company is broken

37
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And what if one day the company falls apart

38
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:21,340
The broken iron left under the

39
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You are not for money

40
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are investigating him

41
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
According to this conclusion

42
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are going to the special investigation team

43
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
For the same purpose

44
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
For what?

45
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How do you know

46
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have been studying hard for years

47
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Lo de

48
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You have seen my grade list

49
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't care what your purpose is

50
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Anyway

51
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You are under my control now

52
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Be careful

53
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Go

54
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Go

55
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is surveillance everywhere

56
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
24 hours of people are watching

57
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Safe

58
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But not like the bank

59
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They are all under their own control

60
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Once controlled by the special investigation team

61
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If it were me

62
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I would think the stock exchange is a good place

63
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The management of this Fukuyama Hall is very strict

64
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But the garden is different

65
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now there are some gardens

66
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The management is too loose

67
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Anyone can enter

68
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is Miss Su Linai's belongings

69
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Her fiancee and daughter put them here

70
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What do you want to see?

71
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's hard to break the law

72
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
in this place

73
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sorry

74
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's not convenient to tell you the details

75
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay

76
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Go

77
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This photo is interesting

78
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But it's too interesting

79
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is exactly the same as the photo

80
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
in our group's archive room 16 years ago

81
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
As a memorial to the dead

82
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's actually a living body

83
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The photos in the white room usually represent

84
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the image of the dead in the hearts of the living friends

85
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If it's someone who is in contact with each other

86
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Sometimes they will choose this move

87
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If it's far apart

88
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's hard to see

89
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If it's someone who is far apart

90
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's hard to see them once

91
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They will choose the most memorial photo

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that represents the life of the dead

93
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is it possible that the most valuable moment

94
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
in Su Linai's life

95
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
is when she was young?

96
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then?

97
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
In someone's eyes

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is she dead?

99
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It seems that there is no use

100
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
for this judgment

101
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This judgment is wrong

102
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It should be reversed

103
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Is the elite of the special forces

104
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
so easy to give up?

105
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can't we check the last place

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and then make a conclusion?

107
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you mean?

108
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let me return the ashes

109
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let me return the ashes

110
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Inside?

111
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is it so perverted?

112
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Perverted?

113
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think your idea of

114
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Changtan is very interesting

115
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
On the one hand, it's a symbol of the mortal

116
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
On the other hand, it gives him extraordinary meaning

117
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The holy, the holy

118
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The one who can't be touched

119
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The one who can't be touched

120
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The one who will never care about what kind of person he is

121
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The sense of ritual and the chance

122
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
are because of the life of the dead

123
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let me tell you

124
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If I open this ashes box

125
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's nothing inside

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll put you in

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's go

128
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's go

129
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It seems I don't have to go in today

130
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's go

131
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He took a fat guy home again today

132
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Disgusting

133
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Su Fei, this bitch

134
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
doesn't deserve to be a mother

135
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Xi Zi came

136
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He helped the drunkard drag him into the house

137
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's done

138
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Su Fei is using me

139
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But the patrol team came to the school today to find Xi Zi

140
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They didn't know he was in the toilet

141
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He didn't want to let him out

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He wanted to deal with it directly

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This matter

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Not only involves Su Lingnai

145
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The source should be Su Lingnai's mother

146
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Su Fei

147
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Who is Xi Zi?

148
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It seems that she was killed earlier than Guo Fei Ling

149
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know

150
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
At this time

151
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We didn't find the victim

152
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If it's the first victim

153
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
She must have been an accident

154
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The characteristics that are not likely to be

155
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
after the death

156
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This Xi Zi was killed

157
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It seems to be a temporary suspicion

158
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But it was also because of this accident

159
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That Su Lingnai's mother Su Fei

160
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
found more useful to Su Lingnai

161
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It seems that they deal with these girls

162
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There should be two rules

163
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Good deal

164
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The exit is a good deal

165
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's not easy to deal with

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is a very complete industrial chain

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's just a Su Fei's mother who is a drunk

168
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It should be possible

169
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
How about Su Ruowan?

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Su Ruowan

171
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you mean?

172
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Will she be sentenced?

173
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why are you asking this?

174
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Just ask

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Learn

176
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I just suddenly feel

177
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The Su family

178
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The common genes that have been passed down for generations

179
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's like the flesh growing on the bones

180
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Can't be torn off

181
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And their growth environment is so extreme

182
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Su Ruowan is probably destined to become

183
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
A person like Su Fei's mother

184
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's also very sad

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't think so

186
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The foundation has never been

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The source of the evil

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The family environment

189
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's impossible to completely decide one's good and evil

190
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What kind of person can you become in the end?

191
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Only you can decide

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I have a question for you

193
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In the diary of the Su family

194
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There is no Su Fei's way to deal with the body

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What do you think?

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If it were me

197
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I would choose to be a teacher

198
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because I have a car

199
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And in that era, there was no way to check DNA

200
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Xinzhou still has a lot of

201
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Undeveloped wild mountains

202
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's all natural market

203
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Even if you're unlucky

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The body is a piece of people who are accidentally identified

205
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There is no way to confirm the identity of the deceased

206
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If it were a teacher

207
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In the diary of the Su family

208
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Should be mentioned

209
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
In addition, a woman addicted to alcohol

210
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And a little girl

211
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There may not be the ability to teach

212
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The body is hard to be found

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Even if it is found

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It won't be an accident

215
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For example, the night grave

216
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Or the shallow water valley full of water grass

217
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If it could be that kind of person

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It would be better to enter the development area

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What are you thinking about?

220
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Just a wound

221
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why do you know how to read?

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Then I won't read

223
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The teacher is a bitch

224
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She said she would take back

225
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
She wants us to buy our own Sui Hua dress as an act

226
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If we don't, we can't participate

227
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Why don't these people die?

228
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is the first time she mentioned Sui Hua dress

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's also the beginning of her partial personality

230
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't have a dress for the rehearsal tomorrow

231
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I met that disgusting fat man outside the school

232
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Surrounding the school

233
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I went with him

234
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He bought me that dress

235
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So that's it

236
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Twenty years ago

237
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:28,340
The first year of our statistical

238
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't want to see him anymore

239
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
These people look down on me

240
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They hurt me

241
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Only he is my knight

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
He said he wanted to adopt me

243
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He wanted me to get rid of the bitch

244
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The bitch said she had been here for half a year

245
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She could trust me and wanted to adopt her

246
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
She wanted it

247
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I hate her

248
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why did she go to see others?

249
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So that sheep

250
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is Guo Feiling

251
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Wu Guangchuan became his knight

252
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But after he found out

253
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wu Guangchuan is no different from other guests

254
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When there is no difference

255
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He started to destroy himself

256
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is the source of all this bias

257
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is

259
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wu Guangchuan and Su Linglai who were stolen 16 years ago

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Maybe we didn't tell you

261
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Xu Dongyu

262
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Is a free photographer

263
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't know

264
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You mean Xu Dongyu was always in Kun's room

265
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes

266
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Only this is a close look

267
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So our initial conclusion is

268
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
In this room, through the wall

269
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There is only one picture of Su Linglai

270
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The person who was stolen was the window of Wu Guangchuan's room

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So we infer

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Xu Dongyu must have that house

273
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Which can be seen in the direction of Wu Guangchuan's room

274
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And this house is also the real crime scene

275
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Of all the cases

276
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But we don't have any evidence to prove

277
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
These pictures were taken by Xu Dongyu

278
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But if we can find this place

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Xu Dongyu's iron will not run away

280
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But we have already checked

281
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
All of Xu Dongyu's credit cards, real estate, and other items

282
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
There is no such place

283
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Where should we start to investigate

284
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So I asked you to ask Guosheng

285
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
How did Xu Dongyu take her to Wu Guangchuan

286
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What's wrong

287
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What are you studying

288
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Reading

289
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But I can't remember

290
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not something I know in practice

291
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Usually when I receive the other person's name card

292
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I will pay attention to the other person's facial features

293
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's not like we are playing together

294
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's what people who play together are like

295
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Even if they are alone, they will not be like this

296
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Old man with a good sense of duty

297
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Actually, I am not very sensitive to facial sensitivity

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't remember much after a month

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So I have the impression

300
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It should be in 30 days

301
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Qin Shi

302
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Who

303
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The day of the kidnapping

304
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In the club of the West Lake

305
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This person has been beating in the corner

306
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
After that, when we went to find Xu Dong

307
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
He was also there

308
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I just heard from an investigator

309
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It seems that there is still a little girl who has not been found

310
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes, it should be her

311
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That day, she was the one who took the initiative

312
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
To help find Xu Dong

313
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No wonder

314
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That day, we were in the same place

315
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
No, we did not find anything

316
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That day we checked all the passports

317
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Because we never doubted

318
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Help our club members

319
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Do you have any other photos of her

320
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes, members of the West Lake club

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All have photos

322
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
With this person's name

323
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Others can follow

324
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
A big deal

325
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Lan Dangya

326
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Your favorite job is here

327
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Catch people

328
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Drink water

329
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Thank you

330
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Uncle Guo

331
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I am looking for you

332
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Today I want to ask you

333
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
To help me remember one thing

334
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That day

335
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It was the day of the kidnapping

336
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
How did you find the five square

337
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There is a boy

338
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes, this person is Xu Dongyu

339
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
He was with you investigating the five square

340
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Do you remember what he said

341
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
When he contacted you

342
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
At that time

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He left me a message

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It seems

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It seems that

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He took her away

347
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
From school

348
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yes, that's it

349
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's very hidden

350
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No name

351
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I heard it

352
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The whole person's scalp was blown up

353
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I quickly found a public phone

354
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I called him

355
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Tell me the details

356
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Then

357
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I asked the situation

358
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I went to the school to find him

359
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That boy

360
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Walks in the direction of the five square

361
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The five square took Su Lingnan from school

362
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Back to his house

363
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You also started from near the school

364
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How did you dare to be in front of the five square

365
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
To his house

366
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That boy took me to the entrance

367
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It should have gone from the back

368
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It has to go around a large area

369
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We both went through that area

370
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That community

371
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
There is no net

372
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Only a circle of outer walls

373
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There is a butterfly on the wall

374
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Empty wall

375
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I am behind the wall

376
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Just saw the girl

377
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Who pulled the five square

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I saw the girl

379
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I was young

380
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I was going to take the child away

381
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I just followed

382
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The five square

383
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Do you remember the location of the community

384
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Remember, but now it's a school

385
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Uncle Guo, can you

386
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Put the few places you mentioned

387
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
In the picture

388
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Why are you asking this

389
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What happened

390
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Did Luo call you just now

391
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Uncle Guo

392
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We are still investigating this case

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We can't reveal so much for now

394
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Officer

395
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I just want to ask

396
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I just

397
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Saw so many people coming

398
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm a little worried

399
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I just want to ask

400
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I just saw so many people coming

401
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm a little worried

402
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I was killing five square

403
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Did I kill the wrong person

404
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Uncle Guo

405
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't worry

406
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I will definitely give you an explanation

407
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I will definitely give you an explanation

408
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This is the map of the plan

409
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Wu Guangcheng lived in this community

410
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He was very careful about the selection of the middle school students

411
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This is probably the one

412
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Follow the map and change the location

413
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes

414
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm sorry

415
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Thank you

416
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This is the school district

417
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This is the school district

418
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The other people follow me

419
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yes

420
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Go

421
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Go

422
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Go

423
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Go

424
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Go

425
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Go

426
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I know

427
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You are Su Lingnai's fiance

428
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But I just want to know

429
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You want to marry Su Lingnai

430
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Is it because you have no feelings for him

431
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Or

432
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You like his beautiful daughter

433
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is the officer, you are responsible

434
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Su Lingnai is a widow

435
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
No education, no background

436
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No job

437
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Likes to make a living

438
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What a bad word

439
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You have a good career

440
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You have a car and a house

441
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You have a good looking

442
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I always feel strange

443
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
If what you said is true

444
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Why is he unwilling to marry you

445
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Wen Ning and Ai Quan

446
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Can't be measured by material standards

447
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Moreover

448
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
This is the death of me and him

449
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He doesn't want to marry you

450
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Is it because he is willing to give up money

451
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Or are you also unwilling to marry him

452
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What does this have to do with the case

453
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You can question everything about the case

454
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It doesn't matter, even if I am innocent

455
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But you can't have a wife

456
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If you stick to Xiangying community

457
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Building 8, 501

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The bedroom in the south of the court is stuck on the window

459
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Love

460
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What are you talking about

461
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Didn't hear what

462
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Then I'll make it clear

463
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Xiangying community

464
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Building 8

465
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The photography you took this year

466
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Still stuck on the window

467
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Bloodstains on the scene

468
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Means that DNA can still track

469
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The car in the house is not parked

470
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In the SUV has your hair

471
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
And

472
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
The back of the picture

473
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There is a photo taken

474
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Just handed over to me

475
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000

480
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The property

481
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The building

482
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Was

483
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Open

484
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000

You offered to alley via where I expert about what's something about sex.

490
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,360
So, which external immigrations were next?

491
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,460
Confirmed, in my city.

492
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,180
Our train, station, company.

493
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,800
What do you do there?

494
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,280
Information review in progress.

495
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,820

You're a good person.

512
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,140
I did it for Su Linan.

513
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Su Linan is the best student in our class.

514
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Ever since she entered the first year of school, I've liked her.

515
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
She has a kind of...

516
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
...soul.

517
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,140
She has a special feeling in her body that no one else has.

518
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
She's close to me when I'm in the film.

519
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
But she's too stubborn.

520
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
I want to have more free time to get close to her.

521
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
I told my mom...

522
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
...that I wanted to move to a place where Li Xue can get close to her.

523
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Who knew...

524
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,140
...she'd be so stubborn.

525
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Su Linan

526
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
And then?

527
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
How did you know that Su Linan wasn't a simple victim?

528
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,140
I don't know how I got into her life.

529
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
I've been thinking about her all night.

530
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
One time, I couldn't help it.

531
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
I lied to my teacher...

532
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
...and went to see her in the hospital.

533
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
On my way there...

534
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,140
...I saw her with a girl I didn't know.

535
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,140
I hesitated and called her.

536
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
She left quietly.

537
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Not long after...

538
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
...I heard the news that the girl had disappeared.

539
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
I was relieved.

540
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
I had a bad feeling about it.

541
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,140
The next day...

542
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
...I went to her house to do my homework.

543
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,140
Su Linan

544
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
Su Linan

545
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
Help me.

546
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Don't tell anyone.

547
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,140
Help me. Don't tell anyone.

548
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,140
Don't. Don't tell anyone.

549
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,140
I'm the monitor.

550
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,140
I just need to tell my family.

551
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,140
My teacher believes me.

552
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
She can answer any question.

553
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
But for her...

554
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,140
...I lied and didn't commit a crime.

555
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,140
I gave her everything I had in my past ten years.

556
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
She ruined me.

557
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
She ruined me.

558
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
I'm so sorry.

559
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,140
I'm sorry.

560
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
I was too reckless today.

561
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,140
I didn't tell anyone about this for 16 years.

562
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,140
Even my family members don't know about it.

563
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140
Can you tell me...

564
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,140
...how you felt when you helped the police investigate Wu Guangchang?

565
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,140
How did you feel?

566
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,140
I thought Wu Guangchang had taken her.

567
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,140
I promised her I'd keep it a secret.

568
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,140
I didn't tell anyone.

569
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
I was so suspicious.

570
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
I was a little boy.

571
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,140
I was a hero.

572
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
I wanted to...

573
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,140
...save Su Linan.

574
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
I followed Wu Guangchang.

575
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,140
The police saw us.

576
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,140
We were investigating.

577
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
He was investigating too.

578
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
We did it for our loved ones.

579
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,140
I felt sorry for him.

580
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,140
He had a sense of security.

581
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140
I didn't know...

582
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
...he would kill Wu Guangchang.

583
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,140
I knew I wouldn't help him.

584
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,140
I thought the nightmare would end when he died.

585
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,140
But those people didn't know where they got the information about the child.

586
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
Do you know...

587
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,140
...how I felt when I found out about the girl in the ad...

588
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,140
...and was sent to the police station by you?

589
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,140
I was so shocked when I found out about the incident 16 years ago.

590
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,140
Don't pretend. I forgot.

591
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,140
You caught me.

592
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,140
I'm free now.

593
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,140
I don't want to be a scapegoat.

594
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,140
Boss.

595
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Don't be anxious.

596
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,140
I have a few questions.

597
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,140
You said you couldn't control Su Ruowan.

598
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,140
But that girl didn't say that.

599
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
She said you two worked well together.

600
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,140
You pretended to be a busy man...

601
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,140
...and followed Zhang Yuchen.

602
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,140
When the child was acting alone...

603
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
...you suddenly scared him...

604
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,140
...and made Su Ruowan appear.

605
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,140
You tricked the child's heart.

606
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
You tricked the child's trust.

607
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Is that true?

608
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,140
No.

609
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,140
Xu Dongyue.

610
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:45,140
You found out about the relationship between Wu Guangchao and Su Ruowan.

611
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
You thought it was unreasonable.

612
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,140
You suspected Wu Guangchao of rape.

613
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,140
But you didn't tell anyone about it.

614
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,140
You started to make a fool of yourself.

615
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,140
You took pictures.

616
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,140
I'm sorry.

617
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,140
Did you have fun?

618
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,140
No.

619
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,140
Did you still miss her?

620
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,140
You said you didn't go up to say hello...

621
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,140
...to a stranger because she was with a stranger.

622
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Why?

623
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Can a stranger say hello to his own classmate?

624
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Or you didn't go to say hello at all?

625
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,140
Su Ruowan was hit by you.

626
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,140
How did she hit you?

627
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,140
Didn't she hide it before she opened the door?

628
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,140
You broke in.

629
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,140
You broke in when Su Ruowan was not home.

630
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,140
Only a girl was inside.

631
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,140
What did you want to do?

632
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
I didn't.

633
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
I know you didn't.

634
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,140
You didn't do anything to those girls.

635
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
It's because...

636
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
...you can't do it.

637
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,140
I didn't!

638
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,140
You took pictures of her when she was young.

639
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,140
You posted photos of her 16 years ago...

640
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,140
...in the glass window.

641
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,140
Because you were obsessed with that pervert...

642
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,140
...who could have killed his classmate's daughter, Su Linai.

643
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,140
You didn't scare her to death...

644
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,140
...and you were only scared by her pervert mother and your sheep.

645
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,140
I'm asking you.

646
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Did you see her commit the same crime as you did back then...

647
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,140
...to make you feel excited?

648
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Why did you want to marry Su Ruowan?

649
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Because you saw Su Ruowan 16 years later...

650
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,140
...becoming the way she was back then.

651
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
Do you want to be the same as me?

652
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,140
Tell me!

653
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,140
Where are the victims of the murder?

654
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,140
I'll never forget...

655
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,140
...the day I met her.

656
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,140
You're not Su Ruowan.

657
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,140
Of course you're not.

658
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,140
You're a good assistant.

659
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,140
You can eat meat.

660
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,140
You...

661
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,140
No!

662
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,140
No!

663
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,140
Xu Dong has confessed.

664
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
The body is in the 13th district of Binghai Bay.

665
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
Let's go.

666
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,140
Run!

667
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,140
