00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 16

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,520
The summer 16 years ago,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,400
Lingling met a child

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,960
who claimed to come to Lotus Mountain with her parents.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,240
She was dressed like a lotus.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
She was very pretty.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,760
But she seemed to be unable to distinguish between the north and the south.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,880
How many times did she ask Lingling?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,040
One day, after class,

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Lingling met this girl again.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,640
The girl was very anxious.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
She claimed that her father was hospitalized.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,160
She couldn't find the way back to the hotel.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,760
Lingling was a warm-hearted child.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,440
So she decided to bring that girl back to her destination.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
That girl

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,320
was Su Linan.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,800
She lied to Lingling

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,640
and gave her the drink that she had added.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,480
She left her in the hotel

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
and waited for the five-star hotel.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,720
Su Linan.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,240
Tell me.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Tell me the truth.

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,480
This was Su Linan's own action.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,560
Wu Guangcheng and Wen You prepared it.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,320
Did they kill Nian Kao on purpose

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,240
or did they kill Lingling by accident?

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,240
We can't know now.

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,480
Later, they put her in the trunk

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
and left Lotus Mountain.

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,560
Su Linan took the pencil case of Lingling.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
Su Linan's connection with the murderer

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,080
made her very jealous of the victim.

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,760
On the way,

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,480
they had a fight.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,240
Su Linan ran down the street with a car.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,040
She found a public phone near the garbage dump.

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,560
She suddenly thought of a way to find it.

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,520
She called you with a phone

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,320
and told you to hear the sound of pencil and shaking.

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Why did she...

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,840
Why?

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
Because she was jealous of a rich family like yours

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
and a happy family.

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,600
She grew up to be a girl

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,080
who is ten thousand times better than her.

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,680
She has something that she couldn't get in 20 years.

49
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,640
Uncle Guo.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,040
You're not wrong.

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,120
You're just too kind.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Where is Lingling?

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
Where is she now?

54
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,120
Can I take her home?

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,160
It's just a game.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,160
Let it go.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,720
I need him to serve you for me.

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,680
Got it.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,280
This is Big Brother.

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,200
I won't let her get hurt.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,280
My son is your son.

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
He's so young.

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,040
Young?

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,160
Young.

65
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,040
I won't let him hurt anyone anymore.

66
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
Don't let him hurt anyone.

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Okay.

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,160
Don't hurt him.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,560
You two.

70
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,440
Let's go.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
Su Mo has been found dead.

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
According to the special investigation team,

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,200
the suspect, Su Mo,

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,120
is not the one who was said to be the victim.

75
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,040
So whether the genes are the decisive factor of the crime,

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,120
we still have room to discuss.

77
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,040
Show me your phone.

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Hello, Du Jia?

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,480
I get the uses of the 13 인�ofere holdings now.

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,760
What is it?

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,200
I will지는 be a homosexual in a few minutes.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
When I looked back in my youth,

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,120
most of those days

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,760
many transactions

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,640
repeatedly had happened.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
The people who were in the battle

87
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
all flew away from me.

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
You just heard

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
the award of the 7th place in the music reading

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
for the best score.

91
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
The winner is...

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
The winner is...

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Thank you for your...

94
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Teacher,

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
The Su family's line

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
is over.

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
They are not important.

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
Yes.

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
But,

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
can we

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
start to contact Pei Su?

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
He is indeed

103
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
a very interesting person.

104
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
If it wasn't for his blood

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
flowing in his genes,

106
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
he would probably become

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
the student I am most proud of.

108
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Teacher,

109
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,640
I will send you back to rest.

110
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Okay.

111
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Luo Bin,

112
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
we will see

113
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
which book we choose next.

114
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Pei Su,

115
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
come to mommy.

116
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Isn't it just a grave?

117
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
They can still

118
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
make flowers.

119
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Pei Su,

120
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
what did you hear?

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Pei Su,

122
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
are you going to kill me?

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Pei Su,

124
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
are you going to kill a pet?

125
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Pei Su,

126
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
save me!

127
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Pei Su!

128
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I am sorry.

129
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I am sorry.

130
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I am sorry.

131
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
I am sorry.

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I am sorry.

133
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I am sorry.

134
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I am sorry.

135
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I am sorry.

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
I am sorry.

137
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
I am sorry.

138
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I am sorry.

139
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I am sorry.

140
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I am sorry.

141
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
I am sorry.

142
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
I am sorry.

143
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I am sorry.

144
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I am sorry.

145
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I am sorry.

146
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I am sorry.

147
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
I am sorry.

148
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
I am sorry.

149
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I am sorry.

150
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I am sorry.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I am sorry.

152
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
I am sorry.

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I am sorry.

154
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I am sorry.

155
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
I am sorry.

156
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
What's wrong with you?

157
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
You look so ugly.

158
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
I had a dream.

159
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Come on.

160
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Where are we going?

161
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
You'll know when you're here.

162
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
This is Pei Cheng Yu's secret base.

163
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Take a look.

164
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
It's all the garbage from the battlefield.

165
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Hello?

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Hello?

167
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
You look so ordinary.

168
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I do.

169
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
But I just remembered that

170
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I saw the investment agreement

171
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
about the 13th District before.

172
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
I always want to find something

173
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
in my memory.

174
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
But something always stops me.

175
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
What's this?

176
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
The main investment is

177
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
the Guangyao Fund

178
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
I told you about.

179
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
So, the one who asked Pei Shi

180
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
to invest in the development project

181
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,640
of the 13th District's ice coast

182
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
is the Guangyao Fund.

183
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Before Pei Cheng Yu was hospitalized,

184
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
he invested in the project

185
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
through the Guangyao Fund every year.

186
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
That is, he supported the Guangyao Fund

187
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
regularly.

188
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
But the plan for the 13th District

189
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
was put off.

190
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
The reason is that

191
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,640
the capital is bigger

192
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
and there is no mature oil and oil model.

193
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
It sounds like a drag.

194
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
But no matter what the reason is,

195
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
after the 13th District,

196
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Pei Shi stopped supporting

197
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
the Guangyao Fund.

198
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Then,

199
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
something happened to your father.

200
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
So, our judgment was right.

201
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Pei Cheng Yu has been

202
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
supporting the Guangyao Fund

203
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
on the surface.

204
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
But it must be an organization

205
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
in the dark.

206
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I don't know why.

207
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
The project of the 13th District's ice coast

208
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
became the turning point

209
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
of their relationship.

210
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
By the way,

211
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
you said on the phone just now

212
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
that you knew the role

213
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
of the 13th District.

214
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
What is it?

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
The throwing of the body.

216
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
There are three principles of throwing the body.

217
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
One,

218
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
throwing the body

219
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
must be absolutely perfect and safe.

220
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
No one will be able to

221
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
turn the earth upside down

222
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
without any control.

223
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
No one will find

224
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
the secret hidden under it.

225
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Two,

226
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
the body can be perfectly

227
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
mixed into the normal

228
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
dead body.

229
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Even if someone finds it,

230
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
it won't be reported.

231
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Three,

232
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
even if it is reported,

233
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
it can't prove the identity

234
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
of the deceased.

235
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
The ice coast is such a perfect

236
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
throwing of the body.

237
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
If it wasn't for the safety

238
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
of the Su family,

239
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
it might be a life-threatening

240
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
case for the Su family.

241
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
It might not be

242
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
a public business for a lifetime.

243
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
So,

244
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
this case,

245
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
we have been guessing

246
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
the relationship between the cleaners

247
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
and this organization.

248
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Now it seems very clear

249
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
that they are the enemy.

250
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
But Mr. Pei,

251
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
in this way,

252
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
we have one more opponent.

253
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Maybe.

254
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Have you ever heard of

255
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,640
the enemy's position

256
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
as a friend?

257
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Master,

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I brought you

259
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
your favorite wine.

260
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
We haven't drunk it

261
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
since winter.

262
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Let's have another one today.

263
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Come on.

264
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Come on.

265
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Come on.

266
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Come on.

267
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Come on.

268
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Come on.

269
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Come on.

270
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Come on.

271
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Come on.

272
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I'll keep

273
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
the rest for you.

274
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Master,

275
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
actually,

276
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I want to tell you something.

277
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Guo Wei Ling's case was broken.

278
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
The murderer was caught.

279
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
You just went to the branch.

280
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I know.

281
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
It's useless to tell you.

282
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
In our field,

283
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
even the most free-minded people

284
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
are always in a state of panic

285
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
as long as the case is not broken.

286
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
The faces of the victims

287
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
are always in your eyes.

288
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
By the way,

289
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
did Tao Zi tell you

290
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
that the murderer

291
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
was caught?

292
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Tao Zi told you

293
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
that the murderer was caught?

294
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Although we don't know

295
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
what you want to tell us,

296
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
we found that

297
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
the two major cases

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
that we received from the special investigation team

299
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
are all involved.

300
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
So please rest assured.

301
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
We will find out the truth.

302
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Master,

303
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I've been very anxious recently.

304
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
These two cases

305
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
look like a robbery case.

306
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
But they are not completely solved.

307
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
After our investigation,

308
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
we can almost be sure that

309
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
it may be the backer

310
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
who is committing the crime of not knowing.

311
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
And these two cases

312
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
are all involved with the cleaners.

313
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
And also involved with

314
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Pei Su.

315
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
I told you about Pei Su.

316
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
He is the family of the victim

317
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
of my first case.

318
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
He said that he had

319
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
an abnormal memory.

320
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
But it's strange.

321
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
In my heart,

322
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
he is neither like a robber

323
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
nor an ordinary person.

324
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Especially his reaction

325
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
to these two cases.

326
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Zhou Hongchuan

327
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
is very good at hiding himself.

328
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
How did you see it?

329
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
When the girl was lost,

330
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:30,200
she was wearing this

331
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,400
and contained the traces of the crimeSMiled.

332
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,660
Unfortunately,

333
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:48,660
he had lost contact with these cases.

334
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,800
Senior!

335
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Junior sister!

336
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Uncle, it's my father's death anniversary tomorrow.

337
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,640
You come here one day in advance every year.

338
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,560
You must be afraid to meet my mother.

339
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,960
How is Shiniang recently?

340
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,680
Same as before.

341
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,320
Uncle Zhang and Uncle Du will visit me at home sometimes.

342
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
You know how my mother is.

343
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,640
We didn't take care of Yang.

344
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
Shiniang should love her.

345
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,160
By the way, why did you come here one day in advance?

346
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
I have another arrangement tomorrow.

347
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,520
Captain Gu.

348
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,000
Captain Duan.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
So you are so diligent today.

350
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Thank you, Captain Gu.

351
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,760
I brought five bowls.

352
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
Come on.

353
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,280
What are you doing?

354
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Don't wait.

355
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,440
Let's go.

356
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
Listen to me.

357
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,680
I asked Pei Su.

358
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,760
She comes here once or twice in a week.

359
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
Not every day.

360
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,040
After the survey project is over,

361
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,320
she will leave immediately.

362
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,360
She will never stay long.

363
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,840
She just stays here temporarily for a few days.

364
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
It's called stay temporarily for a few days.

365
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,880
Well.

366
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
I saw it.

367
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,840
It's good.

368
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
Well.

369
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,120
There are two tables outside.

370
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,200
Two tables?

371
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
Pei Su is alone.

372
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,200
No.

373
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,440
Xinzhou government gave us two designers.

374
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
What?

375
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
You don't know them?

376
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Sorry, brother.

377
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,040
I didn't tell you yesterday.

378
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,120
Don't mind it.

379
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,880
Brother.

380
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,120
I didn't tell you yesterday.

381
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Don't mind it.

382
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
Anyway.

383
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,600
Can you press us into work on Sponsor?

384
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,040
Mr Zhang.

385
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,360
Look at it.

386
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,480
It's Pan Yun Heng.

387
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,880
These two teachers.

388
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,120
They have been research the criminal psychology.

389
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,240
They propose a sub-project survey

390
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,460
which selects files Search cases

391
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,640
from criminal psychology

392
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,600
and trace contoges of Miniaberians.

393
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
is actually quite clear.

394
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Right, Pei Su?

395
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Yes, Chief.

396
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
After all, I graduated from Xinzhou Law School.

397
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm considered your senior.

398
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
If you have any requests, please mention it.

399
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I will ask Captain Luo to cooperate with you.

400
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Captain Luo, you don't have any objections, right?

401
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
No.

402
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
You two just arrived.

404
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
We are...

405
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
I'm here to convey what Team Leader Du just said.

406
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
The joint research project with Xinzhou Law School

407
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
was launched many years ago.

408
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
It was also called the Lingdu Project.

409
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Later, due to some reasons, it was not discussed anymore.

410
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
This year, Professor Pan is the same.

411
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Team Leader Zhang also thinks it's very meaningful.

412
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
The Supervisory Bureau recently approved it.

413
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
They especially approved it.

414
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Xinzhou Law School's research group

415
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
has sent two members to be the team.

416
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
The two of them don't need me to introduce them.

417
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
So, for the sake of research,

418
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
we can proceed smoothly.

419
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
For the sake of the two interns,

420
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
we can get enough training.

421
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
This joint internship

422
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
will also be very strict in management.

423
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
When the research group is in the process,

424
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
all programs must be followed by the team's regulations.

425
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
No signature and seal can be checked.

426
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Any information that has not been announced to the society

427
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,600
can't be taken or taken away.

428
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
This is the rule.

429
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I hope that some interns

430
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
can tell me about your free time.

431
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
This is a special department.

432
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
It's not your company.

433
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
You can come and go as you want.

434
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
During the internship,

435
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
you must come at the normal working time.

436
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
If you want to come back early or late,

437
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
you must have a proper reason or request for leave.

438
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Is there any difficulty?

439
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Usually, the most free-spirited person

440
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
is always pretending to be a big boss.

441
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Besides,

442
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
our professional environment is special.

443
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Those who are behind us are big or small.

444
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
We can meet at any scene.

445
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Blood, flesh, and flesh are all small things.

446
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
What giant face can we meet?

447
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Boss, are you still eating?

448
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
We have to be wise.

449
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
We should eat and drink.

450
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
There are only doctors here.

451
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
If you don't have a preparation team,

452
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
you can easily pass out if you smell blood.

453
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I suggest you think about it before you come.

454
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Thank you for your extra attention.

455
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Captain Luo,

456
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
you said that the Lingdu Project was already there.

457
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Why didn't I hear about it?

458
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
That was nine years ago.

459
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
You haven't been to college yet.

460
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Why did it stop later?

461
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
The conditions are not mature.

462
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Many theories cannot be tested.

463
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
It's not worth it.

464
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Then why?

465
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Why are there so many questions?

466
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Alright, let's eat.

467
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Don't be so happy.

468
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
You're not going to work in the afternoon?

469
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Let's eat.

470
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Alright, let's welcome the two of you.

471
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Welcome to SID.

472
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Let's eat.

473
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Let's eat first.

474
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Let's eat.

475
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
You can look at it openly.

476
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,320
Captain Luo, I'm not taking any fees.

477
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,760
What's this?

478
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,800
In the notebook,

479
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,720
Su Lin didn't mention

480
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,200
the details of the pencil and the bell.

481
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,760
So when we were investigating

482
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
Guo Feilin's case,

483
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,800
Guo Shunan was the one

484
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
who told Xu Dongyu about the details.

485
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,000
Then Xu Dongyu told Su Ruowan about it.

486
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,680
So here's the question.

487
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,800
Why did Guo Shunan

488
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,480
tell Xu Dongyu about the details?

489
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
This detail hasn't been exposed.

490
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,560
So how did Su Ruowan know about it?

491
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,320
Who told him?

492
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,760
Or maybe...

493
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,520
Who led him?

494
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,280
Hello?

495
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,880
Captain,

496
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,160
we just received a personal request.

497
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,440
It's a complicated case.

498
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,360
Look who's still in the team.

499
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,880
Take him with you.

500
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,840
What request?

501
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,520
It sounds complicated.

502
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
On Junhao Road,

503
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,680
a truck collided with a car.

504
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,000
They were killed and injured.

505
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,040
A truck accident?

506
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,480
A truck accident?

507
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,360
Why would they make such a mistake?

508
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,600
I heard it was Zhou Junhao.

509
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,920
Which Zhou Junhao?

510
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,560
Could it be that Zhou Junhao?

511
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,440
Take him there now.

512
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,720
Okay.

513
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:13,960
Let's go.

514
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,440
At 3.37 this afternoon,

515
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,400
the famous charity Zhou Junhao

516
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,160
was on his way back from the airport.

517
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
He was suddenly chased by a truck.

518
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Zhou Junhao and the truck driver were killed.

519
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,520
The driver and the bodyguard were badly injured.

520
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
They're still in the emergency.

521
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,280
Zhou Junhao is 63 years old.

522
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,560
He's the owner of Zhou's Airport and Zhou's Transport.

523
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,840
He's 30 years old and he's the leader of Zhou's Group.

524
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,880
He won the free trade market in the past.

525
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,440
After that,

526
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,920
Zhou's Group has made a contribution

527
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,560
to the development of the transport business in the port.

528
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,760
He's also the leader of Zhou's Group.

529
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,880
He won the Xinzhou Sleep Medal.

530
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,760
Zhou Junhao is a famous businessman and charity.

531
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,600
He's a low-key and simple man.

532
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,920
He has done many charity work

533
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,360
like donating to welfare homes, hospitals, schools,

534
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,920
and the construction of Xinzhou Public Fund.

535
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,740
He has made a contribution to the

536
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,040
It's only been an hour since the accident.

537
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,120
It's already a mess.

538
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,880
Zhou's Group and its shareholder company

539
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,960
have been waiting for a long time.

540
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,720
I hope that the sky won't stand too much.

541
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,080
Mr. Pei,

542
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,720
you know so many rich people.

543
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Show some high-level talent.

544
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,760
Call the doctor.

545
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,720
Sister,

546
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,520
what did you want to ask just now?

547
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,800
Pei...

548
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
Have you seen Zhou Junhao?

549
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,760
I've seen him once,

550
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
but I can't say much.

551
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm familiar with his son,

552
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,080
Zhou Huaixing.

553
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
He's the one who entrusted us with the investigation.

554
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,880
Zhou Junhao has two sons.

555
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,840
The eldest son is Zhou Huaijing.

556
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
He's a young talent.

557
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
He graduated from a prestigious school

558
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,960
and started to help his family manage assets very early.

559
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,440
He often works abroad.

560
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
The fourth son, Zhou Huaixing, is a painter.

561
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Are you talking about him?

562
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,560
Yes.

563
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,800
How do you two know each other?

564
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,680
Because you both like art?

565
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,040
Of course not.

566
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,560
That's because we both

567
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,880
are the best in the business.

568
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,920
If you want to know if there's any truth to this,

569
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
you have to investigate it.

570
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,800
Anyway, I think

571
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,720
it's a traffic accident

572
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,560
caused by a car accident.

573
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,360
Did you see anything else before the accident?

574
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,000
Yes.

575
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,520
This is Zhou Junhao's car.

576
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,320
He drove normally from the airport.

577
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
The driver drove normally.

578
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,200
This is the car of Zhao Shi Dahuo.

579
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,120
Zhao Shi Dahuo came in from Beiming Bridge.

580
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,520
We started to make the number of the surveillance cameras

581
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,440
at the intersection of Beiming Bridge.

582
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,080
At that time, there were not many cars at the airport.

583
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,400
From the fourth surveillance camera,

584
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,360
Dahuo and the front car were driving in the same car lane.

585
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
There were other cars between the two cars.

586
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,840
But the traffic was over.

587
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,160
When we walked to the 16th surveillance camera,

588
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,080
Dahuo and the front car had nothing.

589
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,920
But the car was quite safe.

590
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,400
Then you see,

591
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,240
when Dahuo passed the 18th surveillance camera,

592
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
the distance from the front car

593
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,440
suddenly decreased significantly.

594
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,760
Look again.

595
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,720
We found that he was accelerating very evenly.

596
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,040
It seemed that the driver stepped on the foot on the gas door

597
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,480
and forgot to take it down.

598
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,840
When we passed the 20th surveillance camera,

599
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,480
the speed of the car was almost 140 kilometers per hour.

600
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,960
It was obviously overspeed.

601
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,200
That's the situation.

602
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,120
The driver had no breath before he arrived at the hospital.

603
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
The driving record shows

604
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,040
that he drove this car for ten hours.

605
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,480
He was tired and tired.

606
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,680
If it wasn't for his family,

607
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,280
he would have been asked to be transferred to the special investigation team.

608
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,840
This matter can't be brought to you.

609
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,320
Who is Zhao Shi's driver?

610
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,640
Is there any potential?

611
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,600
Look.

612
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
The driver's name is Dong Xian.

613
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
He is 49 years old.

614
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,040
He is a driver of Dahuo with a driving license.

615
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,200
A person who just passed the test

616
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,520
was one of their team.

617
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,800
He said that Dong Xian is a very honest person.

618
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
He has been driving this road for ten years.

619
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
He has never had an accident.

620
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,560
Besides, look at him.

621
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
It doesn't seem like he can be related to the car factory.

622
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,400
Xiaoyang,

623
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,800
take Liang Xin to investigate.

624
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Yes.

625
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,840
Do you think his family is reliable?

626
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,760
I think

627
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
they want to make a fool of the news.

628
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,680
Ask her.

629
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Jin Shun.

630
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,960
És hair.

631
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Ricochet.

632
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
One copy.

633
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,760
Get in.

634
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
Disipher.

635
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,320
Today is going to be a bright day,

636
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,200
and our lives are going to be bright.

637
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,640
I'll stand for you.

638
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,040
Go, go, go.

639
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,200
Pei Ye.

640
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,840
Why are you here?

641
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,760
Me?

642
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm studying.

643
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,040
I'm at the CSR internship.

644
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,440
CSR?

645
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,400
Why are you at the CSR?

646
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,720
To be a detective.

647
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,920
It's exciting.

648
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,560
Pei Ye,

649
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,520
You…

650
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,520
What's your objection?

651
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
My father has always been in good health.

652
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
He's been working out every day.

653
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
He even went to the marathon in the spring.

654
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
He can't just die like that.

655
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Mr. Zhou, I know you might not be able to accept reality at the moment.

656
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
But Mr. Zhou died in a car accident.

657
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Not to mention the marathon.

658
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Even if it's a three-way, there's no way to prevent a car accident.

659
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Mr. Zhou, you have to listen to me.

660
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
You have to listen to me.

661
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Mr. Zhou,

662
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
this kind of thing can't be considered evidence.

663
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
You don't believe me either?

664
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
My intuition is always the most accurate.

665
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
My father usually goes out.

666
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
He saw that big car with a glass in the room.

667
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
He happened to do this today.

668
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
And then something happened.

669
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Is this a coincidence?

670
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Last week, I just finished my 63rd birthday.

671
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
We agreed to celebrate it.

672
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I'm not going to celebrate it.

673
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
On my 13th birthday, we agreed to retire.

674
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
I want to make a will.

675
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Leave some of the shares to me and my brother.

676
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
This week, I just came back.

677
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
Mr. Zhou only has two sons.

678
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Even if you don't make a will,

679
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
the inheritance will be yours in the future.

680
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Why do you think this is the reason for his death?

681
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Mr. Zhou, I know you're sad.

682
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
But since you've asked for the inheritance,

683
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
can you be serious?

684
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
We're not here to spend time with you.

685
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Can you sit still and talk to me?

686
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
I don't know.

687
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
I don't care about those things.

688
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
You can talk to my brother.

689
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
I've already called him anyway.

690
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
He'll be here tomorrow morning.

691
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
A car is a big weapon.

692
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
A big weapon is more deadly than a knife.

693
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Everyone on the street is legally armed.

694
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
You can't kill people on purpose.

695
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
You can just cover up the accident.

696
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Do you care about this?

697
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
The driver of the Zhao family is dead.

698
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Mr. Zhou,

699
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
are you hinting us

700
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
that someone is willing to sacrifice his life

701
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
to kill your father?

702
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Mr. Zhou,

703
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
do you believe that

704
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
money can be bought with life?

705
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
A-Sou,

706
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
are you really a fool or a bastard?

707
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
You wasted so much time with us.

708
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
You played the childish tricks several times.

709
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
You seem to know something

710
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
but you don't want to tell others.

711
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
You're so stupid.

712
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
You're so stupid but you don't want to tell others.

713
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
He's a simple person.

714
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
He doesn't have many tricks.

715
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
You two seem to know each other.

716
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Do you need money

717
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,520
to quit this case?

718
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
No, Boss.

719
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
It's not easy for Mr. Zhou to handle this case.

720
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Pei Su is in the department.

721
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
He asked Pei Su to wait for his brother and he trusts him.

722
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Pei Su,

723
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Zhou Huai Xing is so stubborn.

724
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
What's the matter?

725
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
There are rumors

726
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
that Mr. Zhou,

727
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
who is highly respected,

728
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
has a illegitimate child.

729
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Captain Luo, I've checked Dong County.

730
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
I'm reporting to you now.

731
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Dong County is a county-based city.

732
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
He got married and his wife died.

733
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
He has no family and he lives alone.

734
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
He has no bad habits and his life is simple.

735
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
His income is not bad.

736
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
He has six-digit savings and a house under his name.

737
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
A year's report shows

738
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
that he has high blood pressure.

739
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
His blood pressure is normal.

740
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
What's the matter?

741
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I don't want to rule out his murder.

742
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
I'm right.

743
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
According to you,

744
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
he is old and small.

745
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
He has no burden at home and he is generous.

746
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Is it a rare case

747
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
that he takes such a time-sensitive task?

748
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Well...

749
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Dong County has been driving for so many years and there has been no accident.

750
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Since he has been in a good mood and his body is fine,

751
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
why did he have such an accident today?

752
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
To make sure

753
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
if he is a murderer or not,

754
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
it's not a good idea to use a poor method

755
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
to rule out your imagination.

756
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
If possible,

757
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
we'd better find a source of evidence

758
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
to prove it.

759
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
Our investigation is most important

760
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
to predict and guess in advance.

761
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Don't you have a daughter in Dong County?

762
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Yes. Her name is Dong Xiao Qing.

763
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,520
Go to find her.

764
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Okay, we'll go to find her now.

765
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
Let's go.

766
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Go to ask her questions?

767
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Let's go.

768
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Why did you say that was a rumor?

769
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
What?

770
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
A private?

771
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Because I don't believe it.

772
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
If there really was such a person,

773
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
the Zhou family would have already let him come back.

774
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
Anyway, what's the point?

775
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Anyway, Mr. Zhou

776
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
has always been a good person.

777
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Even if he had lost money in the past,

778
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
he should have had that once.

779
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
And he's done a lot of work in the past few decades.

780
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
He should have been able to turn around.

781
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Besides, his wife has been dead for many years.

782
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
She shouldn't have said anything.

783
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Although people don't know what they're doing,

784
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
I believe that

785
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
with Mr. Zhou's personal rest,

786
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
he shouldn't have hidden his past.

787
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Don't you think so,

788
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Mr. Zhou?

789
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
But these things

790
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
are not completely out of the blue.

791
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Zhou Jun Hao's wife

792
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
is a very important person.

793
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Even if she died a normal death,

794
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
someone would still be able to prove that she was a good person.

795
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Not to mention the real thing.

796
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Zhou Huan Xing is the heir to Zhou's legacy.

797
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
No matter if this matter is true or not,

798
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
there will always be other people

799
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
who will use this as a pretext to do things.

800
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,520
If Zhou Huan Xing didn't cry and shout

801
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
to ask the special investigation team

802
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
to investigate this matter,

803
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
what kind of decisions would others make for him?

804
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
After all,

805
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
everyone thinks that Ma Er Kang and Dao Na Ben

806
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
killed their father.

807
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
What?

808
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Did Lu Dong Yue see this scene?

809
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
This is

810
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
the truth.

811
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
You just said that you are a martyr.

812
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Do you usually also do these memorials?

813
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
We don't have much to do

814
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
in this society.

815
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
It's okay to read some memorials.

816
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Spend some time to read some love letters.

817
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
What?

818
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Do you have to report these to the officer?

819
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
I don't know.

820
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
I don't know.

821
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
I don't know.

822
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
I don't know.

823
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Do you use Dao Na Ben

824
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
as a reference

825
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
to indicate how their marital affairs are?

826
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Zhou Huan Xing had a ...

827
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
mute child,

828
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
like beanbag and

829
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
with Zhou Shi Ke's brother

830
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:49,880
and there is an

831
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,880
As far as I know, you didn't do anything wrong during your youth.

832
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
You're a single parent.

833
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Then why did you have to be so close to your father?

834
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Mei Su.

835
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Captain Luo.

836
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Don't you think it's hard for a person to fight for his own blood and success?

837
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Views, habits, personality, temperament, moral standards, culture, and cultivation.

838
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Things that can change in the future are like the job of a plant.

839
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
You can change your personality.

840
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,880
As long as you want, you can change your personality to any direction.

841
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,880
But it's hard to change something deeper and more essential.

842
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Like genes.

843
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,880
That's what you've been carrying for too long.

844
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
It follows the journey of your blood and success.

845
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880
It's in every cell in your body.

846
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
Captain Luo.

847
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
For an ordinary person,

848
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,880
you might never realize the impact he has on you.

849
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
But when he's in a bad mood,

850
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
you'll realize

851
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,880
that this might be just a little bit of a flaw in your microchip.

852
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
It will affect your life.

853
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
I'm sorry.

854
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
I'm sorry.

855
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
I'm sorry.

856
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
I'm sorry.

857
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,880
I'm sorry.

858
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
I'm sorry.

859
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
I'm sorry.

860
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
I'm sorry.

861
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
I'm sorry.

862
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
I'm sorry.

863
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm sorry.

864
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
I'm sorry.

865
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm sorry.

866
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm sorry.

867
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,880
I'm sorry.

868
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm sorry.

869
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
I'm sorry.

870
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
I'm sorry.

871
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
I'm sorry.

872
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
I'm sorry.

874
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
I'm sorry.

875
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
I'm sorry.

876
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
I'm sorry.

877
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,880
I'm sorry.

878
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
I'm sorry.

880
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I'm sorry.

881
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm sorry.

882
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
I'm sorry.

883
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
I'm sorry.

884
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I'm sorry.

885
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
I'm sorry.

886
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
I'm sorry.

887
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
I'm sorry.

888
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
I'm sorry.

889
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
I'm sorry.

890
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
I'm sorry.

891
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,880
I'm sorry.

892
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
I'm sorry.

893
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
I'm sorry.

894
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm sorry.

895
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
I'm sorry.

896
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm sorry.

897
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
I'm sorry.

898
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
I'm sorry.

899
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I'm sorry.

900
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm sorry.

903
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I'm sorry.

905
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
I'm sorry.

906
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
I'm sorry.

908
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm sorry.

909
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
I'm sorry.

911
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
I'm sorry.

912
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
I'm sorry.

913
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm sorry.

914
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,880
I'm sorry.

915
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm sorry.

916
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,880
I'm sorry.

917
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm sorry.

918
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
I'm sorry.

919
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm sorry.

920
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
I'm sorry.

921
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm sorry.

922
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
I'm sorry.

923
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
I'm sorry.

924
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
I'm sorry.

925
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
I'm sorry.

926
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
I'm sorry.

927
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm sorry.

928
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,880
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
