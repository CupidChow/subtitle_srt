1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
to replace.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,900
I will never eat VAD for the moment.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,960
Oh my, why don't you take another bite?

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Put on the sliced pine nuts.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Oil temperature is the water on the surface of pine nuts.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
It will quickly disappear.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,960
The aroma will be reduced.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Mom,

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
you said that my mom is a pork chop chef.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
What are you doing?

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
I already said that

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
she is a low-level professional.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Red braised pork is not good.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
You have to stew it.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Why do you say that red braised pork is unhealthy?

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Look, the seasoning is wrong.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
The salt is also wrong.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Don't mention the fire.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
I guess that you eat it for the bottom of the pan.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
You don't even eat the bottom of the pan.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,960
What did you say you were blocking her?

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Hide behind her.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
At most, you will get a good chance.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Didn't you plan to open a

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
professional pervert who killed people without a trace?

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,120
In the

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
Maikua Street,

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
you set up a trap to save people.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
What are you laughing at?

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
You are really a good person.

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
You are really a good person.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
You are really a good person.

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
You are really a good person.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Hello?

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm not talking to you.

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Hello?

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
What's the matter?

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Isn't it convenient for you to answer the call now?

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I didn't talk to you.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
How is it?

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
What's the progress today?

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
There is news about Zheng Kaifeng.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
If you have time,

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
I will inform you about the case.

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Continue talking.

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Hey, don't move.

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,640
Did you turn on the free chat?

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,000
Why do I have a reply?

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,440
Is Pei Su beside you?

50
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Yes.

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Pei Su, how do you feel today?

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
When we went to see you a few days ago,

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
you were still unconscious.

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
Did you see the fruit I bought you?

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,320
Xiao Qiao also brought you a bear.

56
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,360
Did you see it?

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
That day scared us to death.

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
You didn't know.

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Old Luo...

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,240
He can't talk now.

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
He can't eat either.

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
The fruit is all in his mouth.

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
Enough, stop talking.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you looking for me?

65
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
Wei Zhao, you were right.

66
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,960
The key evidence has appeared.

67
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
I didn't mean to hurt you.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
I was just being nice.

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Hello, SID.

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
In the morning,

72
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I got a call from the safe zone.

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
There was a resident who had been at home for a few days

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
and smelled a strange smell.

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,360
The colleagues of the police team found a group of men in the living room.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,360
When we were collecting clues about the perpetrators,

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,960
we sent an email to each district.

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,760
There was a picture of the victim on it.

79
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,160
That's why they immediately

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,760
gave us the information.

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Did you find the identity of the deceased?

82
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,360
The evidence left by the deceased in the living room

83
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
is fake.

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,160
But we compared the DNA and the photo

85
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
and found the real identity of the person

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
in the detective's database.

87
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
The detective?

88
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
That's right.

89
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,160
The deceased, Wang Li, was a fugitive.

90
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,960
He was a long-distance car driver.

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
He killed the family because of gambling.

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
He kept running away.

93
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,160
Someone knocked Wang Li's door

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,960
on the day of Dong Xiaoqing's murder.

95
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,160
It's Zheng Qi.

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
coke

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Why does it go in that way?

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,760
He's the most suspicious person in our life.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Come on.

100
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,400
sc seek revenge

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,280
you probably can Le b bearing

102
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
what we discovered on the side of that

103
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,860
Zheng Kaifeng's fingerprints

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,740
have worked

105
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,140
These evidences are indeed very important,

106
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,940
but they are too direct.

107
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,540
Zheng Kaifeng has been working in the camp for so many years.

108
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,340
He even asked him to personally punish a killer.

109
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,540
He really went too far.

110
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,140
Wei Zhao,

111
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
did you ask about Bei Su?

112
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
About the person who did it?

113
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,140
I don't know.

114
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,540
I don't know.

115
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,940
I don't know.

116
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,540
I don't know.

117
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,140
I don't know.

118
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,940
I don't know.

119
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,540
I don't know.

120
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,340
I don't know.

121
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,940
I don't know.

122
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,740
I don't know.

123
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,540
I don't know.

124
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,340
I don't know.

125
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,140
I don't know.

126
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,940
I don't know.

127
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
I don't know.

128
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,740
I don't know.

129
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,940
I always have this feeling

130
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,940
that you know more about these cases than we do.

131
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
I also know

132
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,740
that in your villa,

133
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,740
you hid a lot of things.

134
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,140
You hid a lot of things.

135
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,940
Sleep.

136
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,740
Don't fall asleep in our dreamland.

137
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,740
The Long Ballad

138
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,740
Episode 16

139
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,740
With the complete introduction of SID,

140
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,340
the case of Zhou's chain is finally exposed.

141
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,740
Zhou Junhao's car accident,

142
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,340
Zhou's fourth son was stabbed,

143
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
and was proven to be related to

144
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,940
Fu Dongzheng and Dong Miyang.

145
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,340
The above two people also died

146
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,540
on the spot

147
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,740
due to an suicide attack on the escape route.

148
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,200
The only survivor of this

149
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,340
Hao's Grief,

150
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,340
Zhou's heir, Zhou Huaijing,

151
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,540
was also kidnapped before the incident,

152
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,140
and was kidnapped by the SID.

153
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,540
The SID has handed over the case results

154
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,140
to the Xinzhou government.

155
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,340
The Xinzhou government decided

156
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,940
to report on the violation of public order

157
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,740
and the manipulation of the securities market.

158
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,340
So, the case of Hao's Grief

159
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,740
has finally been exposed.

160
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Although Zhou Junhao's heir was not

161
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,140
a SID,

162
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,940
the public panic was not reduced.

163
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,340
In the place we can't see,

164
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,140
is there still a SID

165
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,940
with a successful man's mask

166
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,740
hiding around us

167
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,340
and threatening our lives?

168
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,140
Although this is a false alarm,

169
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,140
but suspicions,

170
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,740
confusions,

171
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,340
and suspicions

172
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,740
have been planted in our hearts

173
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,340
like seeds.

174
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,540
32 years ago,

175
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,740
Zheng Kaifeng and Zhou Junhao

176
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,940
were killed in the central Asian country

177
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,340
and officially took over Zhou's Group.

178
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,940
Later, this group of gold partners

179
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,540
seized the development of Xinzhou Port.

180
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,140
How could you do this?

181
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
How could you three

182
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,340
be so evil?

183
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,740
21 years ago,

184
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Zhou's Group entered the Xinzhou Port market

185
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,340
and bought murderers.

186
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
In the process,

187
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,540
the board members were involved for no reason.

188
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
Dong and I were wives,

189
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
but we were kept in the dark.

190
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,540
In the helpless sadness,

191
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,340
we lived an ordinary life.

192
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
But his name

193
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,140
was written on the board by the devil.

194
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,140
Hello, your flowers are ready.

195
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,540
Thank you.

196
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,340
Mr. Xiao,

197
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,540
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,540
I can only choose this way.

199
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,340
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,940
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,940
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,940
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,940
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,940
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,940
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,900
Yuan Tiny

214
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,060
Six modules Liang

215
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
Six modules Wei

216
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Seven modules Li

217
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,900
and Caitlin

218
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Six lives like sixarez

219
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,240
hit the power of Zhou's

220
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,740
transnational giant at the same time.

221
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,680
Killing,

222
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,380
robbing,

223
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,940
and offending in transultaries.

224
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,200
The theme of a modern legend

225
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
spoon-fy to the west

226
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,880
dried up by the washing sea

227
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,880
The Untamed

228
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Episode 16

229
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Mr. Zhou, do you feel better?

230
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Thank you for your hard work.

231
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Actually, I don't quite understand one thing.

232
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Why did Zheng Kaifeng

233
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,880
kill Ling Zun at this time?

234
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Zhou Junhao has been in good health these years.

235
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
But during the last year's examination,

236
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
the test showed a shadow on his chest.

237
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Although Zheng Shi was in a state of shock,

238
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
it was a big shock to him.

239
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
In the past one or two years,

240
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
he mentioned the death of a doctor many times.

241
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Huai Xing must have mentioned it to you, right?

242
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
It's impossible for him to leave me

243
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
the death of a doctor.

244
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
The death of Yichen is naturally due to Huai Xing.

245
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
You know Huai Xing.

246
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Although he is a little clever,

247
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
he can't take over

248
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
his business, especially his black and white business.

249
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Mr. Zhou,

250
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
what are your plans in the future?

251
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I'm going to report to the post-mortem now.

252
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
If it weren't for the heart attack,

253
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
I wouldn't be here.

254
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
What are you going to do?

255
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Besides, I have to continue

256
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
to cooperate with Zhou Shi's investigation.

257
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
You didn't participate in

258
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
the recent murder cases

259
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
without the right to make a decision.

260
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
In a strict sense,

261
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
you are still one of the victims.

262
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
In addition to the kidnapping case,

263
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
there are many other things

264
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
that can't be involved with you.

265
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Please forgive me.

266
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Thank you.

267
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Thank you.

268
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
But I still have a doubt in my heart.

269
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Brother Zhou,

270
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
you don't mind if I say this, do you?

271
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I suddenly feel that

272
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
you and your brother,

273
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
you and Ling Tang,

274
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
all the sadness is due to

275
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Zhou Junhao's

276
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
unconfirmed testimony.

277
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
He just randomly

278
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
made a mistake.

279
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
I've been

280
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
thinking about this for a long time.

281
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Besides,

282
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
there are many doubts

283
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
about this case.

284
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Let's not talk about details.

285
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Just say something that

286
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
makes me most confused.

287
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
You knew Zheng Kaifeng since you were a child.

288
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Do you think he's the kind of person

289
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
who would kill himself

290
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
without a reason?

291
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
What do you mean?

292
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
And Yang Bo.

293
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Yang Bo is useless.

294
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Even the position where he climbs Dongmi

295
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
is a question.

296
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
What does Zheng Kaifeng

297
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
like about

298
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
such a qualified person?

299
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
We killed Zhou Junhao and brought him here.

300
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
You also ran away with him.

301
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Don't you think it's strange?

302
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I'm afraid we can only

303
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
find out here.

304
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
We'll find out the things

305
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
that happened abroad.

306
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
But have you ever thought

307
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
if there are other people behind this?

308
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
If Zheng Kaifeng

309
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
is just a chess piece?

310
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
You have my contact information.

311
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
And

312
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
I always feel that

313
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
the things that have been in the safe

314
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
for a lifetime

315
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
are not just a

316
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
good piece of information.

317
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
What do you think?

318
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Hello.

319
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Miss,

320
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
are you looking for a room

321
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
because you're sick?

322
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
I feel that

323
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
my room will shine

324
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
even after you stand here for a while.

325
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm sorry.

328
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Where do you want to go?

333
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm familiar with the hospital

334
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
here.

335
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Can I walk with you?

336
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Do you know

337
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
a person called Ruo Weizhao?

338
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
She's my colleague.

339
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
May I ask who you are?

340
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
That's right.

341
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Take this for me.

342
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
I'm her neighbor.

343
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
She said that she had something to do today

344
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
and couldn't come.

345
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
She's been in the hospital

346
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
with my husband for two days.

347
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
So she stole

348
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
your food

349
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
from me.

350
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
I made you some pork soup today.

351
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
You must like it.

352
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Thank you.

353
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
But

354
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
you're married.

355
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
You're really good at talking.

356
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
My son is as tall

357
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
as a pole.

358
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
You think I'm a girl?

359
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Maybe,

360
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
but I don't like it.

361
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
You think I have this thing?

362
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Yes, you do.

363
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Anyway,

364
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Mine,

365
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Even if you can't emigrate

366
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
after you get used to it,

367
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
there won't be a requirement

368
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
in the form of treatment.

369
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
You should be careful

370
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
that you're not

371
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
in drunk-word beeache.

372
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
That's my reason.

373
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Four fingers under the foot

374
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
What song is the foot angry?

375
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
It's really hard for you to run around

376
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
It's okay, you don't have to send me

377
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Then you walk slowly

378
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
I was talking well just now

379
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Why did you suddenly get polite?

380
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Should be

381
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
What's wrong?

382
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Auntie, take care

383
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Be safe

384
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I haven't been a girl for less than half an hour

385
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm back to being an auntie

386
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
It's because you

387
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
It looks too young

388
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
I can't see it

389
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
I can't see it

390
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I can't see it

391
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
I can't see it

392
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I read it wrong

393
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
So I'm really sorry

394
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
It's okay

395
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Actually, I really like to chat with you

396
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
You don't know

397
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
I haven't had time to praise me for a long time

398
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
I have to go back and give me a big thumbs up

399
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Xian Bai Xian Bai

400
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Bye bye

401
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm back

402
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I'm back

403
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I'm back

404
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm back

405
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm back

406
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm back

407
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm back

408
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I'm back

409
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm back

410
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
I'm back

411
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
I'm back

412
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm back

413
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
I'm back

414
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
I'm back

415
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm back

416
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm back

417
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm back

418
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,880
go

419
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
Go

420
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Go

421
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,440
Let me point the knife out and I'll shoot him a good one

422
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,520
who would use tasty wanna-sheep

423
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,120
You are here

424
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,880
Find what you can

425
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,080
Visit bottles

426
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,440
i need to know

427
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,160
That you need to opt out

428
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,880
This is the new pair of shoes I prepared for you.

429
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,080
Is it suitable?

430
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,320
Although the case is over,

431
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,480
the person hiding behind hasn't appeared yet.

432
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,800
For safety,

433
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,200
you've been staying with me

434
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,680
for the past few days.

435
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,960
Pinggui,

436
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,720
we have a guest.

437
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,600
We agreed not to run around.

438
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,160
Pinggui.

439
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh my god.

440
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,000
Stand up.

441
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,600
Go to your own house.

442
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,400
Sit anywhere.

443
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,720
From now on,

444
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm your half-brother.

445
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,360
You two should live under the same roof.

446
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,400
You two

447
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,880
should be closer.

448
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,080
What did the publicity label say?

449
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,280
Lack of communication

450
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,840
is the source of the friendship.

451
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
As the head of the family,

452
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,040
I don't agree.

453
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Feed him.

454
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,760
By the way,

455
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,440
help me check the market.

456
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,400
I'll cook first.

457
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,600
You really don't recognize me?

458
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,720
The cat likes to hide.

459
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,840
Are you a cat?

460
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,440
Touch it.

461
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,120
Is it cute?

462
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,360
The blood of the half-bred person

463
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,280
on your body

464
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,400
must be dealt with well.

465
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
I'll go to the market.

466
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I'll go to the market.

467
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
I'll go to the market.

468
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I'll go to the market.

469
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
I'll go to the market.

470
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I'll go to the market.

471
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
I'll go to the market.

472
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,520
Let go.

473
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:26,920
Clever.

474
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,280
You don't have to know

475
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,520
why you didn't trailers yourself.

476
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Remember.

477
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,040
You and me

478
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,320
No need to fear.

479
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,020
His life

480
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,560
needs us to 然後他們的生死是天生就該由我們來掌握。

481
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,180
to master in their lives.

482
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:02,980
Let's go.

483
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,500
Florence's

484
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,320
massage control room

485
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,740
No, my private.

486
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,420
It's annoying.

487
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,600
Let's just have a transcript.

488
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,640
Okay, sure.

489
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,820
I'm going to have a look.

490
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,580
I'm going to give you this right away.

491
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,240
Thanks.

492
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,700
Okay.

493
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,640
Wash your hands.

494
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,840
You were in the toilet just now.

495
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,640
You were in the trash can for a long time.

496
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Stop looking.

497
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,640
Go wash your hands.

498
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,040
You sleep here these days.

499
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,040
I slept in the study with Ping.

500
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
The mattress is a bit hard.

501
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,240
I don't know if you're used to it.

502
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Senior.

503
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,040
Are you looking at me?

504
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
If you're not used to it,

505
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,640
change the mattress tomorrow.

506
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Senior,

507
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,640
don't you have any other things to do?

508
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I'm going to sleep.

509
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
I'm going to sleep.

510
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm going to sleep.

511
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
Senior,

512
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
don't you have anything to ask me?

513
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,240
This is your first question.

514
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,240
This is very important to me.

515
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Don't let her know that you're the one who did it.

516
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
There's no reason.

517
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,440
Just seeing the light flashed in front of the car.

518
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,240
At that time, I understood you were right.

519
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
This is a trap.

520
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,640
Everything happened too quickly.

521
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,240
I couldn't afford to make it turn over.

522
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
It's just that Xie Yizhi pushed you out.

523
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,440
If you want to die,

524
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,080
Don't waste your trust on things like this.

525
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,080
I don't know.

526
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,260
Do you know that

527
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,480
Sonny's decision

528
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,920
to make us stay in the company

529
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
is really fast as a bullet τα hands-on investigation?

530
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,520
You and our son

531
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,340
are on the same side

532
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,880
in a very mapping chart.

533
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,740
RA has launched a 3D drawing

534
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
I don't know.

535
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Do you know?

536
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Senior,

537
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,340
I'll answer three questions.

538
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
I won't ask you.

539
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Okay.

540
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Second question.

541
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,140
Second question.

542
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,740
What are you investigating?

543
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,140
To make you feel like you can give up your life.

544
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,140
Senior, you really ask me every question

545
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,940
so that I can't help but wonder.

546
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
Go ahead.

547
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
You know,

548
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,340
I've always suspected that Pei Cheng Yu

549
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,940
has a long-term personal relationship with my mother.

550
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,540
Even if you've ruled out her suspicion,

551
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,540
I still have this feeling in my heart.

552
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,740
I can't get it back.

553
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,140
In theory,

554
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,540
a person's intuition has something to do with his subconscious.

555
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,740
So I really want to know

556
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,940
why I have this deep doubt in my heart.

557
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,540
So I'm trying to track down what happened to me when I was a kid.

558
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Track down?

559
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,140
How do you track down?

560
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,940
Do you still remember

561
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,140
the 13th District Ice Sea Bay Project?

562
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,740
We have a basement.

563
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,140
Only Pei Cheng Yu has a key.

564
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,740
My mother and I can't get close.

565
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,540
I accidentally broke into the country.

566
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
It's there.

567
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,540
I saw the project book of the 13th District Ice Sea Bay Project.

568
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,140
That project wanted Pei Cheng Yu to invest,

569
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
but he didn't see it.

570
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
The reason is

571
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
there is no mature model.

572
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,740
So your father is like Zhou Shiyu.

573
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,740
It's related to the Guangyao Foundation.

574
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,940
Not only that,

575
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,340
they used to be close partners.

576
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,740
I took over the company and found out

577
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,140
that Pei Cheng Yu once gave a charity foundation

578
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,940
under Guangyao to donate a lot of money.

579
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,340
The company's management was not regular in the early years.

580
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,740
It's hard to find many accounts.

581
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,340
But from that information,

582
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,140
this Guangyao Foundation not only has a long history,

583
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,340
but also the projects they worked with

584
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,140
almost have no profit.

585
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,740
I know Pei Cheng Yu.

586
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,540
He is like Zheng Kaifeng.

587
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,740
He is

588
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,940
that kind of person.

589
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,540
Lack of sympathy,

590
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,940
and greedy.

591
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,540
This is Pei Cheng Yu's more arrogant attitude.

592
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,740
He is self-disciplined and has the reputation of being a good person.

593
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
He is very smart.

594
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,340
But at that time, many investment projects

595
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,940
seemed very ridiculous.

596
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,940
It seemed like they would lose.

597
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,140
He would lose again and again.

598
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
I really don't believe it.

599
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,740
What projects did they invest in

600
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
during this period?

601
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,940
They invested in everything.

602
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,140
But most of them went overseas.

603
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,940
So it's hard to find out

604
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,540
the specific use of these funds.

605
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,740
But I think it's not hard for you

606
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,540
to guess

607
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,340
what they invested in.

608
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,140
I think it's not hard for you to guess.

609
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,540
But

610
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
three years ago,

611
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Pei's investment in the Guangyao Foundation

612
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
was terminated.

613
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,340
Three years ago?

614
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,540
You are really smart.

615
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,140
Just before Pei Cheng Yu got into a car accident,

616
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
he was in the car.

617
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,140
So I always think

618
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,740
Pei Cheng Yu's car accident was not an accident.

619
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,740
Anything else?

620
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,740
Nothing.

621
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
What does the Lingdu Project

622
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,340
have to do with this?

623
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,940
Senior,

624
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
is this your third question?

625
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,140
Yes.

626
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,140
Third question.

627
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,140
Please.

628
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,140
Why did you suddenly stop working in my hometown?

629
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,940
I'm sorry.

630
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,940
I'm sorry.

631
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,540
I'm sorry.

632
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,140
I'm sorry.

633
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,340
I'm sorry.

634
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm sorry.

635
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,740
I'm sorry.

636
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,740
I'm sorry.

637
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,740
I'm sorry.

638
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,740
I'm sorry.

639
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,740
I'm sorry.

640
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,740
I'm sorry.

641
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,740
I'm sorry.

642
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,740
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
I'm sorry.

644
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,940
I'm sorry.

645
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,140
I'm sorry.

646
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,340
I'm sorry.

647
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
I'm sorry.

648
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
I'm sorry.

649
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
I'm sorry.

650
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm sorry.

651
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
I'm sorry.

652
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,540
I'm sorry.

653
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm sorry.

655
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,340
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,540
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,740
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I'm sorry.

661
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
I'm sorry.

662
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
I'm sorry.

667
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,340
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
I'm sorry.

670
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,340
I'm sorry.

673
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
I'm sorry.

677
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
I'm sorry.

678
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:48,640
I'ts fine even if only we havecheering

679
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,540
It's too late now I can't staple

680
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,780
ать

681
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,540
I want to be more honest with each other.

682
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,540
When you want to talk to me, talk to me again.

683
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
It's late. Go to sleep.

684
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
I'm going to sleep.

685
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,540
I'm going to sleep.

686
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,540
I'm going to sleep.

687
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,540
I'm going to sleep.

688
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,540
I'm going to sleep.

689
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,540
I'm going to sleep.

690
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,540
I'm going to sleep.

691
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540
The case of the previous suspect is quite old.

692
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
It's the case of the previous suspect,

693
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
the one who investigated the last time about the Lingdu Project.

694
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
If you ask Mr. Pan later,

695
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,540
just tell him that he understands.

696
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,540
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

697
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Later, the special investigation team locked a suspect.

698
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,540
But there was no evidence to charge him.

699
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,540
We only know that he's been to the Lingdu Project.

700
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
We all know him.

701
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
He's the one who was the suspect.

702
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
He's the one who was the suspect.

703
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,140
Wait a little more.

704
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,540
I hear more occasionally that you talk to me.

705
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,540
If you have more false suspicions,

706
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,540
I'll talk with the SAR Texas Department Pre업 exclude you.

707
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
I see.

708
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
You said you wanted to read rock,

709
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,540
which I didn't expect you read Mr. Pan's talk.

710
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,500
Hello, Mr. Du.

711
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,340
Help me check Pan Yunheng and Du Zuo's

712
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,260
graduation list of Bixin State.

713
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,580
The sooner the better.

714
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,180
The heart is frozen.

715
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,100
Even if it's broken, it'll be reborn.

716
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,100
It's as easy as that.

717
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,980
I touch the tomorrow with my hands.

718
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,140
The future is still uncertain.

719
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,740
I'll be silent for the rest of my life.

720
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,740
I'm still willing to freeze the world.

721
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,860
Even if the pain is gone,

722
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,820
I'll be brave.

723
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,660
I sing my heart out, but I have no words.

724
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,740
My heart is in my fingertips.

725
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:59,020
I've tried so many times to show my true self.

726
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,060
I call out to you from the bottom of my heart.

727
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,500
The night is blown away.

728
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,820
I'll wait in the white light.

729
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,420
I don't know if I'll ever wake up.

730
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,460
I'll try my best to come back to the color in my dream.

731
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,700
I won't be wrong.

732
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,140
I'm just a white bird.

733
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,140
I just want to move forward.

734
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,020
I just want to move forward.

735
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,460
I'll heal my wounds alone.

736
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,260
I'll be the wind in the dark night.

737
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,860
I'll keep moving forward.

738
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,780
I'll keep moving forward.

739
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,900
I'll pass through the fog.

740
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,700
I'll be silent for the rest of my life.

741
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,420
I'll be silent for the rest of my life.

742
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,260
I'll be in the dark night.
