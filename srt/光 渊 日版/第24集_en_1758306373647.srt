00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,900
government

6
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,100
充满了意外事件的一天。

7
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,380
这一天是往事的终结,

8
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,340
又是未来事件的开端。

9
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,220
他揭示了一些令人震惊的事实,

10
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,540
但又使人更加困惑莫解。

11
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,340
您刚刚收听到的是

12
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,620
齐明月度出品的名著赏稀。

13
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,780
莫奖,庆礼者。

14
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,420
感谢您的...

15
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,540
这一张总算结束了。

16
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,740
杜国生都认罪了。

17
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740
封闭。

18
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
三二七。

19
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,940
就等了公诉。

20
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
你打算怎么办?

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,020
是接着在我这儿干,

22
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,580
还是打算去体验一下

23
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,300
不一样的生活?

24
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,980
这一张总算结束了。

25
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,860
你是认为我吃 Filipino Food

26
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,980
出那外面的温 abundante,

27
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,220
但我要拍到她。

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
你是不是?

29
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,620
我痛恨自己

30
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,420
parsupt歇也你了

31
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,140
学校现场。

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
I've heard from my teacher that

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
thousands of years ago,

34
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
there was a line

35
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,900
that could change the genes of a person.

36
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
This is a strange way to say it.

37
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Think about it.

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
If

39
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
a person's character,

40
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
cultivation,

41
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
and experience

42
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
are the softwares

43
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
that can be removed from a person,

44
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
then the genes are definitely the hardwares.

45
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
If the genes change,

46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
then you won't

47
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
just become an artificial intelligence

48
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
from a robot?

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Even if I have the same memories

50
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I'm not the same person as before.

51
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,900
Sometimes,

52
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
I always feel

53
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,900
that a newbie is the same

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
as this newbie.

55
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
He can also

56
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
change a person's face

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,900
to a different person.

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,900
When you look at others

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
in the mirror,

60
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
you'll be a little confused.

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
You'll wonder

62
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
how I became like this.

63
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
I don't even know myself.

64
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Look at these people in the mirror.

65
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,900
What they're after

66
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
is not just

67
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
cars,

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
houses,

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
careers, love,

70
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
and dreams.

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
They're busy every day.

72
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
They're all full of

73
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
worries and happiness.

74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,900
They're really emotional,

75
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
happy,

76
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
and serious.

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
They don't know what's called a misunderstanding.

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
They always feel that today

79
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
and yesterday

80
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,900
are the same as tomorrow.

81
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
They don't feel

82
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
that I'm a ant

83
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
floating in the river in tears.

84
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
I'm a moving bat.

85
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,900
But it's different with you.

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
You can't live

87
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
like this.

88
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
You're like...

89
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
like a hen

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
that's been soaked in the rain.

91
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
From now on,

92
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
from now on,

93
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,900
you can't make a deal with them.

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Look at them.

95
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
They think that what they're after

96
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
is just a process of evolution.

97
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
You can't believe it.

98
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Just say it's beautiful.

99
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Have you done it every day?

100
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
You're a busy man.

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
You're full of dreams,

102
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
anxiety, and anxiety.

103
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
You're so nervous.

104
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
When people look at you,

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
you think they're not good enough.

106
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
When someone stops you

107
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
and asks you for directions,

108
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
you think they're not good enough.

109
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
You even

110
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
see someone

111
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
running away and running away.

112
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
You think they're not good enough.

113
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
You're a bad person.

114
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
The sense of security

115
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
is the key to the environment.

116
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Without it,

117
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
you can only stay in a state of emergency

118
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
and stay in the rain.

119
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
It's painful.

120
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
Even if the window is closed...

121
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
It's impossible.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
It's impossible forever.

123
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Like a snake,

124
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
it's deep in the bone.

125
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
It's so hard to get in.

126
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Even if you find the murderer,

127
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
you can't get out.

128
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
The abyss is also watching you.

129
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
I don't know if you ever think like that.

130
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Sometimes I feel

131
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
like a mental patient.

132
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Living

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
in a state of emergency

134
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
is really a tragedy.

135
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
I like to talk to you.

136
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
So you've been sitting here for a long time

137
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
and you haven't said a few words.

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
According to the general social etiquette,

139
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I should say a few words.

140
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
For example,

141
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
everything will get better.

142
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
Time will one day

143
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
lose memory and wisdom.

144
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Of course, it will also make the wound heal.

145
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
It's just nonsense.

146
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
You want to hear it, I'm too lazy to say it.

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
From the moment we came to this world,

148
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
we were constantly

149
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
being created by things outside.

150
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Sir, you can't choose.

151
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
You have to pass on your memories.

152
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
This is the environment.

153
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
The person you like

154
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
and the person you hate,

155
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
even if they are like a poisonous snake,

156
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
you can't be a bad person.

157
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
The murder squad will create

158
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,900
part of your flesh

159
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
through the wounds on the bed.

160
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
This is the truth.

161
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Whether you are willing to admit it

162
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
or not,

163
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
do you know what I will do?

164
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
I will cut off that flesh

165
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
and put out that blood.

166
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Then I will chop off

167
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
the bones of the lower organs.

168
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm not the one you love.

169
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I'm Shen Yue.

170
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
What are you rushing?

171
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
What are you rushing?

172
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Do you understand?

173
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Drive this car.

174
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
If you like it,

175
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
drive it out and relax.

176
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
I don't need it.

177
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
I don't need it.

178
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Let's go.

179
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Let's go.

180
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Let's go.

181
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Xiao Xiao Xiao, why are you still here?

182
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Well...

183
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
I'll stay a little longer.

184
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
How much does the organization give you?

185
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
You still work overtime on weekends?

186
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Do you want to go eat?

187
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
I'll treat you.

188
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Last time you helped me, I haven't thanked you yet.

189
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Then I won't be polite to you.

190
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
The next door is very fast, so I'll wait for you.

191
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Hurry up.

192
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,900
You're always slow. Hurry up.

193
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
I'm sorry.

199
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
Continue to observe.

200
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Your mother was rescued.

201
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
But the situation is not optimistic.

202
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
You have to be prepared.

203
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm sorry.

204
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm sorry.

205
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Hello?

206
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Hello?

207
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
I knew I could meet you here.

208
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Let's go.

209
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
I'm sorry.

210
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Come.

211
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
You've been working hard.

212
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
The burden on your shoulder is too heavy.

213
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Isn't it, sir?

214
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Since you've seen it,

215
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
you can find me a salary.

216
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
It's very stressful to support the family.

217
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
Get out of here.

218
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
You don't even have a home.

219
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
You have the nerve to mention it.

220
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
You don't even have a home.

221
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
You have the nerve to mention it.

222
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Besides, as SID,

223
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
this is what you should do.

224
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Can you tell me about

225
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
what happened to Huo Xiao?

226
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Huo Xiao.

227
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Your master is my everything.

228
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
He was also a famous person in school.

229
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
He didn't tell you about this?

230
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
How could he not tell me?

231
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Yang was bragging about everything.

232
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
He said that there were many girls

233
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
who liked him.

234
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I said it's impossible.

235
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
There are many girls in Xinzhou.

236
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Actually, not only Yang,

237
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Huo Xiao, Zhang, and Pan

238
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
are all my family.

239
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
They are all my family.

240
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Pan and I are all classmates.

241
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
When we were in school,

242
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
we were close.

243
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
We thought that after graduation,

244
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
we could solve some big cases

245
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
and do some business together.

246
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
But after graduation,

247
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
we found that there were no big cases to solve.

248
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
We didn't help people find dogs

249
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
or to solve the legal disputes.

250
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
It's easy to have a case

251
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
that we can coordinate with each other.

252
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Besides, the number of people is limited.

253
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,900
We can't solve daily cases.

254
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
When we encounter big cases,

255
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
no one will help us.

256
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Later, because of the difficulties,

257
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
some big cases

258
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
were not solved.

259
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
It caused the people's resentment.

260
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
The government asked the Supervision Bureau

261
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
to set up a special investigation team

262
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
to take charge of the major cases

263
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
across the region.

264
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
We were all excited

265
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
when we heard about it.

266
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Besides the old Pan who went back to school early,

267
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
we all survived.

268
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Then, we all came back

269
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
with a big plan.

270
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
When the special investigation team was set up,

271
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
the old cases

272
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
were all solved.

273
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
We had to calculate the money.

274
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
At that time,

275
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Xinzhou was like a different world.

276
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
The illegal people in each district

277
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
were investigated like chickens and dogs.

278
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
As long as it involves illegal crimes,

279
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
SID will investigate it.

280
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
In the end, it's not good

281
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
even if the king comes.

282
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
The seniors were busy

283
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
and didn't have time to take us.

284
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
The four of us were following

285
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:32,420
the

286
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
special investigation team.

287
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,420
They became the spy team.

288
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,420
We were all

289
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,420
in the special investigation team.

290
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
We were all together

291
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,420
and were together all day long.

292
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Except Yang,

293
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,420
who betrayed the organization early

294
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,420
and became a family.

295
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,420
We were all single men in the forest.

296
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Sometimes, we were all working together.

297
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
When they were free,

298
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
they would bring a box of rice and come to work.

299
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
Yang

300
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
had the most experience.

301
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
He was bold and hardworking.

302
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
He was the most capable.

303
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Zhang was the most generous

304
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
in his family.

305
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
He was the one who paid for the meals.

306
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
He was the best.

307
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
He was the most stubborn

308
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,420
and the most grumpy.

309
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
We had a fight for three days.

310
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
But we didn't have a fight.

311
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
After that, we got along well.

312
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
Huoxiao

313
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,420
The most

314
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
hardworking

315
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
and hardworking

316
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
in the world.

317
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,420
Huoxiao was the youngest.

318
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
At that time, she was called Huo Lao Wu.

319
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
She was kind and hardworking.

320
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,420
After graduation,

321
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
she spent her time in political and legal college

322
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
and studied another degree.

323
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
Later, those seniors

324
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
retired.

325
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
After that, Huoxiao became a deputy team player

326
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
We all support him.

327
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Because indeed,

328
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
no one has ever used his power.

329
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
The 327 case was the first major case

330
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,420
that was broken down

331
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,420
after Huo Xiao became the vice-captain.

332
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
It was once a chaos.

333
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
It was solved quite cleanly.

334
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,420
The only thing that was not good enough was

335
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,420
the case of Du Guosheng.

336
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,420
Until half a year later,

337
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Du Guosheng was drunk

338
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,420
and left a fingerprint.

339
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,420
Can you tell us

340
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
the cause of this case?

341
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
The fingerprint was found

342
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
by a forensic doctor

343
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,420
in charge of the case.

344
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
We heard that Du Guosheng was still in the country.

345
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
We were very excited, so we took the surveillance of the dance hall.

346
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,420
Who knows?

347
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,420
The surveillance of that house is basically on display.

348
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
We had been in the area for more than a week.

349
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Besides the investigation of

350
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
the two members of the crime team,

351
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
we didn't even see Du Guosheng's shadow.

352
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,420
Then we all left.

353
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
Huo Xiao never gave up on Si Xia Li.

354
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
During that time,

355
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
we knew that he was in a tight spot.

356
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
We didn't even ask him.

357
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
We all thought he was in love.

358
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Later, we realized

359
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
that Si Xia Li was the one who was in the dark.

360
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
I remember that day.

361
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
I remember that day.

362
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,420
Why didn't you tell me

363
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,420
what happened to Wu?

364
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
I didn't know

365
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,420
that he was in the dark.

366
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
I didn't know

367
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
that he was in the dark.

368
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,420
I didn't know

369
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
that he was in the dark.

370
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,420
I touched the string.

371
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,420
Lao Yang, Lao Yang.

372
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Calm down.

373
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,420
I didn't hear that boy

374
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
slander Wu.

375
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
I hit him.

376
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Calm down.

377
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
Wu is gone.

378
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Oh

379
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
Oh

380
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Oh

381
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,060
Drilly

382
00:29:42,420 --> 00:30:09,960
and

383
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Alright

384
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,960
The special investigation team had such a big scandal.

385
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
The person died.

386
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,960
All the files were sealed.

387
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
The case was closed.

388
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
There's something I find very strange.

389
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Why did Huo Xiao act alone?

390
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Director Du, it's time.

391
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Is there anything else you want to say?

392
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Director Du, please.

393
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Director Du, please.

394
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
If Huo Xiao was framed,

395
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,960
there's only one possibility.

396
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Our team is not clean.

397
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Hello, dad.

398
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,960
I want to look at the first 0 degree plan.

399
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Why do you suddenly want to look at this?

400
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
About someone who's hiding in the dark.

401
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I have some speculations that need to be confirmed.

402
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
I'll send you tomorrow.

403
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Director Du, please.

404
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Director Du, please.

405
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Director Du, please.

406
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
The suspect Du Guosheng has been arrested

407
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
for the murder of Ye Langgu.

408
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
The murderer has committed two serious crimes

409
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
in the last three years.

410
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
The criminal is not guilty.

411
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
He is now transferred to the surveillance agency

412
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
and is waiting for trial.

413
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Director Du, please.

414
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
During the trial,

415
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Du Guosheng also told us

416
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
that he was framed for escaping from the crime

417
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
and killed the detective Huo Xiao.

418
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
The county police is approved

419
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,960
to re-investigate the case of Sena and the case of Dapuo.

420
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

421
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

422
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

423
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

424
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

425
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Calm down!

426
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Calm down!

427
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Calm down! Don't be angry!

428
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

429
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Huo Huo is innocent!

430
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
This investigation will be conducted by the sixth team

431
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
and will be reported directly to the joint surveillance agency.

432
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
This is all the information we have so far.

433
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
We hope that more people can start the investigation.

434
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I know.

435
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Ten years have passed.

436
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
The evidence has been lost.

437
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
The victim and the witness were not killed

438
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
but left.

439
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
They were killed.

440
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
I don't know what happened to the victim.

441
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
It's not easy for the police to do this.

442
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
We have to investigate.

443
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
We have to investigate.

444
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
We have to investigate.

445
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
The police are not here.

446
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
They have to investigate.

447
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
We have to investigate.

448
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
The victim and the witness were not killed but left.

449
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
It's hard to investigate.

450
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
In the future, everyone may have to go to the factory.

451
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
There may be danger.

452
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
The long vacation of a year,

453
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
everyone may have to work ten miles.

454
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Others are at home, working online.

455
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Only we have to work with the northwest.

456
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
In this respect,

457
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
as a teacher who has been in love for many years,

458
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I am more qualified to speak for him.

459
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
And this is the case of the previous generation.

460
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
It seems that it has nothing to do with you.

461
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
In the end,

462
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
besides the overtime fee,

463
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
there is no other reward.

464
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,960
And the person in charge of this case

465
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
has been dead for so many years.

466
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
No one knows who Huo Xiao is.

467
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
He has no relatives or relatives after he died.

468
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
And no one will

469
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
ask him for an explanation at the door of the special investigation team.

470
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
He is no longer more impetuous than the dead.

471
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
He is buried under the ground.

472
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
No matter his identity,

473
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
criminal or a criminal,

474
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
it seems that it can not affect his quality of life.

475
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
But everyone,

476
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
is this the responsibility of our SID?

477
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
If this is a place where no one cares about whether or not it is right or wrong,

478
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
where no one is convinced by the black and white.

479
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
If we can't get through this,

480
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
it will be meaningless.

481
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Report!

482
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Get ready to start the work!

483
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Sena He You An,

484
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
ten years ago, was a large-scale joint venture.

485
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
The major shareholder in Jing Wan,

486
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
because it was too old, there was no more evidence.

487
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
The shareholder in Jing Wan lost his investment.

488
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Three years ago, it was cancelled.

489
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
But before that, it was basically operated in the way of a package company.

490
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Until now,

491
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Wei Zhan Hong Du, the head of the department, admitted that

492
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Sena He You An was once his business.

493
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
It may be that he was lying,

494
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
but it is also possible that there are real people behind it.

495
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Lao Mei Jia,

496
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
the witness of Sena He You An,

497
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
also a witness of the crime of

498
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
murder, arson, and a series of crimes.

499
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
His real name is Lin Tao.

500
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
He is 56 years old.

501
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
He is currently in the local area.

502
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
After the Sena He You An fire case,

503
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
he lost contact with SID.

504
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
He has been away from Xinzhou for many years.

505
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
In addition to Lao Mei Jia, there are four other witnesses.

506
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
They are all business owners who were said to have been looted by Huo Xiao.

507
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
I checked the internal net.

508
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Some are dead, some are not in Xinzhou.

509
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,960
This Lao Mei Jia's organ is in the local area?

510
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
Yes, in the south of Xinzhou.

511
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Contact the south of Xinzhou police

512
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
to investigate this Lao Mei Jia's family.

513
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
If this person is still alive,

514
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
we must find him. This person is very important.

515
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Yes.

516
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Others, check the capital behind Sena He You An

517
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
and other business owners.

518
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Meeting.

519
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Captain Luo,

520
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
let me go to the south to investigate this Lao Mei Jia.

521
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
No.

522
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Let Tao Ze go.

523
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Your communication efficiency is too low.

524
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
I can communicate.

525
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Captain Luo,

526
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
let me go.

527
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Captain Luo,

528
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I can do it.

529
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I can do it.

530
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
I can do it.

531
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Captain Luo, I can do it.

532
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
I can do it alone. Let me...

533
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Help me investigate a few people.

534
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
First, ask the head of the village.

535
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Feng Bin's net friend?

536
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Yes.

537
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
If Feng Bin's leads are limited,

538
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
you can go to the police station and meet Wei Wen Xuan.

539
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
See if you can find some new leads.

540
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Understood.

541
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Second,

542
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
I suspect this person

543
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
changed the surveillance camera of Long Yun Cheng twice

544
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
to let us see Du Guosheng.

545
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Check his bottom.

546
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Zhiyun.

547
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Lan Qiao.

548
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Why don't you come in?

549
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Boss, don't look at me like that.

550
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
I know the case we're investigating now is very important.

551
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
I also know you might suspect...

552
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
suspect your own people.

553
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Last time you asked Xiao Hai Yang

554
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
to secretly investigate Wei Zhanhong,

555
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
I knew it.

556
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
So?

557
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I definitely didn't eavesdrop.

558
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
I just wanted to come back

559
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
and ask you.

560
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
See if I can help.

561
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
I want to be with you.

562
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
I don't want to be expelled.

563
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
I feel so bad.

564
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
Okay.

565
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I'll send you with him.

566
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
What?

567
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
He loves to sit on the bull's-eye.

568
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
He's a little clumsy.

569
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
So I'll send you with him.

570
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
I...

571
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Don't worry, boss. We'll complete the mission.

572
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
Okay. I'm relieved to have you.

573
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Lan Qiao's father has already booked a ticket for her to go home.

574
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
I can do it by myself, Captain Luo.

575
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I've already withdrawn the ticket.

576
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
No, Captain Luo. I can do it by myself.

577
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Hurry up. Get to work.

578
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Captain Luo, I can do it by myself.

579
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Why are you so bad?

580
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
Captain Luo, Captain Luo.

581
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
What day is it today?

582
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
You're still pretending?

583
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
I want to be with you.

584
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
I don't want to be expelled.

585
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
I feel so bad.

586
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
You should have said it directly.

587
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Why are you so stubborn?

588
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Brother, from today on,

589
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
I'm a member of the Sixth Operation Team.

590
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
No matter what happens,

591
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
I'll be a part of it.

592
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
Okay. But from today on,

593
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
you're not allowed to act alone.

594
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
No matter where you go,

595
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
I have to know what you're going to do.

596
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Don't worry.

597
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
I'll work with the Sixth Operation Team.

598
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
By the way, Brother,

599
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
do you have the A-13 you asked me to check?

600
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
This is from the flight record.

601
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,160
It was taken from the

602
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
new house of the villagers.

603
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
He claims to be a new delivery man

604
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
who has been to the construction market.

605
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
He pulled a truck of porcelain and went there.

606
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,160
He was very confident.

607
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
That afternoon, he was playing cards with the villagers

608
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
near Jiayou Mountain

609
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
and watching the movement of the stray dogs.

610
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Do you have any evidence?

611
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
He was invaded by someone.

612
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
There was a monitor under the bed.

613
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
If we took a step back,

614
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
he could have killed Mu Yangquan.

615
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
He was watching Mu Yangquan

616
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,160
to prevent those people from

617
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
jumping off the walls and blowing up the ecological park.

618
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
But if the purpose of the cleaners

619
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
was to let Du Guosheng

620
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
officially get rid of the injustice,

621
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
it wouldn't be a big deal, right?

622
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
After all, the people living in the ecological park

623
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
are all wanted criminals.

624
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
Each of them has more than one life.

625
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
A long-term order can make them kill Du Guosheng.

626
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
You mean

627
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
there are people in that ecological park?

628
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm the one who has the most contact with Du Guosheng.

629
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
What do you think?

630
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I'll keep my eyes on him.

631
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
I'll keep my eyes on him.

632
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
Help me pack up and take the recent documents home.

633
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
I'll sort them out when I have time.

634
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,160
I'll go.

635
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,160
On the day of the explosion,

636
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Feng Chao did call me.

637
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,160
He asked me to give Du Guosheng a lead.

638
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
But I'm not like them.

639
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
I'm not like them.

640
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
I'm not like them.

641
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
I didn't do it.

642
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
Who are you to them?

643
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
You're from the new Zhou dynasty.

644
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Don't try this at home.

645
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Be honest.

646
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
They made a deal with me.

647
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
They said they wanted to keep Du Guosheng alive.

648
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
They said they wanted to keep Du Guosheng alive.

649
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
As for injuries or disabilities,

650
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
I don't care about them.

651
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
After the explosion,

652
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
they'll arrange for me to be sent to a safe place.

653
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
they'll arrange for me to be sent to a safe place.

654
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
Who are they?

655
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
I only know one.

656
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
A13.

657
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Where is it safe?

658
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Out of the country.

659
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
At least it's a place no one knows.

660
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
A13 told me that.

661
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
But I don't think

662
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
it's that safe.

663
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
But I don't think

664
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
A13 and our organization

665
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
are any good.

666
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,160
I think it's good.

667
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,160
I think it's good.

668
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
At least I can sleep well at night.

669
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
I don't have to worry about someone coming in at night to accompany me.

670
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
I don't have to worry about someone coming in at night to accompany me.

671
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,160
Is he the A13 you're talking about?

672
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
Yes.

673
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
You know him and the people behind him.

674
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
You know him and the people behind him.

675
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
They're

676
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
the spies inside us.

677
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
They're very cautious.

678
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,160
They can't show up in front of us easily.

679
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
They can't show up in front of us easily.

680
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,160
I've only seen A13.

681
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
What's wrong?

682
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Senior.

683
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
I just thought about it.

684
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,160
Don't you think we can catch Du Guosheng this time?

685
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
The reason why we came back is because Wang Xiao

686
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
pointed out that on the day on the 16th of October,

687
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
the surveillance cameras caught Du Guosheng meeting with Long Yun Cheng and Wei Wen Xuan.

688
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
the surveillance cameras caught Du Guosheng meeting with Long Yun Cheng and Wei Wen Xuan.

689
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
If it's not this clue,

690
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Wei Ranghong can still be the one to blame.

691
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
If it's not this clue,

692
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
we can't find Feng Chao at all.

693
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
It's even more impossible to find the foundation of the vocal cord.

694
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
It's even more impossible to find the foundation of the vocal cord.

695
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
Why do you think so?

696
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
Why do you think so?

697
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
Wang Xiao should be fine.

698
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,160
We asked him that day when we interrogated him.

699
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
Liang Yu Jin and those girls

700
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
also confirmed the authenticity of this painting.

701
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,160
The painting Wang Xiao heard that day...

702
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
Liang Yu Jin didn't have a bloodstain.

703
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
I'll go and get Yu Fen.

704
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,160
The day on the 16th of October is the day off.

705
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
The students are on vacation.

706
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
Those who can go home are all home.

707
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,160
Stop!

708
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
Stop!

709
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
Stop!

710
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Stop!

711
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
Stop!

712
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
I want to talk to you.

713
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
This is the recording.

714
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,160
This is the recording.

715
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
So Wang Xiao heard it.

716
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
What are you talking about?

717
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
That's the food for improvement.

718
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
This person doesn't seem to be from our school.

719
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,160
Are you sure?

720
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,160
I'm sure.

721
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
I patrol the school every day.

722
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,160
I know all the school workers.

723
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
No, he's not.

724
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,160
Hello, Wu.

725
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,160
The manager just sent me a note.

726
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Some of the information about the old girl has been leaked.

727
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Contact the security team and check it.

728
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Okay.

729
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
But Tao Fu, you have to wait a little longer.

730
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,160
The network is too bad.

731
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,160
Only a few pictures have not been sent in for a long time.

732
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,160
Okay, as soon as possible.

733
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Watch your feet.

734
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
It's not easy to walk here.

735
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,160
It's hard for you to come with me in the morning.

736
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
You don't have to be polite with me.

737
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,160
This morning, our manager said that there was an SID colleague coming to investigate.

738
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
I took the initiative to come here.

739
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,160
Du Zu is my old manager.

740
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,160
His people came to my first case.

741
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,160
I must cooperate with them all.

742
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,160
Then I'll trouble you, brother.

743
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
Don't be afraid.

744
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,160
Has Lao Meizha been back these years?

745
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,160
I don't think so.

746
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
I probably asked before you came.

747
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
I heard that he didn't even come back from his house.

748
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
Does he have other relatives in Taiwan?

749
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
There is also a twin brother named Lin Ming.

750
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
Here it is.

751
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,160
Right here.

752
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,160
Who is it?

753
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Hello, Lin Ming, right?

754
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
Your brother Lin Tao is an important witness in our case.

755
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,160
We want to find out about Lin Tao's situation.

756
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Captain Luo, the woman you asked me to investigate just now.

757
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
I found out that this person has a case.

758
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Zou Feng, a 42-year-old woman.

759
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
Her husband went out to buy groceries 20 years ago.

760
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,160
He had a fight with someone.

761
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
The other person suddenly took out a watermelon knife.

762
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
He stabbed his chest and abdomen.

763
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
After he was sent to the hospital, this person was not saved.

764
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
The police confirmed that this murderer had mental illness.

765
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
His family said that they didn't keep an eye on him and let him run out.

766
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Later, it was said that this murderer was locked in the安定 hospital.

767
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,160
It is said that?

768
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
The record of this case is not very complete.

769
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
A part of it seems to have been sealed.

770
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,160
Only the level of the Du family can be investigated.

771
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
What is the reason?

772
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,160
Because this is the first case that Lin Du has researched.

773
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,160
The murderer is not the murderer.

774
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,160
