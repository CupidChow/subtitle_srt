00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Episode 28

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,640
If

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,080
I kill myself,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,800
what will I be left?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For success, maybe I will do more unfair things.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This martial art represents the last struggle of Yu Lian's heart.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Dear audience, you have just heard the famous musical performance of Yue Du.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The winner is the cleaners. Thank you for listening.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
After hearing it in the taxi, I went back to check it.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I found that the app of Qiming Yue Du has been turned into a special listening app.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's very popular.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Except for the cleaners, there are almost no other people who applied.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Did you check the time of the cleaners updating the list?

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
On the day of He Zong Yi's death.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wei Zhou, do you think this is a coincidence?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We must always remember who I eat with.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This question is the essence of the character and the whole story.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you remember the label Zhou Hong Chuan gave to Pei Su?

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Whether it's a coincidence or not, I always think this case is not over.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who sent a message to He Zong Yi?

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why did Chen Zhen suddenly break into Hong Fu and take the coffin to find his own death?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And how did the fake reception table evaporate in the mortal world?

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All these things cannot be simply explained.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There must be a bigger conspiracy behind it.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait for us to investigate to the end.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Master, go to No. 13.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The murder of the 503 express delivery case is suspected of being a trap.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The crime of drug trafficking and protection in the West West District is also suspected of being a threat to the local community.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The rapid investigation of this case is like a strong blow to the public.

31
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Teacher.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Due to the change in the attitude of the special investigation team in the West West District,

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the frequency of the genetic test bill has also dropped to the lowest point in the last six months.

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The case is over.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The case is over.

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The case is over.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Go.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Luo Bing.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How stupid do you think they are?

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They still believe in them.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you think

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the ignorant people are more worth being cleared than those monsters who are born with genetic defects?

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,400
Yes

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,160
But it's a pity

45
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,720
Chen Zhen...

46
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,800
Chen Zhen

47
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,080
sacrificed himself for all of us

48
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,040
Mo Bing

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,120
Don't worry

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,000
I believe someone else will marry us

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
Don't you think so?

52
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Miao Xiaowei

53
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Go

54
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,600
You OK?

55
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,920
I just skip by

56
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,020
You guys talk first

57
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,880
I go to work

58
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
I shall go

59
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,380
So you put the flowers

60
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,420
You put the flowers

61
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,920
Be gentle.

62
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
I'll come back sometimes.

63
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
This is the first case I handled.

64
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
So it's impressive?

65
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
But it's not impressive to your mother.

66
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
What kind of body did you fall into?

67
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Of course, it's because of your persistence.

68
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
I remember the weather was not good that day.

69
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
At the point of the patrol,

70
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
there were only me and Tao Zi, two newbies.

71
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
We were shocked when we received your call.

72
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
We called to ask for help,

73
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
and tried our best to go to your house.

74
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
We were afraid that we would be together to murder and kill.

75
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
So we went to your house.

76
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
We were afraid that we would be together to kill and kill.

77
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
We were afraid that we would be together to murder and kill.

78
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
The murderer didn't go far,

79
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
and you wouldn't leave.

80
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Where was a child?

81
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
What kind of danger did you encounter?

82
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
When you arrived,

83
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
you were standing in your living room.

84
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
You didn't move.

85
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
You were looking at your mother.

86
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
I will never forget your eyes at that time.

87
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
You reminded me of you.

88
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
My master once mentioned a case.

89
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
It was many years ago.

90
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
When he mentioned it,

91
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
he was still thinking about it.

92
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
It was a case of missing girls.

93
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Several young girls were lost before and after.

94
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
They were released from school.

95
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Those who were supposed to go home didn't go home.

96
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
They just disappeared without knowing the truth.

97
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
One of the victims' father

98
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
couldn't stand this stimulation.

99
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
He went to several institutions

100
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
and ran hundreds of times.

101
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
He never made it through the case.

102
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
My master saw him playing with life

103
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
and persuaded him.

104
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
He must have known

105
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
that no one would persuade him about this.

106
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
My master once described

107
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
his eyes at that time.

108
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
He said that the father's eyes

109
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
were like a body that couldn't be seen.

110
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
He said that

111
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
the father's eyes were like a body that couldn't be seen.

112
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
But if you look at it again,

113
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
you can see

114
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
the light in the body.

115
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
That light

116
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
is not working.

117
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
When my master told me this,

118
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
you were the first one I thought of.

119
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Out of rebuild

120
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Thanks for helping me.

121
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
My master told me

122
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
if someone looked at you

123
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,240
Don't let your expectation down.

124
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
You!

125
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,640
Help me!

126
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,920
Calm down!

127
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,480
Go ahead.

128
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Aren't you my friend?

129
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,840
No.

130
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,760
Just for a reason.

131
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,400
I made you uncomfortable.

132
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
performing butt kiss, right?

133
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,600
Absolutely.

134
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,240
According to Escape's new place plan,

135
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,320
the rather this week,

136
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,540
both sides move together.

137
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,080
Hey, I hear from the senior.

138
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Are you going?

139
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,120
Thrash.

140
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,840
manure

141
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,520
plants

142
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,940
Thethree several month

143
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,920
The

144
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,420
The

145
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,220
Tao Fu, you bought this painting so beautifully.

146
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,060
And this bird cage is also nice.

147
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,180
On this wall,

148
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,700
we should put a baroque clock.

149
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
It can show the time.

150
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,300
It looks very special.

151
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,380
But I think we can put some

152
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,420
plant-based balls on the floor.

153
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,580
Otherwise, it looks a bit empty.

154
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,460
Yanjia, what do you think?

155
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,980
I...

156
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,380
My name is Qiao Han Yang.

157
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,260
Okay, okay.

158
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,540
Remember.

159
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,500
Since you are in the special team,

160
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,860
you can be like Xiaowu.

161
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,620
Call me Senior Sister.

162
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,660
I'll treat you.

163
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,380
Xiaowu is older than you.

164
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,580
Han Yang, leave her alone.

165
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,820
Tao Fu, don't be biased.

166
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,860
You can't take care of her

167
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,020
because she's new here.

168
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,980
Little Su,

169
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,540
you have the time to bully the newbies here.

170
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,340
Why don't you go to the kitchen

171
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,100
and help your boss?

172
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,020
Go back.

173
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh my god.

174
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
Boss, you can cook.

175
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,620
It's a Chinese dish.

176
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,100
I'll let you try my cooking.

177
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,900
Tao Zi hasn't eaten for a long time.

178
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,980
Okay, go out.

179
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,940
Don't help Dao Meng.

180
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,020
Come on.

181
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,660
You don't have any rules.

182
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,740
He seduced me first.

183
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,620
I haven't eaten Chinese food for a long time.

184
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,780
Boss, you're so good at cooking.

185
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,380
Why do you always go to the canteen?

186
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,260
Otherwise, I'll cook a big meal at home

187
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,100
and eat with the cat.

188
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,020
I'm sick.

189
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,460
When will Pei Su arrive?

190
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,900
Pei Su?

191
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,220
Will Pei Su come?

192
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
Why are you asking him?

193
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,980
Nothing.

194
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,980
I met Zhu when I was reporting.

195
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,100
He asked me to bring this to him.

196
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,980
A man who is brave and brave,

197
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,300
a man who is a man of heart.

198
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,860
A man who is brave and brave,

199
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,060
a man of heart.

200
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,940
Hello?

201
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,140
Brother,

202
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,620
how many floors do you live in?

203
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,540
Twelve.

204
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,460
By the way,

205
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,420
the elevator is broken.

206
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,980
Thank you for walking for a while.

207
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,260
You didn't take anything, right?

208
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,860
See you later.

209
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,980
Hello, which floor are you going?

210
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,060
Do you need help?

211
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,340
Hello, which floor are you going?

212
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,540
Do you need help?

213
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,420
Excuse me.

214
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,300
Are you late?

215
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,820
No.

216
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,020
You should have climbed up in five minutes.

217
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,940
Why haven't you climbed up yet?

218
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,740
Maybe I'm still trying to be brave.

219
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Another floor is broken.

220
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,220
Do you have rock candy?

221
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,140
No.

222
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,580
I'm going downstairs to check on Pei Su.

223
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,420
I'll bring a pack of it.

224
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,260
What do you want?

225
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,060
You need to know the answer when you go upstairs.

226
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,620
You're really a young master.

227
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,500
What are you doing?

228
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,460
Buy rock candy.

229
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
You don't know what I want.

230
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,100
What are you looking at?

231
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,580
I found that you seem to have

232
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,660
got along with Pei recently.

233
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,500
Those are the things I know.

234
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,180
But I didn't fall for that bastard anymore.

235
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,020
Go away.

236
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,940
They've all gone.

237
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,380
Then shall we...?

238
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,100
I don't think so.

239
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,260
But I guess it will be fixed soon

240
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,260
It's okay, I'm not in a hurry

241
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,860
Besides, I can't live without you

242
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,260
I said, Mr. Pei

243
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,820
Your legs are for going out

244
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,020
It's so tiring to climb stairs

245
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,820
Delicious

246
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,620
Tao...Tang Anni

247
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,660
Taozi

248
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,340
Why are you here

249
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,380
I just moved here

250
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,980
I will live here in the future

251
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,860
Why are you...

252
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,900
I live here

253
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,500
We are so fated

254
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,180
By the way, I'm sorry

255
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,700
I was just a little careless

256
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,420
I'm sorry

257
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
You have a job, I can understand

258
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,860
Brother, I need your handkerchief

259
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,460
Ok

260
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,060
You are going out

261
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,220
You

262
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,940
You go my place today

263
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,740
Ok

264
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,500
on the 17th floor.

265
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,940
Let's go.

266
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,940
It's not easy to raise a pig.

267
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm in a complicated mood.

268
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,780
You young people.

269
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,380
Why are you so quiet?

270
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,580
Coffee.

271
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,380
Come on.

272
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,780
Cheers.

273
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,180
Thank you, everyone.

274
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,860
Thank you, everyone.

275
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,620
Eat.

276
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,300
Eat.

277
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,780
Eat.

278
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,420
Sister Cang Jun.

279
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,500
You and Tao Fu were in the same high school.

280
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,220
And you met each other on a blind date.

281
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,460
Isn't that so fated?

282
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:54,940
Are you serious?

283
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,380
It was meant to be like this.

284
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,100
Is Tao Fu

285
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
always so heels in the export industry?

286
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,060
Yes,

287
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,700
but he worked so hard at the time.

288
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,780
Turned out his further education was additional degrees.

289
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,740
Although his skills

290
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,180
are less than five years,

291
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,520
his assembled ability is horas.

292
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,580
He is obsessed with WHGA.

293
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,580
He loves well-known meals

294
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,900
and small animals.

295
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,100
Besides,

296
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,620
for so many years,

297
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,380
in order to protect our impersonators,

298
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,260
he assists Ma Long

299
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,660
I've let go of the struggle of the hard-working table tennis players.

300
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,940
It's all because of Tao Fu.

301
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,380
He's the one who's been working hard.

302
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,940
I'm so glad to remember you for him.

303
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,620
Brother Tao is very patient.

304
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,860
Tao Fu is quite good.

305
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,100
Good.

306
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,340
If he has his own child in the future,

307
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,060
he will definitely be a good father.

308
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,780
I've been bothering him a lot when I was a kid.

309
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,620
My mother died young.

310
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,740
My father didn't care about me much.

311
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,940
He took good care of me.

312
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Actually, I was over ten at that time.

313
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,180
I was hungry even if no one cared about me.

314
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,980
But I was with him

315
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,060
until I knew what serious life is.

316
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,300
Sister,

317
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,700
don't think that he treats others like this

318
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,540
in his daily life.

319
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,140
But if he really takes care of his family,

320
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,740
he can think of anything.

321
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,980
You all praise him so much.

322
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,700
It seems that Tao Fu's staff is really good.

323
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,500
Yes.

324
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,620
No, really.

325
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,140
I didn't take care of Pei Su alone.

326
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,740
Everyone cares about you.

327
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,700
Even my master heard it later

328
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,020
and asked him a few times.

329
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,580
And that person, Lao Luo.

330
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,300
Don't think that he doesn't talk usually.

331
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,020
He cares about you a lot.

332
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,620
And that game console of yours.

333
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,420
Or he...

334
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,740
No.

335
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,340
Really?

336
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,220
My boss has done this kind of thing before.

337
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,780
What's wrong?

338
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,300
Nothing.

339
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,980
It's okay. I accidentally slipped.

340
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,580
It's okay.

341
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,700
It's okay. Eat.

342
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,940
Eat something.

343
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,340
taste

344
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,260
Lao Luo.

345
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,940
Lao Luo.

346
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,420
His laptop

347
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,740
is actually with you?

348
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,740
These are all cases that I was went gracias.

349
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,260
Mrs.ova says

350
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,980
these are all wishes won by Lao Yang.

351
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
He gave me everything after he died.

352
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,100
Captain Luo and his team have a mentor.

353
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,300
Why didn't I hear about it?

354
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,700
Call me Senior Sister.

355
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Senior Sister.

356
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,700
Old Yang was the captain when they transferred to the 6th Division.

357
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
They've always been close.

358
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,100
He was killed by a wanted criminal before retirement.

359
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
What?

360
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,100
I forgot to pay the electricity bill. I'll go get it.

361
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Brother Tao.

362
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,100
I'll go.

363
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,700
Brother, it's too stuffy in the room.

364
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,900
Can I go outside with you?

365
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Go.

366
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
Okay. Be careful.

367
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,500
Let's go.

368
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,700
Boss, who is this?

369
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,100
It's Lian Huashan, right?

370
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,700
I didn't find the missing six girls.

371
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,900
I've been thinking about Lian Huashan for half my life.

372
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,900
I couldn't forget it before retirement.

373
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Lian Huashan

374
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,900
It's about time. Let's go upstairs.

375
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,100
No.

376
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,700
You just treated me to a puff.

377
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,500
Why don't I invite you back?

378
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,700
I want to eat a matcha one.

379
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,500
At least, let me finish this puff.

380
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,500
Was this the missing girl?

381
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,900
She was the victim of the first intervention of the special investigation team.

382
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,500
Special investigation team?

383
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,700
Wasn't the missing girls always in charge of the special investigation team?

384
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,100
Not before.

385
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,900
It was because of these cases.

386
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,300
The propaganda that was caused by the case

387
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,300
eventually became a popular demand among the citizens.

388
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,100
After this incident, the government adopted a suggestion.

389
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,700
They included the special investigation team's scope when Wei Cheng Nian left.

390
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,700
They also set up an emergency start-up system.

391
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,100
It's what you all know. Failing alert.

392
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,300
Failing alert?

393
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,500
Guo Feiling?

394
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,700
Feiling is him?

395
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,100
That's right. It was for this year.

396
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,700
At that time,

397
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,100
Lao Yang was still in the inspection team.

398
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,900
I'm sorry.

399
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,900
One day, I received a report from my father.

400
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,900
He said that he lost his child.

401
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,900
And this girl's father, Guo Shi Nan,

402
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,100
received a call from the telephone booth.

403
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,900
This call was answered for a long time, but no one answered.

404
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
What crime is this?

405
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,100
You didn't tell me about the kid and you even called to torture their parents.

406
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,700
It's hard to imagine how sad their parents must have been.

407
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,700
What happened later? Did the murderer get caught?

408
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,500
Later, Guo Feiling's case was solved.

409
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,700
All clues were broken. Lao Yang felt suspicious.

410
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,100
He informed the inspection team that the Beidong Police Department had intervened.

411
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,300
He then discovered the whole Xinzhou city, including the nearby district.

412
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,100
A similar case of missing girls actually happened.

413
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,100
She was caught with the same criminal method.

414
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Shen state, sheng state, you're investigating a crime case.

415
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,700
Please tell me how you fell into the novelty.

416
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,500
I wasn't involved in the case but I thus was recovered.

417
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
We thought about this on the next morning.

418
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,700
I would like to thank you for saving my life.

419
00:31:33,700 --> 00:32:00,660
Big brother?

420
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,100
If they are not here,

421
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,500
my sister will take me to the subway.

422
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,060
If my sister works overtime,

423
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,700
I will stay in the school for a while.

424
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,500
Have you seen any suspicious people

425
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,340
nearby?

426
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,580
Or...

427
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,460
Suspicious old people?

428
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,620
Brother,

429
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,180
are you really driving?

430
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,700
What are you looking at?

431
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,900
Nothing.

432
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,580
I just found

433
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,340
a very suspicious person.

434
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,860
Chen Zhen,

435
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,380
when you are alone outside,

436
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,140
you should stay away from strangers.

437
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
I know.

438
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,580
I am not a child.

439
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,900
I am already 14 years old.

440
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,780
I should keep a distance from strangers.

441
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,460
I should not eat the food given by strangers.

442
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,260
Listen carefully.

443
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,700
People who are not strangers should be more careful.

444
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,140
Do not get into the car of an adult alone.

445
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,300
Do not stay in a place

446
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,660
where there is no one else.

447
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,460
For example,

448
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,020
it is very unsafe

449
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,300
for you to stay with me now.

450
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,180
What if I am a bad person?

451
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,300
I am just giving you an example.

452
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,580
Do I look like a bad person?

453
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,820
Brother,

454
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,140
I am a little scared when you say that.

455
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,660
It is good to be scared.

456
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,460
Boss,

457
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,780
you just said

458
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,580
that there is no interaction between these lost children.

459
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,740
What is the common point?

460
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,540
Are you done dressing up?

461
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,140
What is the matter?

462
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,540
It is okay.

463
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,100
Let's eat.

464
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,780
Let's eat.

465
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,540
Brother Tao.

466
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,500
Brother Tao.

467
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:01,940
Brother Tao.

468
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,600
In the

469
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,740
hidden case,

470
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,060
Wu Guangchang is the suspect

471
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,180
who was killed by the victim's father.

472
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,460
Why do you care about this?

473
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,820
It says

474
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,580
that these girls

475
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,620
have a common feature

476
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,740
besides their age.

477
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,060
It is a flower dress.

478
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,740
Are you going to die?

479
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,180
When Chenchen and I went out,

480
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,340
you were talking about this case.

481
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,100
After we came back,

482
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,700
Lan Qiao asked what the common point was.

483
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,420
You looked at Chenchen.

484
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,700
She is the same as the girls on it.

485
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,380
They are all wearing flower dress.

486
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,860
But you didn't say anything at that time.

487
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,180
You can teach children to be careful

488
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
in preventing strangers.

489
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,180
And you can improve their alertness.

490
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,020
But you can't let them

491
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,300
be afraid to wear a flower dress.

492
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,140
It is not the victim's fault

493
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,900
to meet the murderer.

494
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
Otherwise, what's the use of us?

495
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,460
Brother Luo is right.

496
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,620
So,

497
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,220
you can teach them

498
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,220
to be careful.

499
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,180
But you can't let them

500
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,340
be afraid to wear a flower dress.

501
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,700
I don't think

502
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,780
the game console

503
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,420
was given to me by Tao Zai Luo.

504
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,300
What are you doing?

505
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,100
I'm busy.

506
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,060
What are you busy with?

507
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,100
That boy is here again.

508
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,980
Wei Zhao, you should know

509
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,380
that it's hard for his mother

510
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,420
to be killed.

511
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,460
Give me some more time.

512
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,660
If this is the end,

513
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,940
I will tell him personally.

514
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,300
But can he accept it?

515
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,420
Sometimes,

516
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,540
I want to wait for

517
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,780
an impossible result.

518
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,700
It's better not to

519
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,540
give him this chance at the beginning.

520
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,300
It's too late.

521
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,580
I have agreed with the child.

522
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,860
Let's not talk about this now.

523
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,180
The most urgent thing now is

524
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,020
to send this boy

525
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,420
back to school and go to school.

526
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,260
What are you doing here every day?

527
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,020
I scolded him yesterday.

528
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,740
You go today.

529
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,500
I...

530
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,220
Okay.

531
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
I'll go to get you out of here.

532
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,780
Wait a minute.

533
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,820
That boy

534
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,420
likes this kind of retro style.

535
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,140
I didn't drag him...

536
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,700
No.

537
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,620
I... I stole it from my friend

538
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,500
in the dark.

539
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,140
Take it back.

540
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,340
Okay.

541
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,180
What's wrong again?

542
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Don't say I took it back.

543
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,980
I got it.

544
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,540
I found that

545
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,300
Dongbin,

546
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,300
who has been bitten by you for so many years,

547
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,140
is a good person.

548
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,620
You are not at ease now?

549
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,660
You didn't eat much just now

550
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,900
and drank a lot of wine.

551
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,540
Don't drink this.

552
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,580
Most importantly,

553
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,700
it has been hard on you.

554
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,340
Do you want some soda?

555
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,740
Thank you very much

556
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,580
for your concern, uncle.

557
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,580
I'm afraid I can't see your master's handwriting.

558
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
I'm afraid I can't see the words you said in the cemetery.

559
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
I'm afraid I can't see the victim, Guo Feilin's father,

560
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,580
start to investigate by himself,

561
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
claiming that he found the suspect,

562
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,580
and stabbed him to death with a watermelon knife.

563
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
I'm afraid I can't see the words you said in the cemetery.

564
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
I'm afraid I can't see the victim, Guo Feilin's father,

565
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
and stabbed him to death with a watermelon knife.

566
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Don't worry.

567
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,580
This case is not for me.

568
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I won't stab anyone.

569
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
It's my style to kill people with a knife.

570
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
But I'm not the kind of person

571
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
who would kill people with a knife at any time

572
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,380
and kill his father's

573
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
to be in this state.

574
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
It's rare to have no obstacle.

575
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
I really want to thank team Luo

576
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,580
for taking care of me all the time.

577
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
I'm leaving.

578
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Help me tell Tao Zi.

579
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I'm leaving.

580
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
The rest of the dishes are in the refrigerator.

581
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Heat them yourself.

582
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,580
If you have time tonight,

583
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
remember to bring some gifts to the 1701 upstairs.

584
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
That's Tang Ning's house.

585
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
Thank her and Chen Chen for being our guests.

586
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Let your single-handedly friend

587
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
to be the guest.

588
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,580
I'm leaving.

589
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,580
I'm leaving.

590
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,580
I'm leaving.

591
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,580
I'm leaving.

592
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Definitely.

593
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,580
I'm going.

594
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,580
Thank you.

595
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,380
There's a person, probably an old man.

596
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,540
He seems to be following her.

597
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,460
Please be careful, parents.

598
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,220
Protect the child.

599
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,260
So,

600
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,340
the current level of technology

601
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
can make the correct rate of genetic testing

602
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,020
to more than 99%.

603
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,140
We've been doing genetic testing with SID.

604
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,980
There's almost no mistake.

605
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,100
Almost?

606
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,700
One percent

607
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,220
is probably a genius.

608
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,660
So you think genetic abnormality

609
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,660
won't lead to crime 100%?

610
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,300
The cause of crime is very complicated.

611
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,060
The environment, family, and education

612
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,660
may affect one's thinking and behavior.

613
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,980
Master.

614
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,740
Master.

615
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,820
It's a pulse.

616
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Pulse 88.6.

617
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,700
Twelve point five.

618
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,700
Eighty-eight.

619
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Eighty-eight.

620
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Eighty-eight.

621
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
Eighty-eight.

622
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,700
Eighty-eight.

623
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,580
Eighty-eight.

624
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,820
Dear audience,

625
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,980
this is Tiaopin FM 88.6.

626
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,260
Now we have

627
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,620
a mass award from The famous music accident,

628
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:30,600
the award for Dog Conf

629
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,760
I'm afraid I can't be alone

630
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,560
I'm afraid I can't be alone

631
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,560
I'm afraid I can't be alone

632
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,560
I'm afraid I can't be alone

I'm afraid I can't be alone

640
