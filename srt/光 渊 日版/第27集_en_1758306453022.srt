1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
Mr. Lu, I think you are under suspicion.

2
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,840
Just a curfew.

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,160
Is there anythingjuicier?

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,120
Look at this.

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,720
This is a suppressor at the killer's.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,700
This is De manages a 2-year share at the mall.

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,080
,

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,120
Here.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,740
A note of

10
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,180
It's the gold bar found in Uncle Huo's house.

11
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,740
The arrangement is exactly the same.

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,180
And it's worth 500,000 yuan.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,100
It's a ritual.

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,980
He's really crazy.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,260
And I asked Lan Qiao, the killer,

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,540
to tell me that when he found the gold bar,

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,980
it was like this.

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,580
So I think the Zhang family was probably framed.

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,500
Just like how he framed Uncle Huo back then.

20
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,220
Have you ever thought

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,220
why it's been ten years

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,620
since those people arranged the same thing

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
to frame Zhang Zu?

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,740
Zhang Zu must be framed

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,980
for killing the refugees.

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,100
But maybe it's not Huo Xiao'an.

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,580
We can't listen to him.

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,300
He's innocent.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,460
We need to find evidence to prove it.

30
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,540
Why do you keep calling to inform me?

31
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,300
Theicks in her heart are short.

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,260
In less than a few days,

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,860
they'll be attracted to you by other news.

34
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,420
But you know,

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,620
no matter what happens outside,

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,340
we just need to make theiniens offord us ourselves.

37
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,700
Overï¿½uu has just met.

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,740
He's cleared out of suspicion.

39
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,460
But there is one question.

40
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
If the news is not leaked by Kong Wei City,

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
who will it be?

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
Sister Tang Lin.

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Really?

44
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
That's great.

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,580
I'll be there right away.

46
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
I'll be there right away.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
What's wrong?

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
He's about to wake up.

49
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
I didn't keep a close eye on the order you left.

50
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
It's only been less than a year.

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
And so many things have happened.

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Old Du.

53
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,460
It wasn't me at first.

54
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,460
I know it wasn't you.

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
We've known each other for so many years.

56
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,460
We know each other's roots.

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,460
They said I took 500,000 to buy the chain.

58
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,460
I didn't know what to do with it.

59
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,460
I didn't know what to do with it.

60
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
I didn't know what to do with it.

61
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,460
I didn't know what to do with it.

62
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,460
You took 500,000 to buy Lin Ming's life.

63
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,460
The fire was also 500,000.

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,460
Old Du, think about it.

65
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
Who's framing me?

66
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Who's framing me with such a big effort?

67
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
You mean...

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,460
I'm here today to cooperate with the investigation.

69
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,460
They've checked my work arrangement for the past few years.

70
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,460
One of them asked me

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,460
why I was going to start a second 0-degree plan.

72
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
I was stunned.

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
I asked them what 0-degree plan was.

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,460
They showed me the report they sent me.

75
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Old Du.

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,460
I just promised Old Pan and the special investigation team

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
to do a psychological investigation project together.

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
I only mentioned these in the report.

79
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,460
I've never given this project a bad name.

80
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,460
I never said it.

81
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
0-degree plan.

82
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
But when I accepted it,

83
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
the project was approved.

84
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,460
The name is 0-degree plan.

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,460
If it wasn't you,

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,460
if it wasn't me,

87
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,460
it would only be the Xinzhou police.

88
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
I'll go find Old Pan.

89
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
You should ask Old Pan

90
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
who's framing me.

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,460
Who's going to bring this ghost back?

92
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Or...

93
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Old Du.

94
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Is he really dead?

95
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,460
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,460
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,460
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,460
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,460
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,460
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,460
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,460
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,460
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,460
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,460
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,460
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,460
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,460
Sorry.

142
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,460
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
Here, yourAHNED.

144
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
It's a little hard for me to make friends

145
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,460
What's wrong?

146
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
You still don't want to?

147
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Tanning

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
I...

149
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Tang Sheng

150
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
You're finally awake

151
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
Xiao Wu is here

152
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Xiao Wu

153
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Xiao Wu, give me the stuff

154
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
Thank you, sister-in-law

155
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Xiao Wu

156
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Why are you taking so many things?

157
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Wife and child are waiting for you to raise

158
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
Take everything back

159
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,460
Old Fu

160
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Let me be quiet

161
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,460
If you didn't drive for me that day

162
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
I'm sorry

163
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,460
This child

164
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Why is he so serious?

165
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Besides, if you want to say sorry, I should say it

166
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
I was not considerate that day

167
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Driving you to such a dangerous place

168
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Tang Fu, don't say that

169
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Protecting the people is not your task

170
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Then this matter is over

171
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
If there is anything that can be done in the future

172
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm really angry

173
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
Enough

174
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
What adults still have a bitter nose

175
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,460
Almost a father

176
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Drink some water first

177
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Thank you, sister-in-law

178
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
Sister-in-law is really virtuous

179
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Sister-in-law

180
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
My bag is dirty

181
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
No need to drink

182
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
Nothing

183
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,460
Sorry, I dropped your pants

184
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
I'll sew it for you later

185
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
It's okay, it's okay

186
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
Where did you go?

187
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
It's okay, I'll find it

188
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Yes, this

189
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Give it to me

190
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
I'll go out and take a breath

191
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,460
What's wrong?

192
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
I'll go out and take a breath

193
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
It's me

194
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
It's me

195
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
I

196
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
When we caught Li Ming

197
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,460
I took this bag

198
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,460
It's my brother's life

199
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,460
How can I be stupid?

200
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
How can I be stupid?

201
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,460
I'm not stupid

202
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm not stupid

203
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
I'm not stupid

204
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
I'm not stupid

205
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
I'm not stupid

206
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
I'm not stupid

207
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
Calm down

208
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
It's not the time to cry

209
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,460
Think about it

210
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Where have you been all this time?

211
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
Who have you seen?

212
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
I haven't been anywhere

213
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Except

214
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Home

215
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
In the tribe

216
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
The three-point line of the hospital

217
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
Except

218
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
By the way, Yanjing

219
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,460
I heard from Xiao Jiao before

220
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
It's because you came back in time

221
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,460
So I blocked that Nanhu Palace

222
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
How did you find it wrong?

223
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
It's because of that rumor

224
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
Rumor of Lin Ming waking up

225
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
Who told you?

226
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,460
Nothing

227
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
But it's a coincidence

228
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
I just came down and met Yang Xi

229
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,460
He casually mentioned it to me

230
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
Said he heard someone talking in the canteen

231
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
I felt wrong when I heard it

232
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
So that murderer didn't lie

233
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Someone deliberately spread the news of Lin Ming waking up

234
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
And seduced him

235
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Judging from the final result

236
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,460
Maybe it's not just the murderer

237
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
And SID

238
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,460
What is SID seducing?

239
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
Are you talking about me?

240
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Hello, Taozi

241
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
Chief

242
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
Xiao Wu found a sensor in the bag

243
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,460
It's Yang Xifang's

244
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Go back

245
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,460
Go back

246
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
Go back

247
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Thank you

248
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,460
You

249
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,460
You

250
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
You

251
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
Xiao Wu went to catch Lin Ming

252
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Except for home and the forest

253
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
The only place I've been is

254
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,460
The sick room of Mrs. Wu

255
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,460
And the receiver I broke

256
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,460
Before that

257
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
I also went to Mrs. Wu's house

258
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
Lost the medical book of that old man

259
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:38,940
Is

260
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,460
It's not me

261
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,460
It's...

262
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
Yang Xi

263
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,460
Yang Xi

264
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Yang Xi

265
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
You finally came to see me

266
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
Yang Xi

267
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,460
I heard about your illness last month

268
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,460
I wanted to come here in person

269
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm afraid you won't be happy to see me

270
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
It's delayed until now

271
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
You blame us for Yang Xi

272
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
I know

273
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I can blame you for what?

274
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm a dying person

275
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
Just say what you want

276
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,460
I don't have much time to hear

277
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Sister-in-law

278
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,460
I just want to ask you one thing

279
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,460
The person who proposed the second 0 degree plan

280
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
Is it you?

281
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
When Yang was alive

282
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
He mentioned you to us

283
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
He said you were bold and hardworking

284
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,460
You didn't dare to do it

285
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
We even laughed at him saying that his wife was a fan

286
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
But now

287
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
I believe it

288
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
Xi Xi is still a child

289
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,460
He doesn't know anything

290
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
You sent him to Lao Pan

291
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,460
You told him to push Lao Pan to start the second 0 degree plan

292
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,460
And the internship of the special investigation team

293
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
And the secret of Xie Mi

294
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Sister-in-law

295
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
You put the child's future on the line

296
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Why?

297
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
It's not me

298
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,460
I thought about it

299
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
But I didn't do it

300
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
They

301
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
Take care of me

302
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Ask me if I want to help them

303
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,460
I wanted to promise them

304
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
But

305
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Just the day before I met them

306
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,460
I actually

307
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,460
I met our Lao Yang

308
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,460
We never met in our whole life

309
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
He didn't say a word to me

310
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
But that time

311
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,460
In the dream

312
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,460
He said to me so strictly

313
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
You

314
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
You

315
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,460
The wife of SID Tan Yuan

316
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
Never

317
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
For the sake of our own interests

318
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Do such a thing

319
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Forget it

320
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
From that day

321
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I just persuade myself

322
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
All the grievances

323
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Just forget it

324
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I can't

325
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
Give my husband

326
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,460
SID's identity

327
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
To be tainted black

328
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Sister-in-law

329
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
It's me

330
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
I didn't take good care of you

331
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Old Du

332
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
My daughter Xin Xin

333
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
She is still a child

334
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Have you heard that?

335
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Bad guys

336
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Are all good people

337
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
This child is thoughtful

338
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
He saw his father's medical book

339
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
He suspected his father's death

340
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Another secret

341
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
I just found out a few days ago

342
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
They actually found Xin Xin

343
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
Who are they?

344
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
They

345
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
They are

346
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Promote the genetic detection plan

347
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,460
To eliminate all the people who are in the same level of sensitivity

348
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,460
They are the ones who clear out these monster's genetic disease

349
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
They

350
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
They

351
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Sister-in-law

352
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Sister-in-law

353
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Sister-in-law

354
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
Sister-in-law

355
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Sorry, sir

356
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Please go out

357
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Please cooperate

358
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
Please cooperate

359
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
Please cooperate

360
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
To Xin Xin

361
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
To my daughter

362
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
To my daughter

363
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
The heart rate is at 5

364
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,460
The blood pressure is at 50

365
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,460
The body temperature is at 3

366
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,460
The temperature is at 25

367
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
Go find Yang Xi

368
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Let him come back to see his mother

369
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Yes, sir

370
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Captain Chu, over there

371
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
What are you doing?

372
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,460
Yang Xi, over there

373
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
Yang Xi

374
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
Stop

375
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Yang Xi

376
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
Stop

377
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Boss, get in the car

378
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Go after them

379
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
Go

380
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Over there

381
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Yes

382
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
They took the car to take Yang Xi away

383
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,460
Brother Wu drove a car and took the team to chase

384
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,460
Xiao Wu is just right

385
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
He is thinking about it

386
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,460
The case of Tian Sizhong and the case of Shen Yu Lao

387
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Lin Min's case

388
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Kong's case

389
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
It's all his responsibility

390
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
If he can take it this time

391
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
Chase the little sister back

392
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
He will feel better

393
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,460
It's Luo team

394
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Xiao Yang, help me check

395
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
The road network surveillance nearby

396
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
A red car

397
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Car number

398
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
NAY2F9

399
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Luo

400
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,460
I have his phone number

401
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,460
You go to the location

402
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
Since he ran away with them

403
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Such a big flaw

404
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Will he keep it?

405
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Let you try, just try

406
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Look, he is different from them

407
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
He was cheated

408
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
And his mother is still in there

409
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
He will not cut off the connection with his mother

410
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
The soul does not disperse

411
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Move away

412
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,460
They are positioning

413
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
Girl, you can't fight with them

414
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
Sister, I'm not

415
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
Sister, let me stay

416
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
The doctor in the hospital just now

417
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
He was beaten up

418
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
I'm afraid he will not recover

419
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,460
He can't take me

420
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
But it's not a matter of people

421
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
How long have the brothers and sisters been afraid

422
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
I don't know

423
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,460
Yang Xi

424
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
Yang Xi

425
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
The injustice of so many years

426
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,460
Will be washed away soon

427
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Who will save us

428
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Be careful

429
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Be careful

430
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
What should we do, boss?

431
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
Call

432
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
Captain Luo, I told you he is not trustworthy

433
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Su Su, can you shut up?

434
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
But I just saw them on the surveillance camera

435
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Although the road network is not complete

436
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
There are cameras in the alley

437
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
Give me the location, hurry

438
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Go

439
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,460
Go

440
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
Captain Luo

441
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,460
This is the last location of the surveillance camera

442
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
They came in five minutes ago

443
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Then they lost track

444
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Locate my phone

445
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Hurry up

446
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
Yes

447
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
Hurry up

448
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Xiao Wu

449
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Xiao Wu

450
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460

Xiao Wu

453
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Stop

454
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460

455
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460

Are you OK?

516
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
I'm very scared

517
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,860
I've been Awesome

518
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Why are you disêµ¬lloing herself?

519
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Xiao Wu

520
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,460

Xiao Wu

524
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
They've got a new student

525
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
Yang Xi!

526
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
Wu! Wu!

527
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Wu! Wu!

528
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
Be quiet!

529
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Speak! Where is Yang Xi?

530
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
Speak!

531
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
Listen!

532
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,460
We lost our loved ones, lost ourselves, lost our normal lives.

533
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,460
We were sad and in pain, and we grew up in the bitter sea of losing our loved ones.

534
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,460
At first, everyone was looking at you.

535
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,460
Everyone was looking at you, crying and saying you were poor.

536
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,460
But in a few days, no one will remember you.

537
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
Everyone's life is going on.

538
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Only you can stay in the same place.

539
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Do you hear me?

540
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Let me go!

541
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Be quiet!

542
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Did I say anything wrong?

543
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
Wu!

544
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Junior!

545
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
What are you doing?

546
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
What are you doing?

547
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
Shoot!

548
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,460
Junior!

549
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
Put the gun down!

550
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
What are you doing?

551
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,460
Junior!

552
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Put the gun down!

553
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
Yang Xi!

554
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
Don't you want to avenge your father?

555
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
Junior!

556
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
Stop it!

557
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,460
Put the gun down!

558
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Junior!

559
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Put the gun down!

560
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Calm down!

561
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
Yang Xi!

562
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,460
Do you think you can still go back?

563
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Do you think you can still go back to them?

564
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
Stop!

565
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Stop!

566
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,460
Stop!

567
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
Stop!

568
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Stop!

569
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Stop!

570
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
Stop!

571
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Stop!

572
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Stop!

573
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Stop!

574
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Stop!

575
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,460
Stop!

576
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Yang Xi!

577
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
Listen to me!

578
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Don't be fooled by her!

579
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
Yang Xi!

580
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
Yang Xi, did you see that?

581
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,460
That's how they treat us!

582
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
I want to avenge her!

583
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Shut up!

584
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Yang Xi!

585
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,460
Shoot!

586
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
What are you thinking?

587
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
Put the gun down!

588
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,460
Shoot!

589
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
How dare you be fooled by her!

590
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
Shoot!

591
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,460
Junior!

592
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
Junior!

593
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Your mother is waiting for you to come back!

594
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
I...

595
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
I...

596
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
I...

597
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Qing'er...

598
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Qing'er...

599
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Qing'er...

600
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Qing'er!

601
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
Why are you here today?

602
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460
Let me carry you.

603
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
Qing'er!

604
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,460
Qing'er!

605
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
Qing'er!

606
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
Qing'er!

607
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
Qing'er!

608
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Qing'er!

609
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Qing'er!

610
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
Qing'er!

611
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Qing'er!

612
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
Qing'er!

613
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,460
Qing'er!

614
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
Qing'er!

615
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
Qing'er!

616
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Qing'er!

617
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Qing'er!

618
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
Qing'er!

619
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Qing'er!

620
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Qing'er!

621
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Qing'er!

622
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
Qing'er!

623
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Qing'er!

624
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,460
Qing'er!

625
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
Qing'er!

626
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Qing'er!

627
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
Qing'er!

628
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,460
Qing'er!

629
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Qing'er!

630
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Qing'er!

631
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Qing'er!

632
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Qing'er!

633
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Qing'er!

634
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Qing'er!

635
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
Qing'er!

636
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Qing'er!

637
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,460
Qing'er!

638
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Qing'er!

639
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
Qing'er!

640
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,460
Qing'er!

641
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Qing'er!

642
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Qing'er!

643
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,460
Qing'er!

644
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Qing'er!

645
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
Qing'er!

646
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Qing'er!

647
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,460
Qing'er!

648
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Qing'er!

649
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
Qing'er!

650
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,460
Qing'er!

651
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
Qing'er!

652
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
Qing'er!

653
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
Qing'er!

654
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Qing'er!

655
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Qing'er!

656
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Qing'er!

657
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
Qing'er!

658
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,460
Qing'er!

659
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Qing'er!

660
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,460
Xiao Wu!

661
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
Xiao Wu.

662
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,460
Xiao Wu.

663
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
It's okay.

664
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,460
Boss.

665
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
It's okay.

666
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,460
The doctor will be here soon.

667
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Hang in there.

668
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,460
Hang in there.

669
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Hang in there.

670
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Don't give up.

671
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
You're going to wait for your dad.

672
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,460
He's waiting for you to go home.

673
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Did you hear that?

674
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Xiao Wu.

675
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Xiao Wu.

676
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,460
Xiao Wu.

677
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
Are you okay?

678
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,460
Xiao Wu.

679
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
Xiao Wu.

680
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Xiao Wu.

681
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Xiao Wu.

682
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
Xiao Wu.

683
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,460
Don't ÐÑÑÑ

684
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,180
I'm so worried about our little girl.

685
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:08,540
I promised to not

686
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,420
tell anybody.

687
00:43:41,420 --> 00:44:08,980
So oggi

688
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,740
That child came in and out just now.

689
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,300
Let's go.

690
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,500
Let's go.

691
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,460
Go and live at the top.

692
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,980
That's it!

693
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,260
Hello?

694
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,260
Captain Luo, why do you think this is?

695
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,260
Could it be that they are deliberately leaving us with them?

696
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Did the surveillance camera capture that woman's face?

697
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,260
It did. We also checked. Her name is Wang Nobin.

698
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,260
She is a victim of a fraud case.

699
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,260
Send me the photo.

700
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,260
Okay.

701
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,260
Hello, welcome.

702
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,260
Go and investigate this person. I want all of his information.

703
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,260
Yes.

704
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,260
Hello, the number you have dialed is now switched off.

705
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,260
Isn't the house price at the top not cheap?

706
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,260
I saw it when I was there.

707
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,260
That community, it's green like a park.

708
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,260
It's not convenient at all.

709
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
You can't get in by car.

710
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,260
When you get to your house,

711
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,260
you'll have to walk a few steps.

712
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,260
My house?

713
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,260
But I said I saw it when I was there.

714
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,260
Master, you can go back to the village.

715
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,260
It's not like seeing your clothes and dressing up like a person living there.

716
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,260
I've been thinking

717
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,260
of meeting the organization that I first come to.

718
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,260
But I never thought

719
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,260
they are more calm than I imagined.

720
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,260
In the end, they dare not to face me and only

721
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,260
act recklessly.

722
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,260
Now that they have been to the capital,

723
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,260
even the key person has been missing.

724
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,260
They dare not to show themselves.

725
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,260
Hello,

726
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,260
I'm the one who is responsible for the investigation.

727
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
I'm the one who is responsible for the investigation.

728
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,260
Okay.

729
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,260
A13.

730
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,260
Who are they?

731
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,260
We and Pei Shi are the closest partners.

732
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,260
Even if Old Pei is not here,

733
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
as long as you tell us,

734
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,260
it will never change.

735
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,260
The person behind you is really a great person.

736
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,260
Pei Zheng Yu already knows everything.

737
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,260
He still wants to fight with me.

738
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,260
Call him Master.

739
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,260
Okay.

740
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,260
Then may I ask

741
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,260
what is your opinion

742
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,260
about my former partner's son?

743
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,260
I also have a very good memory.

744
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,260
Mr. Pei,

745
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,260
we are here to talk about cooperation with you.

746
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,260
Also, I'm just a running man.

747
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,260
Even if you catch me and beat me,

748
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,260
you will not be able to ask something useful.

749
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,260
Moreover,

750
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,260
now you will only have to sit in my car.

751
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,260
Your people

752
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,260
will have their own memories, right?

753
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,100
Now,

754
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,900
we can say that there's no one else.

755
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,020
I have something to say to Mr. Pei.

756
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,780
He said you've met him.

757
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,340
But it's a pity that he can't come personally.

758
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,580
He can't?

759
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,020
The previous incident was so mysterious

760
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,420
because he was too cunning.

761
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,060
But he didn't show up.

762
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,860
There's no such thing as a thief.

763
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,940
The murderer who wrote the seal

764
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,420
will never be cleaned again.

765
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,300
He's already

766
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,660
in a bad situation.

767
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,420
There's a very important clue.

768
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,860
You should know it.

769
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,140
I should know it?

770
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,140
What?

771
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,380
The FD9101 flight from Xinzhou tonight

772
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,300
has your company's deputy.

773
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,780
You're willing to tell me such an important thing?

774
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,940
I'm really not afraid.

775
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,900
I'll take all the benefits.

776
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,140
You're right.

777
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,140
You're just like your father.

778
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,620
He's born to be cunning and greedy.

779
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,660
He's born to be a monster.

780
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,780
But don't worry, Mr. Pei.

781
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,860
Dongyue is not our strength.

782
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,900
You can accept

783
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,700
everything from the Guangyao Foundation.

784
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,660
We're not interested.

785
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,500
I just hope

786
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,740
Chen Yuan's old case will be solved.

787
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,300
The root of the crime should be cleared.

788
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,180
Let this world

789
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,180
be cleared as it was.

790
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,860
What a great deal.

791
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,180
Then please keep your promise.

792
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,860
Don't let your father

793
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,140
end up like that.

794
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,980
Tell your teacher

795
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,780
Living Living

796
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,660
a diversified life.

797
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,420
Happy dennise!

798
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,420
You didn't just train me?

799
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,060
Do I look bad now?

800
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,180
You have matured too much.

801
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,620
Why do you need training?

802
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,780
Your father came to Ø¨ brush me.

803
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,580
I don't want education.

804
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,700
Model T mandarins

805
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,500
I can't see the trace of the little characters in the picture.

806
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,100
Later, there was a man who was very famous.

807
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,220
Very famous?

808
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,580
He strongly supports this argument.

809
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,660
Although I don't know who this person is,

810
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,340
he must be one of the early promoters

811
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,660
of the genetic test.

812
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,860
Who is he?

813
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,340
Later, my master said

814
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,940
this person had died long ago.

815
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,460
Call him Teacher.

816
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,100
My teacher asked me to bring a message to Mr. Pei.

817
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,780
He said he had seen him before,

818
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,020
but it's a pity

819
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,660
that he can't come personally.

820
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,820
He can't.

821
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,140
My people

822
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,620
have already infiltrated the organization.

823
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,500
It depends on how you use it.

824
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,140
Before signing the contract,

825
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,300
you'd better get that thief out.

826
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,220
Mr. Pei.

827
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,340
Are you looking for me?
