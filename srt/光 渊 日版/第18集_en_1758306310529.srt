1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey, is this cat biting people?

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You live here now?

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's a lot different from your office

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not the same style

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

14
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm leaving

15
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Pei, your car is really good

16
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You really don't drive it anymore?

17
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Du Jia

18
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The people behind Su Cheng can't sit anymore

19
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Could it be them?

20
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They are so cautious

21
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We have been investigating for so many years

22
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They don't even know how to drive

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It seems that Zheng Kai Feng is really important to them

24
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Losing this big building

25
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Their days will definitely be hard

26
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's why they are so anxious

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To find new sources of money

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
To pull me

29
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It seems that my fame has been

30
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Overshadowed in the industry these years

31
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The way the company manages

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The way they pull out the ventilator in the nursing home

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And the way they throw away the company's management

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Finally, they have completed the whole story

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
To let someone recognize me as

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
A rich second generation who is not interested in the outside world

37
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If I didn't know you three years ago

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I would have believed it all these years

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, right

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The name of the song has been updated today

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This time it's the manipulator

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What is the case?

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know yet

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Last time, they produced a song through the dead

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know yet

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Last time, they produced a song through the dead

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Last time, they produced Zheng Kai Feng through the dead

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know yet

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's the rush this time?

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can they really endure the rush?

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For so long, except for the name of the song

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There is no new clue

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's not that bad

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do you mean?

55
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Did you find something?

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The mysterious person you told me to investigate

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Did you mention the information about that mysterious person

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To Captain Luo?

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I suggest you

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Have a good talk with him

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why?

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I just found a piece of information

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The person you are looking for

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He is

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yang Zheng Feng's old partner

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm back

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm back

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm back

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Grandma Shaxi's grandfather

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
His only relative

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
His parents died

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
His family had a grandfather

73
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He had a stroke two years ago

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He has a lot of sequelae

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He is smart, but he is not flexible

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No one understands what he says

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's hard for him to do it

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He has to take care of his grandfather

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And study hard

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
How is his study?

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Very good

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When I called, the teacher said his homework was the best

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He never let people worry about his study

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Very good

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He has a lot of choices

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why did he choose to go to this school?

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's far beyond the private school

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
A school like Yufeng

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Besides taking care of the rich

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It needs students like him

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
To make a living

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yufeng gives him 100,000 yuan a year

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
100,000 yuan

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A family like him is cheaper

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Enough to pay for their grandchildren

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
A good student

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Will he leave school because of emptiness and boredom?

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Captain Luo, the surveillance camera has caught the murderer

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's Du Guosheng

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Where are Feng Bin and Xia Xinnan?

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did the surveillance camera catch them?

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes, it did

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
After Du Guosheng appeared

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Feng Bin waited for 10 minutes at the east gate of Ye Langgu's police station

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Xia Xinnan came

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So this is the reason why they are separated from others?

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because they are a couple

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They are not a couple

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They are a couple

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They are not a couple

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They are a couple

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because they are a couple

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Louder

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What is Feng Bin holding?

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
A jade-like supermarket

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I remember it's a chain

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I have a question

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Ye Langgu has several chain stores

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think the students who ran away

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Should be around there

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We need to find them quickly

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why don't these two students

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go to a better place

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
To date

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why go to Ye Langgu?

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Boss, are you asking me?

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There is a small place behind Ye Langgu

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Called Jien Yuan Shi

133
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a natural stone

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The god of marriage stays in the world

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's for men and women

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Say it

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Men and women tie up the wish-making stone

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
To pray to the god of marriage

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Then the god of marriage can see the wishes of the two

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
To make their fate better

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't even get married

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
God has to be your witness

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Buy more rooms

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then?

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Have you recovered your behavior rules?

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Where are they going next?

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
According to Feng Bing's blood

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
A victim is suspected to have been attacked by Du Guosheng

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The first location is the outside surveillance of Ye Langgu

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The second location is the most famous spot in Ye Langgu

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Jien Yuan Shi

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
According to the blood on the scene

154
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Feng Bing and Xia Xinnan are here

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
For the first time, Du Guosheng was attacked

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Du Guosheng is also here, he cut Feng Bing's back

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Both sides had a fight

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They were supposed to come to Jien Yuan Shi

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
To make their fate better

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I didn't expect this to happen

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So Du Guosheng

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Is chasing them away

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's next?

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Next is another part of the surveillance

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
22.13, location 3

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Du Guosheng is chasing them away

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We also found Feng Bing's blood on the way

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Location 4, crime scene

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
According to the blood and footprints on the scene

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We roughly restored the route of action

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Feng Bing and Xia Xinnan ran into the house

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hiding next to the cabinet

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We also found the blood on the cabinet

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And on the trash can handle

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We also found the fingerprints of Feng Bing

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Where?

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Feng Bing and Xia Xinnan don't know why

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They suddenly left here

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They walked out of the door

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And ran into Du Guosheng

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Du Guosheng killed Feng Bing

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And destroyed Feng Bing's eyes

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Then he broke into Feng Bing's body

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And walked into the house

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And left a footprint

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why did Du Guosheng enter the house?

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't guess

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is it possible that the footprints were

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Before Feng Bing was killed

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Du Guosheng went in to find someone?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Impossible

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Although the footprints are not clear

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But there is only one line

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The purpose is clear

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And it won't happen

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is the incident

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We recovered with the witness team

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I think there is something wrong

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why are the two students in love

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So coincidental

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And meet a serial killer

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Who is inside

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Where is Feng Bing's phone?

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did you get the backup?

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Did he call for help?

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We found the SIM card of the phone

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And found out that Feng Bing bought it

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
After he ran away

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There is no other information

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Except 4pm, he sent a message to Xia Xinnan

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
At 10pm, the police didn't see him

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
At 22.34pm

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I called a police

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why didn't the police rescue him?

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because no one talked

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No one talked

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hello, this is the emergency exit platform in Xinzhou

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's gone

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Gone

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What is the reason?

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because no one talked

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So no one noticed

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then this number didn't call

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Where is Xia Xinnan?

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Did she talk?

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, I went to the hospital with her

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The doctor confirmed that the girl was really

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Injured and lost her voice

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She is still being treated

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think she knows what it is

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A serial killer who was wanted for 10 years

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In a tourist area

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Two students chased and ran away

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's too coincidental

238
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know what to do

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Boss, what should we do now?

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A wanted criminal for 10 years

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Which clue should we start with?

242
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This case

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Looks like the murderer is already here

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But there are many things that are not clear

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's start with the most obvious

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
In the surveillance just now

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
When Feng Bin was on the road

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No one in the police station

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Was there

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's so coincidental

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Everyone was not there

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's discuss it first

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Xiao Qiao, did the students and teachers of Feng Bin School come?

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Before the other students who ran away

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do the analysis on these students

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Tao Ze, go to the hospital and guard that girl

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If the situation is allowed, ask for permission as soon as possible

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
All the doubts about the case

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Have to fall on her

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Connect to the police station

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Transfer all the staff who worked yesterday

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Boss, is it that my work is not going well?

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why do you, Tao Fu, Xiao Yanjing

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Are familiar with the case of 327?

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know anything

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, go ahead and do your work

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Captain Luo

271
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Have you heard of the 327 serial robbery murder case?

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The main suspect of that case, Du Guosheng

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is still on the run now

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Things from ten years ago

275
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Do you remember it better than me?

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why don't you understand?

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
To be an SID?

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
My childhood dream is to be an SID

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I suspect

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Some people have changed

281
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Where were you at ten thirty last night?

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Security room

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I remembered wrongly

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was in the search group

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Hello, this is SID

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hello

287
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They seem to have gone over there

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
After eight o'clock

289
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The surveillance cameras in the area

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Didn't capture any information

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Did you receive any instructions?

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Absolutely not, we just played a little

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We were doing this all night

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We were doing this all night

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Guangli

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why did you run away?

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What's the situation?

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The school is under too much pressure

299
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The festival is coming

300
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We want to relax

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Then why did you turn off your phone?

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
To avoid being found

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Feng Bin bought us a new phone card

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I was wrong

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Captain Luo, the information you asked for

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Thanks

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Captain Luo

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Captain Luo

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Captain Luo

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You can't go out for a week

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's cold

312
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What if something happens to you?

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What should we do?

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's go home

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Wait a minute

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's go

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Sir, is there anything else?

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What's your name?

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Zhang Yifan

320
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you have anything to tell us?

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm asking you

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Just say it

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Go home

326
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Be gentle, what are you doing?

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I just saw the news

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Didn't you say that the students who ran away from school were found?

329
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And locked the suspect

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The murderer is a criminal who killed three people in a row

331
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He has been wanted for ten years

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Du Guosheng

333
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The case of the 327 case before the autopsy

334
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I saw it in the case of Xinzhou Political and Legal University

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But since the murderer has been identified

336
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Why are we still going to the crime scene?

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There are too many doubts about this case

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't you think it's strange?

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A murderer who has been wanted for ten years

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why did Zhang Yifan go to the crime scene?

341
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It seems that he is not afraid of being photographed

342
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And even if the murderer is full

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And has nothing to do

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He wants to go for a walk

345
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why is it so coincidental?

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't understand the two students who happened to leave school

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The most incomprehensible thing is

348
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The death of the victim was a security call

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No hand signal was sent

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But this call only lasted three seconds

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's really strange

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But it's possible

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
After all, it was being chased

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Maybe it happened in an emergency

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
before he could talk

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't know

357
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So I want to go to the scene again

358
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
See if I can restore the original case

359
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
By the way

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I saw your letter

361
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I read it many times

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I always feel something wrong

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But what's wrong with it?

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't say it at once

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How is your relationship with your classmates in school?

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Relationship with classmates?

367
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Why do you ask?

368
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The beginning of the letter

369
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
is the dear parents

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But it's not written to the parents

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We are all anxious

372
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There is no one who really cares about the young

373
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What I wanted before

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't want it now

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And the beginning

376
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I think about what I'm doing for the sake of it

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't know if there is any hint

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That boy

379
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He won't be isolated

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
by the school

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He is a middle school student

382
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He is not bad

383
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He is good at home

384
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He has learned music for several years

385
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He is not outstanding in other aspects

386
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He is a good person

387
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He is not cold-hearted

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But back to the point

389
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The students who ran away

390
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
are all like this

391
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Except for Xia Xinan

392
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Xia Xinan?

393
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The witness of the crime last night

394
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He is a teacher

395
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He is difficult to manage

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He has no common language with Tongning people

397
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He is a bit different in class

398
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What about the others?

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Did you explain

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the reason why you ran away?

401
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I have an explanation for Xiaopang

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Because the school is too stressful

403
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He wants to go out for a holiday

404
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The reason is too difficult

405
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
At their age

406
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They can say whatever reason

407
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
When I was 15 or 16

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I planned to run away from the base

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I took the whole basketball team to the next room

410
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We played for half a month

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Finally

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We got the first prize

413
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We got a basketball with a star autograph

414
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
We haven't had enough

415
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
We were so fat

416
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You think it's funny, right?

417
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But we thought we were

418
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so big

419
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's different

420
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What do you mean?

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The reason why you ran away

422
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
is really

423
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
difficult

424
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But you have a clear purpose

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You want to play basketball

426
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
After all, you planned such a big event

427
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You have a clear purpose

428
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's because of Feng Bin and others

429
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
They ran away for three days

430
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
They just posted a post

431
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
They didn't post anything

432
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's not normal

433
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's not normal

434
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't you think it's weird?

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes

436
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What do you think

437
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
their real purpose is?

438
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
If Feng Bin's death

439
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
is the purpose of this escape

440
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
If everything

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
is for the meeting

442
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
with the wanted criminal

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's here

444
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Feng Bin and Xia Xinnan

445
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
first met Du Guosheng

446
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Feng Bin was

447
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
stabbed by Du Guosheng

448
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
who was not sure where he was from

449
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
After the stabbing

450
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Feng Bin and Du Guosheng had a short fight

451
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Feng Bin hit Du Guosheng

452
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
with the shopping bag

453
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and he was hit by a car

454
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Then they ran away in this direction

455
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Let's go

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What did you find?

457
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Bro

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Can you do me a favor?

459
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Can you stand there

460
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and pretend to be Xia Xinnan?

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You may have to suffer

462
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
for a while

463
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What?

464
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
No matter what Feng Bin's purpose is

465
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Feng Bin's death

466
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
is not a good thing

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What is Feng Bin's purpose?

468
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He came to the Jiyun City in the middle of the night

469
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and before he was stabbed

470
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
he kept this position

471
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
for a long time

472
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
There is only one reason

473
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That is to stand in front of him

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
They are really a couple

475
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Then?

476
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Look left and right

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
No matter what Feng Bin was doing

478
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Hugging or kissing

479
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
At this time, both sides of Feng Bin

480
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
are a straight line

481
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and there are lights

482
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So Du Guosheng

483
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
no matter which direction

484
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
he went to the Jiyun City

485
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Feng Bin should have seen him

486
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
long ago

487
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Unless

488
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He was waiting here long ago

489
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Feng Bin might have wanted to

490
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
bring Xia Xinnan to confess

491
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
or just to have a simple love

492
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But

493
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
a murderer who had been wanted for ten years

494
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
killed them

495
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He was waiting here

496
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
for this couple to come to the Jiyun City

497
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
At this time

498
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
he cut off the back of his hand

499
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Although Feng Bin was cut off

500
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
he still resisted Du Guosheng's attack

501
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
to protect his daughter

502
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and his daughter's record

503
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So Du Guosheng's target

504
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to come to Ye Langgu

505
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
was Feng Bin

506
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
A wanted criminal who had been wanted for ten years

507
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
A new student

508
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Why did Du Guosheng

509
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
take the risk of being arrested

510
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and kill him for a reason

511
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What are their views?

512
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm afraid we have to go to the crime scene

513
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and ask them

514
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This way

515
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This way

516
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's okay, Senior

517
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Don't worry about me

518
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I can do it myself

519
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
According to our crime scene

520
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Feng Bin and Xia Xinnan

521
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
escaped from Du Guosheng

522
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
They hid from the criminal

523
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and then they ran away

524
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
for some reason

525
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
At the door, they met Du Guosheng

526
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Feng Bin fought with Du Guosheng

527
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and was killed by Du Guosheng

528
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Xia Xinnan escaped from here

529
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It seems reasonable

530
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But there are many doubts

531
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Let's start from the most certain

532
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Feng Bin, who was hurt by Xia Xinnan

533
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
hid here

534
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Feng Bin was hurt

535
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and left a mark here

536
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Xia Xinnan tied her hair

537
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and was about to explode

538
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Feng Bin was about to call

539
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Wait

540
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Feng Bin called here

541
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes

542
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This is the first doubt

543
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This is the first doubt

544
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
According to Feng Bin's phone number

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we checked all the calls

546
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
at 10.34

547
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
There was a call

548
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
from this number

549
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But this call only lasted for 3 seconds

550
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
No sound was heard

551
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Can we be sure that

552
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
this call was made by these two students?

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Feng Bin's phone

554
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
only had him and Xia Xinnan

555
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And before that

556
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
the two students were being chased

557
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I guess

558
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
only when we get to a relatively safe place

559
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
we can call

560
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I know your doubt

561
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If Feng Bin

562
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
had time to call here

563
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
why did this call

564
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
only last for 3 seconds?

565
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So what was the reason

566
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that you hung up on me?

567
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What if Du Guosheng

568
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
found them?

569
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No

570
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
If Du Guosheng

571
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
found them

572
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Du Guosheng should have

573
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
pushed the door in

574
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So the crime scene should be here

575
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and not outside

576
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Even if Du Guosheng passed by

577
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
if he just passed by

578
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
it would prove the place is safe

579
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
As long as Feng Bin doesn't go out

580
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
they would have enough time to call again

581
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
One whole night

582
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
only one call

583
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
What if

584
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
it wasn't a passive call?

585
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You mean

586
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
one of them

587
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
hung up on you?

588
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Why?

589
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes

590
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Why?

591
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Why would a

592
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
killer who chased him all night

593
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
give up on his life?

594
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And it was the only chance

595
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
to survive

596
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Senior

597
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What's the second reason?

598
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
They hung up on me

599
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and were going to leave

600
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But before they left

601
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I did something I couldn't understand

602
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
He opened the trash can

603
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Did you find anything?

604
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
No

605
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
This is

606
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
This is the third reason

607
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Du Guosheng's footprints

608
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
According to our analysis

609
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
this is a safe house

610
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Du Guosheng didn't break in

611
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So this footprint

612
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
was left by Du Guosheng after he killed Feng Bin

613
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The witness group also proved this

614
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
He was looking for something

615
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What was he looking for?

616
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Could it be

617
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Feng Bin's stuff?

618
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No

619
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What is

620
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
a killer who doesn't kill people?

621
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He could have let her go

622
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and he must have done it

623
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
There is another

624
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
obvious reason

625
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Why did they

626
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
leave the safe house?

627
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Maybe this place is not safe

628
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes

629
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But since they had time

630
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
to make the first call

631
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This place was still

632
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
relatively safe when they came in

633
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But something happened

634
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and Feng Bin felt he was not safe

635
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This also made him hang up

636
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and ask for help

637
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
and even let him decide to take the risk

638
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and keep running away

639
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
This is a crucial time

640
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
which played a very important role

641
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
in turning the situation around

642
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think this turning

643
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
has something to do with Feng Bin's stuff

644
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And this stuff

645
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
should have been with them

646
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but at the same time

647
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
it made their safe house not safe

648
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So Feng Bin threw it away and chose to leave

649
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
What is it?

650
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What did Feng Bin throw away?

651
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Du Guosheng must get it

652
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What is it?

653
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What did he throw away?

654
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
What should have been there

655
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
at the crime scene?

656
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But now

657
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
he is not there

658
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It should have been

659
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
there

660
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
There are two important things

661
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
besides the footprints

662
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
which were left on the scene

663
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
One is Feng Bin's phone

664
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And when we found it

665
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Xia Xinnan didn't have a phone

666
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
In order to avoid finding it

667
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Feng Bin bought us a new phone

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Xia Xinnan's phone

669
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Feng Bin's phone

670
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's go

671
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Let's go

672
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Xia Xinnan

673
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Let's go

674
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's go

675
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Let's go

676
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That's not it

677
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That's not the tone of the victim

678
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
What is the tone of the victim?

679
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Even the victim

680
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
grew up

681
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and learned to disguise

682
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and followed the mainstream social opinion

683
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
to fight against the group violence

684
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
When they think back

685
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
to what they did when they were young

686
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
they still show off

687
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Because they didn't think of the victim

688
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
as the victim

689
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
but as a result

690
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The root of the group violence

691
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is the order of power

692
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
within the group

693
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But the teachers and parents were there

694
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and they were in the SID

695
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
If they were bullied

696
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
why didn't they tell us?

697
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Brother Tang

698
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
A school with a good quality

699
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
can create its own environment

700
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Just like any closed-door stadium

701
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
it has its own rules

702
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The natural rules in your eyes

703
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
may be the cause of death

704
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Just like you suddenly told an ancient person

705
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
who was humble and civilized

706
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
we will live on the same island

707
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Will he believe you?

708
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Brother, let's go

709
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm sorry

710
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Xia Xinnan

711
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Can we talk about

712
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the group leaving home?

713
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Xia Xinnan

714
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't be afraid

715
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
This is SID

716
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
No one will hurt you

717
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
He still recognizes me

718
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I'm sorry

719
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Did you see this person

720
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
last night?

721
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
No

722
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Then why did he go to the SID

723
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and wait for you?

724
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Were you there when Feng Bin was hurt?

725
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Why did he kill one

726
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and leave one

727
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
when he was at the same crime scene?

728
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What happened that night?

729
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You and Feng Bin had found a safe place

730
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
to hide

731
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
and decided to take another risk

732
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You were the one

733
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
who hung up Feng Bin's phone, right?

734
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You stopped him from reporting the case

735
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
because you were afraid

736
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
that you would be found

737
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
if you had kept your secret

738
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The End

739
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The End

740
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The End

741
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The End

742
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The End
