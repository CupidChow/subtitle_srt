00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 18

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,080
Come in.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,240
Here.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,960
Ping Tingguo.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,400
Ping Tingguo.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,800
Where did you go?

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,560
This cat is not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
Why is it afraid of you?

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,320
Ping Tingguo.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,840
Where did you go?

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,820
Is she afraid of anything?

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,380
You and yourself above the sofa.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,880
circled under the sofa again

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,380
and there's a layer of soil under it.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Then骚到我的背硬,

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,660
tho....

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,600
For a while.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Have you checked the time?

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,400
I'll go and cook some dishes.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,600
Be careful.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,680
I don't serve young masters.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,840
I'll cook and eat whatever I want.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,120
Don't get into trouble.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Elk

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Happy birthday to you.

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Pei Su, what's wrong?

27
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Look.

28
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,000
What's this?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The money was torn.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
I took a picture of it.

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
It's his father's whereabouts.

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
This child is following his father.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Pei Su.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Happy birthday to...

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you looking at?

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know how to sing birthday songs.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you planning to make a wish?

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can also wish that next year,

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
your birthday won't be hit by a car.

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Happy birthday to you.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Happy birthday to you.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here, Sun Yuzhu.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Look.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Another year has passed.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not saying you.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You should do something serious.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When will you stop being a fool?

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The result of a rich material life

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is to make people more pursuing.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Instead of being like a fish that's caught in a net.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Young people can't be too empty.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They will eventually get into trouble.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's human nature.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
First, pursue warmth.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
When you're at ease,

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you'll feel comfortable.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You must pursue a higher sense of difficulty.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
For example, sense of accomplishment.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For example, self-realization.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Still being addicted to low-level life,

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that's self-mortification.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Time passes.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The hidden anxiety in it

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
will make people suffer.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Buy a villa today,

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
buy a car tomorrow.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Can it relieve the pain of this human nature

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and deep level of pain?

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The pain of not being able to afford it

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is more severe.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Senior Shun Hua,

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you still dare to talk back?

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you were in my house,

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
a child like you

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
would have moved to a bench

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and sat at the door to write a check.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And you're eating?

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There's basically no one to talk to when I eat.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Unless there are guests.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Otherwise, I rarely get to see my dad on the table.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
My mom is not in a stable mood.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She often has no reason to be angry.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sometimes she would just leave the food

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and leave.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Or she would suddenly sit

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
at the table and cry.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Eating at home is a very

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
heart-wrenching thing.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Occasionally, she would

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
be like a bell.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It sounds quite sad.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know which one is more comfortable

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
compared to writing a check.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's true.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Just imagine.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're carrying a small bowl

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and lying at the door,

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
holding a piece of paper,

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
facing the door of your neighbor's house.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In the summer,

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you would close the door of the house.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You would be able to see

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
what's going on inside.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You would be able to see

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the door of your neighbor's house.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You would be able to see

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
what's going on inside.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And your neighbors are all

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
your parents' colleagues.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Whoever passes by,

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
they would ask you.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey, kid.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What did you do this time?

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You really have a lot of respect

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
for your personality and dignity.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hello, Tao Zi.

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Old Luo.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's going on?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Tan Qing just came.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
She really lost it.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She's been in the hospital for a long time.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The Long Ballad

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can you go back to her?

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Chen Chen will definitely find her.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Boss.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did you get the parent's report?

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mr. Pei, why are you still wearing a armor?

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a small matter.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Chen Chen said that he reported a meeting class here during the summer vacation.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Usually, parents pick him up.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
As a result, his father worked overtime today.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He came an hour later than usual.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
When he arrived, he couldn't find him.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was repaired at the beginning of the year.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The teacher who was in charge just now said that

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the monitoring system now is basically not busy.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Before the escape, he had someone to check.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Go.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's the situation?

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The witness group just now

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
located Chen Chen's phone.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I immediately took someone to go over.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
As a result, I found such an old oil bar on the street at noon.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's still a canteen.

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There should be their special place to put the dirt on that street.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I've already sent the police to take over.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That Chen Chen.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This guy said

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
he saw a little girl

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
putting her shoelaces on the horse.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The phone was placed on the stone flower bed next to it.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He took the shoelace and left on his own.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The phone was left there.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He just picked up the phone.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Which street did he see?

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When did he see it?

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It should be at the new service club.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This guy found seven or eight phones

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that were going to be used.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's all the performance of today.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Take it back first.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's go.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go.

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The specific time and place.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This guy doesn't know either.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's okay, Xiao Chang.

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't talk about me first.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Brother, why do you look so bad?

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I asked Tang Ning.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
When Chen Chen disappeared today,

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
he wore a broken dress.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He was taken away.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If the murderer

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
kidnapped two girls

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
within five days,

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the rate is too high.

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,080
It means that the

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Chen Chen was kidnapped before five o'clock.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The distance is more than seven hours now.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's very likely that...

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Tao Fu, Captain Luo.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The girl in the photo frame has been caught.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Tao Zi, leave it to me.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You are responsible for talking to the parents.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
See if the child has any abnormalities recently.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Did the parents offend anyone?

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
How is the family relationship?

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't miss any possibility.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is there anything I can help with?

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
By the way, you saw me.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Xiao Zhang,

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
take him to take a picture of the suspect.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
By the way, let him help analyze the criminal psychology.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, let's go.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Go to the surveillance room.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Where is the surveillance room?

227
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'll go first.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This way.

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This way.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is she looking at?

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is there anyone outside the window?

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mirror.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The girl used the window as a mirror.

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just look at the scenery and turn your head.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You don't have to turn your whole body.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And look at it with a mirror.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She also used a round pen to curl her hair.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Girls all know her.

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait.

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:13:01,960
What is the location of the opposite side of the Shenzhen

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and the red house in the northwest corner?

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What is the situation?

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Isn't that the house in the north?

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The red house in the northwest corner is a public building.

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There is no surveillance.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What else is there besides the public building?

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Say it quickly.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is it.

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It was left when the playground was repaired.

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The fence broke and no one repaired it.

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So it's a hole like this.

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where is this?

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There is a small park outside.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's not a big place.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No one went deep.

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Are you going in?

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Ask someone to search.

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Do I have to take them?

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No need.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I need to contact all the children in the video right now.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Please follow our people.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Contact their parents.

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The sooner the better.

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
OK.

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Boss.

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where is Xu Dongyi?

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
At home.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He sent the taxi to Tao Fu.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
After our group left,

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
he drove to a restaurant.

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He packed it and went home.

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He hasn't been back since then.

274
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are you sure he's still at home?

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sure.

276
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
His curtains are not pulled.

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He has been in the living room.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He hasn't left our business.

279
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What's wrong, boss?

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Nothing.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Keep an eye on him.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't be careless.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Boss.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Did we suspect the wrong person?

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Xiao Wu said that after Xu Dongyi went home,

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the curtains were not pulled.

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's already morning.

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Still no.

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So he is very sure that Xu Dongyi is at home.

290
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But don't you think it's weird?

291
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This monitor's object

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
is too cooperative.

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
In theory,

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
it's almost perfect.

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
In fact,

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
the more likely it is that there is a problem.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll go in and have a look.

298
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You stay here.

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Wait for the kids to contact me.

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Inform me.

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes.

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's all my fault.

303
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I didn't think about going to see it myself.

304
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Mr. Zhang.

305
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It is said that the child tracking system on the phone

306
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
can be used to open and close the machine.

307
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The special investigation team

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
should have also used this way

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to track Chen Chen's phone.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why didn't you think about

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
opening his phone from afar?

312
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I tried it.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But I don't know

314
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
what the problem is with that software.

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It keeps showing that the connection is failing.

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It keeps showing that the connection is failing.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't know how to use that software.

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How did you become a father?

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Calm down.

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's okay.

321
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Calm down.

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
When Chen Chen's phone was found,

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
there was at least half of the power left.

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When you called him at 5.30,

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
the phone was stolen by the police.

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Could it be that the child found the phone lost

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and went out to look for it?

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The risk of being in Shaoning Palace is too high.

329
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The possibility is not high.

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It should be for some reason

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
that he left Shaoning Palace himself.

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But usually he won't go too far.

333
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But usually he won't go too far.

334
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So, as long as he receives your call,

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
he can immediately go back to the door of Shaoning Palace.

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But there are always troubles around here.

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It was the peak of the summer vacation.

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It should be that the police

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
are always on the run.

340
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There shouldn't be any danger.

341
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Except for the small park in the northwest corner?

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No.

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Chen Chen is very timid.

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Every time he read the story of the mystery,

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
he wouldn't dare to sleep alone.

346
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
How could he run to a place where there was no one?

347
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

348
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If he is not himself,

349
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
he is with his classmates.

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Mr. Zhang,

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
this is the first time you have tried

352
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to open a child's phone in the city.

353
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What is this?

354
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's a six-pin.

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Mr. Zhang always told me about it.

356
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Can you show me how it works?

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Use this.

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Connect to this.

359
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It keeps showing failure.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Stop!

361
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Search carefully!

362
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes!

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Boss!

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Boss!

365
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What's wrong?

366
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The teacher just now

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
contacted the children in the surveillance camera.

368
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is their registration information.

369
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
According to the memories of these children,

370
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
they went to the public office to change clothes.

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They are not allowed to go out.

372
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They are not allowed to go out.

373
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They are not allowed to go out.

374
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They are not allowed to go out.

375
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
They are not allowed to go out.

376
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They are not allowed to go out.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They went to the public office to change clothes.

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Then they went to the park to take pictures.

379
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Take pictures?

380
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
A photographer's child was going to teach homework.

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He asked a few girls to be models.

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Some children even brought pictures of clothes.

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Just a while later,

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
after taking pictures at the stone,

385
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Zhang Yu Chen said he was going back to the youth palace.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They were disbanded at the park gate.

387
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No one knew where Zhang Yu Chen went later.

388
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Here.

389
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Hello.

390
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That thief shouldn't have stolen a phone from Chen Zhen.

391
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He's right.

392
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The phone was probably taken down

393
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
when Chen Zhen was taking pictures.

394
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How did you know?

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
At about six o'clock,

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Zhang Yu Chen tried to look at the child's phone,

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
but failed.

398
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I saw that his operation was fine.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So I judged.

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
At that time, the child's phone

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
was taken out by someone.

402
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The thief picked up the phone at six thirty.

403
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The child was taken away by someone.

404
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The child was taken away by someone.

405
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The child was taken away by someone.

406
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The time of the phone was six thirty.

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And it's not necessary

408
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to get the phone number N.

409
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's not necessarily known

410
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
what software the phone has.

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So I thought of

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
the biggest possibility.

413
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Wait.

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's go.

415
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's go.

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Come here.

417
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Someone used Chen Zhen to change clothes

418
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
or hide his phone

419
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
when he took pictures.

420
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
After Chen Zhen took the picture,

421
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
he found that his phone was missing.

422
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Chen Zhen found that his phone was missing

423
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and wanted to go back.

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
At this time,

425
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
someone suggested

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
to let him go back to the park.

427
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's you.

428
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Let's go.

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And he told his friends to go with him.

430
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He must be very suspicious.

431
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
A child

432
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and a child.

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Chen Zhen.

434
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Boss.

435
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If I have told you my name...

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Fine.

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Boss.

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Was there a number

439
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
Hurry up. Why are you standing there?

440
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay.

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,200
The phone number wasn't from the parents.

442
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I think there's someone...

443
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
It's him. His name is Su...

444
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Su Ruowan?

445
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
She's Su Linnai's daughter.

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
She just turned one.

447
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,000
God of savez

448
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:11,800
Episode scratched

449
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,100
It belongs to my sibling

450
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,240
Ask your sister to go up to see him

451
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,180
Alright

452
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,040
Hello, may I ask if there is anybody talk to you?

453
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,680
My house seemed to be a little wet just now.

454
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,560
Didn't you stay?

455
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,560
Move away!

456
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,060
I hope that she is lying to you today.

457
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
Actually, we already know the truth about theoured tha

458
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,300
Schtoberberg still has no kids

459
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,900
But force could be K Sande

460
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,100
He is still in responsive to be accompanied by some frauds

461
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,860
So he is now half YouTube

462
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,200
They are even a little broke

463
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,380
but a full page has been closed

464
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,780
Remembering about old days

465
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,860
This is what Ma Deng said

466
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
he did really hurt her

467
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,680
Making Ziqi awake

468
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:39,520
This will fascinate Tell me where the

469
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,640
Happy trailer is

470
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,080
하게

471
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
Come back

472
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:33,500
The

473
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,180
Chen Zh sadness found

474
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,920
the phone fell

475
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,060
the first time

476
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,020
Be sure to make a call

477
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,260
how to send message

478
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,860
Su Ruowan is very likely to have gone to her own house to make a call.

479
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,060
It's Chen Chen who left with her.

480
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,860
They don't have any transportation. Chen Chen doesn't want to go far.

481
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,060
Su Ruowan must choose this place not far from the Youth Palace.

482
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,260
One kilometer.

483
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,460
No. 500 meters.

484
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,660
Su Ruowan

485
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,260
More than 20 years ago, where is the address of the registered address of Su Lingdai?

486
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,860
Wait a minute.

487
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,260
Hello, Xiao Wu. Speak.

488
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Boss, we installed a hearing aid in Xu Dongyu's room.

489
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,860
We just called him twice. He definitely heard it but didn't answer.

490
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,260
Did he find out that he was being watched?

491
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,060
Boss, it's here.

492
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,660
And we also checked the number of the next day. It's a fake.

493
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,060
The address is...

494
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,660
Luo Jielu. No. 56.

495
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,060
Boss, how did you know?

496
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,460
Call the police. Catch Su Ruowan. He can send people to the scene.

497
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,860
Go.

498
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,860
He won't care about me anymore.

499
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,460
He won't care about me anymore.

500
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,660
Open the door.

501
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,260
What's with all the noise?

502
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Is he going to sleep?

503
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,260
What's going on? Open the door.

504
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,060
Or else I'll report it to the police.

505
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,060
He's watching a horror movie at home.

506
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,460
He's just sleeping.

507
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,260
Only you people live here?

508
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,860
Sorry, Uncle.

509
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
Our master isn't here.

510
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,460
We can't just open the door for strangers.

511
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,260
I'll be quiet.

512
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,460
What?

513
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,660
Child.

514
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,060
Come out.

515
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,460
I'll teach you a lesson for your master.

516
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,860
Hurry up. Come out.

517
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,460
Uncle.

518
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,260
I'm sorry. Can I apologize?

519
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,860
I can't hear what you're saying.

520
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,660
Isn't it enough to make a big noise?

521
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,060
Open the door.

522
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,860
Hurry up.

523
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,060
Come out.

524
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,460
Don't move.

525
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,740
schools

526
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:57,700
тер что

527
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
I...

528
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,260
Why is there a child here?

529
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Where is the kidnapper with you?

530
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,840
Good for you.

531
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
The kidnapper has a child.

532
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
He can go to the jail by himself.

533
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,840
This is the first time I've seen such a hideous person.

534
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
It's Baludu.

535
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,840
Did the bad guy catch him?

536
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
He's caught.

537
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Little girl,

538
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
don't worry.

539
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
I've already controlled the bad guy.

540
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
He's caught.

541
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
There are people outside who are in the ICID.

542
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
He can't run away.

543
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
We will protect you.

544
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
You're still holding such a big knife.

545
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Aren't you heavy?

546
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
Don't be afraid.

547
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
We're here to help you.

548
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Did someone kidnap you?

549
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
Or force you?

550
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Give the knife to your sister.

551
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
And then take us to the victim, okay?

552
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Is she Xu Dongyue?

553
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,840
She used you to take Qu Tong away.

554
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Did she do anything to hurt you?

555
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Don't be afraid. It's all in the past.

556
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Sister knows you're a good kid.

557
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,840
These things were forced by the bad guy.

558
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
You don't have to worry.

559
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Go.

560
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Don't worry.

561
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
It's okay.

562
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Chengcheng. Chengcheng. Chengcheng.

563
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Are you okay?

564
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Chengcheng, are you okay?

565
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
What happened to your hand?

566
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
Are you okay, baby?

567
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Are you hurt?

568
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,840
What happened to your hand?

569
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Don't be afraid.

570
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Don't be afraid. Mommy is here.

571
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Mommy is here.

572
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Don't be afraid.

573
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Are you hurt?

574
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Are you hurt?

575
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Are you hurt?

576
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Mom is here

577
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Dr. Lin Shan

578
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
What happened?

579
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Look, look

580
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
What happened?

581
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Nothing

582
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Boss, can we apply for arresting Xu Dongyu now?

583
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
Yes, inform Wu

584
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
Yes

585
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
How is Chen Chen?

586
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Except for a little bit of shock

587
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
There is a little left injury on the body

588
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
The body is fine

589
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Missed for nine hours

590
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,840
It's a miracle to be able to find it all over the place

591
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
It's a miracle

592
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
It's really a long night

593
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Taozi

594
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Really a heavy and light goods

595
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
I saw you raised your hand for too long

596
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
It's a little awkward

597
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
So I moved the ladder to you

598
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Really childish

599
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Manager Lu

600
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
No

601
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Little kid

602
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
President Pei, are you okay?

603
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Little injury, I'm fine

604
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Did you find it?

605
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I checked the surveillance

606
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
This is rented

607
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
The owner's background is very clean

608
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,840
It looks like it's due to the failure of the red and green lights

609
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
A normal traffic accident

610
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
It's the same as your father's car accident

611
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,840
It seems that they won't leave this time

612
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Du Jia

613
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
The plan of the 13th District was blocked by them

614
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
You really guessed right

615
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
I'm not a bad person

616
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I'm not a bad person

617
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
I'm not a bad person

618
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
You really guessed right

619
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
The 13th District is really important to them

620
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Not enough

621
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I don't know what's hidden in the 13th District

622
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
How's the investigation going on the Guangyao Foundation?

623
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Give me some more time

624
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
The names of the foundation are all five-dimensional

625
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Everyone behind is abroad

626
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
It's complicated

627
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,840
I have to be in the Li

628
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Li Li

629
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
If I can remember a little more

630
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
You

631
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Don't push yourself to death

632
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I've been waiting for so many years

633
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
What's the matter?

634
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Send you home to rest

635
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm sorry

636
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
I'll be back

637
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Ok

638
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm sorry

639
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Xu Dongyu is here

640
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
In the program room

641
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Su Ruowan is in another room

642
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Xiao Qiao is watching

643
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Are you going to take the blood on your clothes and put it on?

644
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Put it on

645
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
But after the diagnosis of the disease

646
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
The blood volume is too high

647
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
The possibility of living

648
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Now the diagnosis of the disease

649
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Guo Shuai

650
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
This is Guo Shuai's team

651
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Tell me

652
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Sir

653
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Why are you

654
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
You went to me this afternoon

655
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Is it going to re-investigate the case?

656
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
My daughter

657
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I haven't found it for so many years

658
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I heard you just found a girl

659
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Still alive

660
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Is it true?

661
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Did you catch the suspect?

662
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Lian Lian's business

663
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Is there any hope to ask clearly

664
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
That man

665
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
He

666
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Is he a public criminal in Wu Guangcheng?

667
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Guo Shuai

668
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Now this case is still under investigation

669
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Some details are inconvenient to understand

670
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
But you believe us

671
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
We will try our best

672
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
For you

673
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Also give other victims

674
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
An explanation

675
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
You go back and rest early

676
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
I'm sorry

677
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I'm sorry

678
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm sorry

679
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
I didn't

680
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Let me say it again

681
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
I didn't kidnap a little girl

682
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
I didn't kill anyone

683
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
You have seen the car record

684
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Follow-up

685
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Eavesdropping

686
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Sound inspection

687
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
You all did it

688
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
I want to ask

689
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
You all in the state

690
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
The basic human rights of one person

691
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
To this point

692
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
This is in line with your special investigation team

693
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Maintain the foundation of every civil rights

694
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
If you have any meaning

695
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
For the special investigation team

696
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
You can respond to the surveillance agency

697
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,840
We will use this case

698
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
The procedure is legal

699
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Do a detailed explanation

700
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
This is the basic right of the New State Convention

701
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
But before that

702
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Mr. Xu

703
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Please fulfill your duty first

704
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Accept our interrogation

705
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
OK

706
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
You ask

707
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Su Ruowan took away a girl in the same school

708
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Implemented illegal arrest of victims

709
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
I called you twice during the period

710
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
In front of everyone

711
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
You are the one who instructed him to do all this

712
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Mr. Xu, what do you explain

713
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
I'm sorry

714
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Your special investigation team

715
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Are all not trying to prove it, right?

716
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Yes

717
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
I know that girl

718
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
So what

719
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
A call

720
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
A child's words

721
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
I'm a prisoner

722
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
I understand

723
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
What is the most valuable and most peaceful

724
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Why did Su Ruowan call you?

725
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Why did he frame you?

726
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
His blood code

727
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
And the blood of the missing Qu Tong case

728
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Have you checked it?

729
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Hai Yang is checking

730
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Because his mother and I

731
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Are lovers

732
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
I didn't say it this afternoon

733
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Because I don't want to

734
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Give myself any trouble

735
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
I was the one who buried his mother

736
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
I liked Su Ruowan since I was a child

737
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
But she doesn't like me

738
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
She prefers to live a life

739
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
That is not like a human being

740
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
That is not like a ghost

741
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
She doesn't want to be with me either

742
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Only when she knows

743
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
That her life is almost at the end

744
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Her selfish decision

745
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
To kill me

746
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Is a little bit of a problem for me

747
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
For this

748
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
I'm very grateful

749
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
I even want to marry her

750
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Actually, if it wasn't for her

751
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
To last this day

752
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I am now

753
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Su Ruowan's stepfather

754
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Because there is no legal relationship

755
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
So I want to adopt this child

756
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
This child is very difficult

757
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
I can only think of a way

758
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
I will satisfy her

759
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
All her requirements from the material

760
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
So what's wrong with her

761
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,840
It's normal for her to call me

762
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
But you didn't answer

763
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Yes, I didn't answer

764
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Because I know I was stopped by someone

765
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I also don't answer

766
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Even if this phone is not her

767
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Is a delivery

768
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Delivery delivery

769
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I won't answer

770
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
I have the right

771
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Before the gravity of the public power

772
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Keep the last bit of freedom

773
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Then according to what you said

774
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Su Ruowan is framing you

775
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Officer

776
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
This matter

777
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I don't know how much Su Ruowan

778
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
How much did she participate

779
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I don't know why she said that

780
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
But if it's true

781
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm really sad

782
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Her mother has been very protective of her since childhood

783
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
But in comparison, I think I

784
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm a responsible stepfather

785
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
She was raised since childhood

786
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
She was raised since childhood

787
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Sometimes behavior will be over

788
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
I have also trained her

789
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Maybe she has a little bit of me

790
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
A little bit

791
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Maybe she doesn't know what she's talking about

792
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Someone guided her

793
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
It doesn't matter what the reason is

794
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
I won't blame her

795
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
I just want to control you

796
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
You can investigate

797
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Use this to speak

798
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Don't try this

799
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
The old debt of the Su family

800
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
It's always been you who have been training

801
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
From your account

802
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Just go

803
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
You maintain an unrecognized

804
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
Why do you have an old house

805
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
You clearly have something to report

806
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
Officer

807
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
Only the house is protected

808
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
This is between kidnapping and murder

809
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,840
What is the inevitable cause and effect?

810
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,840
If you want to clarify this logic

811
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
All the cases in Xinzhou

812
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Are you asking me to be responsible for it?

813
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Listen to me

814
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Ask him

815
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Where is he on the night of the 27th

816
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Where are you on the night of the 27th

817
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
I'm reading at home

818
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Who can testify

819
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
I'm a free driver

820
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
It's normal to read at home

821
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,840
Why are you renting a car at home?

822
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Officer, I don't know what you're talking about

823
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
At half past seven

824
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
You drove with Zong Yiliang

825
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
A school bus left from Xiling

826
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
One of the eleven girls in the car

827
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
One of the eleven girls in the car

828
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
One of the 11 girls in the car

829
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
As a result, a kidnapper who witnessed

830
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
As a result, a kidnapper who witnessed

831
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
A kidnapper who witnessed

832
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
In the process

833
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
There is a girl named Qu Tong

834
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
She escaped from the car

835
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Met you and Su Ruowan

836
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Out of trust

837
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
She begged you

838
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
And got in your car

839
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
And got in your car

840
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
I didn't expect to bury myself

841
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
In your hand

842
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
I didn't expect to bury myself

843
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Where is Qu Tong?

844
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
I haven't seen her

845
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
I don't know her at all

846
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
I don't know her at all

847
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
The roadside surveillance of the school bus

848
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
I took your license plate number

849
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
I took your license plate number

850
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
What else do you have to change?

851
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
Then I want to ask

852
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
What time is it on the 27th night?

853
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,840
Don't you know?

854
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
I really don't know

855
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Okay, since you're pretending to be me

856
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Since you're pretending to be me

857
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Then you won't tell me

858
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
The exact time

859
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
But I can still say something for myself

860
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
If the case was

861
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
On the night before the 27th night

862
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,840
Then I'm afraid I can't get through

863
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
You know my home

864
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
From my home

865
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
To the West Ridge area you mentioned

866
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
It takes three hours to drive

867
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
This is still without considering

868
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
Under the circumstance of weather and road light

869
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Around 8.30 pm on the 27th night

870
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
I ordered a takeout at home

871
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
The order number and delivery time are all recorded

872
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
If you are lucky

873
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
The deliveryman may remember my face

874
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
So please try as soon as possible

875
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Return me to the door

876
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,840
It seems that I will be in your special investigation

877
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
Stay for a while

878
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
May I ask

879
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
When can I see my lawyer?

880
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
Oh right

881
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Although so far

882
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,840
I don't know how much Su Ruowan has to do with this

883
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
But she is still young

884
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,840
So please be kind to her

885
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
If necessary

886
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
I can pay the fee of the ex-lawyer

887
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Xu Dongyu is 44 horse shoes

888
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,840
We took all his shoes for identification

889
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Found that it was the same as the missing Qu Tong case

890
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
No shoes match

891
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
What is the result of the genetic test?

892
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
His genetic sequence is fine

893
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
What about the evidence that is not present?

894
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,840
We checked his half-year's takeaway record

895
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,840
Found very regular

896
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Basically all the sushi restaurants nearby

897
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
Everyone who delivers food knows him

898
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,840
According to the delivery statement

899
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
On the 27th night at 8.30 pm

900
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
The delivery man is indeed his own person

901
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
We also checked the car record

902
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
No problem

903
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Did we think wrong?

904
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
The one who took Qu Tong was really not Qu Tong

905
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,840
But Su Ruowan admitted it

906
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,840
And the broken flower dress in her room

907
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
Was also officially Qu Tong

908
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
Is there anyone else to control Su Ruowan?

909
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,840
I can only ask Su Ruowan

910
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
I can only ask Su Ruowan

911
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,840
to help me

912
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,840
I can only ask Su Ruowan

913
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
to help me

914
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840

to help me

to help me

937
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
to help me

938
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
to help me

939
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
to help me

940
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
to help me

941
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
to help me

942
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
to help me

943
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,840
to help me

944
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
Please come in

945
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Ms. Bai

946
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Accommodation

947
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Come in

948
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Please come in

949
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,840
What's wrong with your arm?

950
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,840
I had a small accident yesterday.

951
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,840
That's why I couldn't get the books and the internship card.

952
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Are you okay?

953
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Don't worry. I'm fine.

954
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
Sit.

955
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,840
I've prepared it for you.

956
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Speaking of which,

957
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
when Old Pan told me about this,

958
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,840
I was really surprised.

959
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
You said you wanted to study salt.

960
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,840
I didn't expect that you actually studied Old Pan's master's

961
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,840
and applied for an internship.

962
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,840
Actually, when you were treating me,

963
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,840
I've always heard that your lover

964
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
is a famous psychology professor.

965
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
I'm quite interested in this.

966
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,840
To be honest,

967
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,840
the common sense of the spirit and the heart of the victim

968
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,840
are quite common in the criminal psychology.

969
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,840
I think it's important.

970
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
Why?

971
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
Because I'm a man.

972
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
Why?

973
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Because the victim can't forget the trauma he's been through.

974
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,840
No one can.

975
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,840
No one can.

976
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
No one can.

977
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,840
No one can.

978
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,840
No one can.

979
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,840
No one can.

980
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,840
No one can.
