1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,080
Are you making it sound nicer than it is in the morning?

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,320
Definitely.

3
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,940
It smells great.

4
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,360
Okay fine I'm Thanks.

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,360
Are you picking up my stuff?

6
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,060
Tell him to take my drying clothes,

7
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,000
don't tell him where he got them

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,240
No thank you.

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,000
This is great and that's what you know.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,700
I checked the company's account and found that it has a large amount of debt.

11
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,500
If the loan is not paid back, the company's shares will be returned to the debtor immediately.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Simply put, this company has a hidden shareholder.

13
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,500
The name of this shareholder is just right, Guangyao Fund.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Does it sound familiar?

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
The company's shareholder is Xu Dongyu.

16
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,900
You remember now, right?

17
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,800
13 District, Xu Dongyu's shareholder.

18
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,100
That beach that has not been developed is in their hands.

19
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Don't you think it's a good idea?

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
The company's shareholder is Xu Dongyu.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
We're here.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,400
I didn't tell you the purpose of the trip.

23
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,200
You told them to search, arrest, and check the evidence and surveillance.

24
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,600
You told everyone to gather around.

25
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Only one person is left.

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,400
Zheng Kaifeng's disciple, Yan Bo.

27
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,200
It's me, Zheng Kaifeng.

28
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Come to the basement.

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,800
The car in front of us doesn't seem to be in a good condition.

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,400
It's so late and the management has probably already left.

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
And if we can't handle a lot of things at night,

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,200
it won't be fresh the next day.

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
If I remember correctly,

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
the cold side of this high-end transport is probably Zhou Shi's car.

35
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,600
It's not a car that can be used as a vehicle.

36
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,400
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,600
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,200
The cold side of this high-end transport is probably Zhou Shi's car.

39
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
So Zheng Kaifeng himself is very likely in the car.

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Follow me.

41
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,800
The car in front of us doesn't seem to be in a good condition.

42
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,600
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,800
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,200
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

46
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

50
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,800
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,200
It's a car that can be used as a vehicle.

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
My car.

53
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
Sir, let's go practice.

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Sir, do you need to clean the classroom?

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, thanks.

56
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Wait, sir.

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
You need to insert a security card in the gym.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Remember to bring it with you.

59
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,960
The target isn't in the right state. I suspect he might be running away.

60
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,640
Got it.

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
Someone might be meeting him at the underground garage.

62
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,560
Let him run first.

63
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,480
We'll cover all the entrances and exits by then.

64
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,720
You bring your men down.

65
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
When everyone's here,

66
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,920
we'll just sit in the garage and wait.

67
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Yes, sir.

68
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,360
You said...

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
I've been looking for people for days.

70
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,040
I've been kneeling and refusing to run around.

71
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
How did you think of escaping today?

72
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,360
If Zheng Kaifeng was in that car,

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,360
why would he risk his life to look for Yang Bo?

74
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,600
He would care about Yang Bo's death.

75
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Zhou Huaijin said

76
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,840
that he's been looking for Yang Bo for days.

77
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
He's been looking for him for days.

78
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,040
He's been looking for him for days.

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Zhou Huaijin said

80
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,040
that Yang Bo has been looking for someone to identify his personal relationship with Zhou Junhao.

81
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
That means he might not know anything.

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Zheng Kaifeng really wouldn't like him that much?

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
This way.

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
It seems you're right.

85
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Zheng Kaifeng is really in there.

86
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Don't move.

87
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Block the upper and lower floors.

88
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Come here!

89
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Stop!

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Take that car.

91
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Yes, sir.

92
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Stop!

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Stop!

94
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Stop!

95
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Senior, I won't help you with the fight.

96
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I won't bother you with this kind of thing.

97
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Get off the car! Get off the car!

98
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Hurry!

99
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Let's go!

100
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Let's go!

101
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
You two, stay here.

102
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
Come out.

103
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
If Zheng Kaifeng was really in that car,

104
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
why would he risk his life to look for Yang Bo?

105
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Does he care about Yang Bo's death?

106
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Watch out!

107
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Come on.

108
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Come on.

109
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Come on.

110
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Uncle!

111
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Captain Meng!

112
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Uncle!

113
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Captain Meng!

114
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Uncle!

115
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Call an ambulance!

116
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Hurry!

117
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Baesu.

118
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Baesu, wake up.

119
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Wake up.

120
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Baesu.

121
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Baesu.

122
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Tao Fu, Zheng Kaifeng and Yang Bo both died in the battle.

123
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
The others were controlled at the time.

124
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
The fans were on the side of the nearby car.

125
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
No matter how many of them were hidden, there was no big problem.

126
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Only Luo Dehe was close to the bomb site.

127
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Baesu, where is the family that you sent just now?

128
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Doctor.

129
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
You're his family?

130
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Yes.

131
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
The patient's heart stopped beating suddenly.

132
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
They're trying to save him.

133
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
You have to be prepared.

134
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
No, doctor.

135
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Doctor.

136
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
You're done in such a short time?

137
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Ma Hong.

138
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
It's useless to stay here.

139
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
You don't know how to treat.

140
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Wei Zhao.

141
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Go home.

142
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Don't make a scene.

143
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Come on.

144
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I'll carry you home.

145
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
You...

146
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
You...

147
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
You...

148
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
You...

149
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
You...

150
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
You...

151
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
You...

152
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
You...

153
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
You...

154
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
You...

155
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
You...

156
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
You...

157
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
You...

158
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
You...

159
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
You...

160
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
You...

161
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
You...

162
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
You...

163
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
You...

164
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
You...

165
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
You...

166
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
You...

167
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
You...

168
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
You...

169
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
You...

170
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
You...

171
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
You...

172
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
You...

173
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
You...

174
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
You...

175
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
You...

176
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
You...

177
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
You...

178
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
You...

179
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
You...

180
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
You...

181
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
You...

182
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
You...

183
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
You...

184
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
You...

185
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
You...

186
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
You...

187
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
You...

188
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
You...

189
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
You...

190
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
You...

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
You...

235
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
You...

236
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
You...

237
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
You...

238
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
You...

281
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
You...

282
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
You...

283
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
You...

284
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
You...

285
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
You...

286
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
You...

287
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
You...

288
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
You...

289
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
You...

290
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
You...

291
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
You...

292
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
You...

293
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
You...

294
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
You...

295
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
You...

296
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
You...

297
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
You...

298
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
You...

299
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
You...

300
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
You...

301
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
You...

302
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
You...

303
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
You...

304
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
You...

305
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
You...

306
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:36,040
You raise me up to walk on some new things.

307
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:46,040
And strong, when I am on your shoulders.

308
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:55,040
You raise me up to more than I can be.

309
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:26,040
You raise me up to more than I can be.

310
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:56,040
You raise me up to more than I can be.

311
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:26,040
You raise me up to more than I can be.

312
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,040
What's the third?

313
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
He's obviously hinting at something.

314
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
There's something wrong with the special forces.

315
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I haven't thought it through yet.

316
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I'll tell you when I've thought it through.

317
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Xiao Qiao, don't disturb the committee.

318
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
The rest is fine.

319
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Okay.

320
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Mom, I miss you so much.

321
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Why did you leave?

322
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Mom, it was to protect you.

323
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Only I left.

324
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:31,040
She can't hurt you through me.

325
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Pei Su, you're different from them.

326
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
You've always been a kind child.

327
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,040
You've always been...

328
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:02,040
But I'm tired.

329
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm really tired.

330
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
I know.

331
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
I know.

332
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,040
You're tired.

333
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,040
You're like a floating parent on the sea.

334
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,040
A wandering traveler.

335
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
You've made this house your standard.

336
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:34,040
It's been a seven-year secret.

337
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Why?

338
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Is it because you're still investigating her death?

339
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
It's been seven years.

340
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,040
You still can't get over it.

341
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Pei Su, you're too tired.

342
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,040
You need to rest.

343
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Pei Su, don't.

344
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Don't.

345
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Don't.

346
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Pei Su.

347
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Pei Su.

348
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Where are you going?

349
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Come to me.

350
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,040
You're tired.

351
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Come with me.

352
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Don't.

353
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Don't.

354
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Don't give up.

355
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Come with me.

356
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Pei Su, don't give up.

357
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Pei Su, come with me.

358
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Pei Su.

359
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
You're tired.

360
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Don't give up.

361
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Pei Su.

362
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Pei Su.

363
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Pei Su, come with me.

364
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
Don't.

365
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Come to me.

366
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Don't give up.

367
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Pei Su.

368
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Pei Su.

369
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Come with me.

370
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,040
You know me.

371
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
You can't get out.

372
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I can't let you go.

373
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:46,040
If one day you lie to us, I'll be very sad.

374
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Don't.

375
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Don't now.

376
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Don't.

377
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't.

378
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
What are you doing?

379
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
You can't go in.

380
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,040
The patient is still in a coma before he is out of danger.

381
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
How long do we have to wait?

382
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
The coma will last for a while.

383
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,040
We don't know when he will wake up.

384
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Pei Su.

385
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Pei Su.

386
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Pei Su.

387
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Pei Su.

388
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Pei Su.

389
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
He's moving.

390
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
He's moving.

391
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
When I called him, his eyes moved.

392
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Impossible.

393
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I called the next room before I went out.

394
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
He didn't respond at all.

395
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
You must have seen it wrong.

396
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
No, it really moved.

397
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
And not just one time.

398
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
That's what I called.

399
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,040
You're a big car.

400
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I'm a big car.

401
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:26,040
I'm a big car.

402
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm a big car.

403
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I'm a big car.

404
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I'm a big car.

405
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm a big car.

406
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm a big car.

407
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,040
I'm a big car.

408
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm a big car.

409
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,040
I'm a big car.

410
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I'm a big car.

411
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm a big car.

412
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm a big car.

413
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm a big car.

414
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,040
I'm a big car.

415
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I'm a big car.

416
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,040
I'm a big car.

417
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:02,040
I'm a big car.

418
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,040
I'm a big car.

419
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I'm a big car.

420
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm a big car.

421
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Your phone.

422
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Your phone.

423
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
The investigation is over.

424
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Our people have no problem.

425
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Director Du told me to tell you to go back as soon as you've healed.

426
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:12,040
You're not here.

427
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
We've all been working together to get the investigation.

428
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
From my point of view,

429
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,040
There should be no problem in our team.

430
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:28,040
But no one can guarantee that there will be a problem with the information channel.

431
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:34,040
It's hard for one person to doubt another.

432
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,040
There are two good news.

433
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Do you want to hear it?

434
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
With the cooperation of Wu Zhenyu,

435
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,040
The results of the economic investigation against Zhou's Group have been found.

436
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,040
We found that the three public welfare funds under them involved the fraud of the accounts and the solid evidence of money laundering.

437
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,040
In addition, they are also suspected of manipulating the market in Xinzhou,

438
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,040
And maliciously blackmail competitors and the party.

439
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
With these evidences,

440
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,040
The public opinion crisis against SID can also be temporarily eliminated.

441
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
And what else?

442
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
This matter is not over yet.

443
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
When we were investigating Zhou's overseas assets,

444
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
We found Zheng Kaifeng's overseas company, Audit Capital,

445
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:18,040
To pay the deposit and default account records to Dongxian.

446
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
But we didn't find this money.

447
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
The deposit amount is not big.

448
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Maybe when we were investigating, our people ignored it.

449
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
The deposit was not traced yet.

450
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,040
It may also be that when we entered through underground money storage,

451
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
We didn't have time to pay Dongxian.

452
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Zhou's brothers,

453
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
It's a commission and a plan to kidnap.

454
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Let SID intervene in the investigation.

455
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Zhou Junhao was in trouble that night.

456
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Yang Bo, as the secretary of the chairman,

457
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
He once called Zhou Junhao's driver and greeted him.

458
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
The driver said,

459
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,040
He said, in that call, it seemed to have revealed what kind of car Zhou Junhao was in.

460
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,040
And we found the tools for making hand-made bombs in Zheng Kaifeng's basement of the new villa.

461
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
You mean,

462
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Zheng Kaifeng and Yang Bo conspired,

463
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
One to buy the chest, one to be an in-charge,

464
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Planned Zhou Junhao's car accident.

465
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,040
After that, Zheng Kaifeng may feel that the matter will be lost.

466
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Want to escape with Yang Bo,

467
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
But we blocked the result.

468
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
So we started the bomb that was loaded in advance.

469
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
We plan to pass the pre-emptive.

470
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
That's a guess.

471
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
But it still needs some key evidence.

472
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
Can directly identify the key evidence of Zheng Kaifeng.

473
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
I have a feeling,

474
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
This key evidence should not be difficult to find.

475
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
This case,

476
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
It is very likely that the case will be solved immediately.

477
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Wei Zhao,

478
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
You mean,

479
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
Just like what we predicted,

480
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
From Zhou Hengchuan's case,

481
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
The black-handed people have been releasing clues,

482
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
And have been following us.

483
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
It seems that the case,

484
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
From which point,

485
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Has entered our business,

486
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Seems to be to meet our needs.

487
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I was the one who was the one who helped him lose the military.

488
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
I just wanted to say this.

489
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I was the one who was the one who helped him lose the military.

490
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I just wanted to say this.

491
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Do you remember Zhou Hengchuan's case?

492
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Mislead him.

493
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Give him a message that he thinks he is dealing with the poison.

494
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
And Xu Dongyu's case.

495
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
How did Su Ruowan know that there was a bell in the pencil box?

496
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Such a case detail.

497
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
And this time,

498
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
The mysterious delivery man,

499
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
He could have been able to destroy evidence for the rest of his life.

500
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
But he put a big piece of the mask in Dong Xiaoqing's house.

501
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Besides the criminals,

502
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
The victims,

503
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
And the detainees,

504
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
There must be a third way.

505
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Which has been leading us to the wrong place.

506
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Which has been leading us to the wrong place.

507
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
And further discover something.

508
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Could it be?

509
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
A few days ago,

510
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I was thinking of one thing.

511
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
I don't know if it was a coincidence.

512
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
Pei Su's father,

513
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Was also a detainee because of the car accident.

514
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Was also a detainee because of the car accident.

515
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
You mean,

516
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
These aren't accidental car accidents.

517
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
They all happened to be related to the same people.

518
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
They all happened to be related to the same people.

519
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
I told you,

520
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
We don't know what happened.

521
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
We don't know what happened.

522
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
We don't know what happened.

523
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
They all happened to be related to the same people.

524
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I've been free these days.

525
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
I went to investigate.

526
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
All the files that the cleaners had passed,

527
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
All the files that the cleaners had passed,

528
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Are all in line with reality.

529
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Yu Lian,

530
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Is in line with Zeng Zichuan.

531
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Hong Bo Te,

532
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Is in line with Xu Dongyu.

533
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Zhou Junhua, who was in line with the dead,

534
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
And Zheng Kaifeng, who is in line with the dead,

535
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Zhou Junhua, who was in line with the dead,

536
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I checked Pei Cheng Yu's information.

537
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
I checked Pei Cheng Yu's information.

538
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
During the time Pei Su's dad was in the car accident,

539
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
The cleaners

540
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Also happened to have a piece of work.

541
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
What is it?

542
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
The work in which Pine and Ying Chao were involved in the accident

543
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
broke Half.

544
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
How could they have continued with this planning?

545
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Topibu nochae

546
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,040
W Passion

547
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Con�yWhere

548
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
criminal

549
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,040
I am the first to discover the person here

550
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
A world of loss

551
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
An imaginary world

552
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I am curious who has lived there before?

553
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
I am curious who has lived there before?

554
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
What kind of life is this?

555
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,040
This is the happiest day of my life.

556
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
A new beginning.

557
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,040
I have the most beautiful love in the world.

558
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,040
I must put you under my protection.

559
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
No matter how big this dress is,

560
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
look at your face.

561
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,040
It's almost enough to fit me.

562
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,040
What a beautiful bride.

563
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,040
What a beautiful bride.

564
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,040
I can't control my thoughts.

565
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,040
I can't control my thoughts.

566
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
You can't do this to me.

567
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
You are still like an idiot.

568
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,040
I can't control my thoughts.

569
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,040
I just want you to kill me.

570
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,040
