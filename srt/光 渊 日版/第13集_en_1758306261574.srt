Episode 18

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Boss, this is the surveillance footage.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,080
Boss, Tang Fu just called.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,640
He said that Dong Xiao Qing's house is empty and that he lost his temper.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,000
Boss, look.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,720
It's this car. This bastard Gao Zi.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,440
He was covered in blood.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,520
He didn't even show a single hair.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,400
This must not be the first time he did something like this.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,040
He drove around at this speed and hit people.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,840
He was beaten up and then he ran over a car.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,720
Boss, are you okay?

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,920
Should we call the doctor to deal with it first?

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,320
It's fine. I won't die.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
We'll have the team investigate it right now.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,840
Dong Xiao Qing and Dong Xian's social relations, especially Dong Xian.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,480
The car team he works for, the client,

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,600
which rest stop he went to,

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,680
where he was, what he bought, what he ate.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,880
Boss, you should just pack it up. There's still blood left.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,320
It's still day time! We couldn't even find the bastard who was so furious!

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
Why are you staring at me?

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,520
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm not mad at you guys.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
This bastard

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,520
hit someone to death in front of me.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,120
I even let him run away.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
I really don't care.

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,520
You're fine. You're already dead.

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm not.

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,120
I'm not.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm not.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm not.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm not.

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
I really don't care.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
You're fine. You're already dead.

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,120
Who can stop you?

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
This bastard

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,320
on one hand, covered his face,

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,920
on the other hand, sent out car information

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
to let us investigate.

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,520
Boss, we found the owner of the car.

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,720
It's an ordinary worker.

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,120
He was just taking an exam today.

45
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,920
The parking lot near the exam center was full.

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
He was afraid of being stuck, so he specifically found a place

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
with no surveillance.

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Until we contacted him, he found his car was stolen.

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
Boss, we found the car in the surveillance.

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,120
Xiao Wu, watch the patrol team here.

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,720
Tianqiu, come with me.

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,520
Yes.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
Xiao Wu, come with me.

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
Yes.

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
Xiao Wu, come with me.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
Yes.

57
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

60
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

61
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

63
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

65
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

66
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

67
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

68
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

69
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

71
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

73
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

74
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

76
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

77
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

78
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

79
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

80
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

81
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Xiao Wu, come with me.

82
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,420

85
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,420
Boss,

86
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,460
there should be no evidence left at the scene.

87
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,740
Let's see if the witness team

88
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,100
can find any progress.

Episode 16

90
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,180
I found the person.

91
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,180
I also found Hengda,

92
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,140
who uploaded the video.

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,820
You're not afraid that the rescue team will be late?

94
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
They will fake the whole night

95
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,540
and kill you in the river.

96
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,500
There are outsiders watching the water.

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,780
If anything goes wrong,

98
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,900
they will save me.

99
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,380
Even if they find out,

100
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,060
I'll prove that they are

101
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,460
the hot-blooded passers-by.

102
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,500
You've been absent for a long time.

103
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,020
You won't find so many helpers

104
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,900
next time.

105
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,740
Is that not enough?

106
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,220
I'm the planner and the decision-maker.

107
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,020
The rest of them

108
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,500
will follow my instructions.

109
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,140
No need to involve others.

110
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,460
Why did you choose Baishan River?

111
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,340
Mainly to send the airport out.

112
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,900
Also,

113
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,660
the person who came to help

114
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,260
was from that place.

115
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,100
So, is this a hard-working plan

116
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,580
or a temporary abandonment?

117
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,580
You mean...

118
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,460
It's not me.

119
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
I'm not that capable

120
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,260
to kill Zhou Junhao

121
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,860
in Xinzhou.

122
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,740
I did this

123
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,900
just to get his death notice

124
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,740
and to take this opportunity.

125
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
I'm just a bright and bright

126
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,580
good-looking person in the group.

127
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,580
I'm not even as good as Zheng Kaifeng.

128
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,060
If I want to happen,

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,580
I can only do this.

130
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,620
I thought Mr. Zhou

131
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,060
is at least better than Yang Bo

132
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,980
in terms of identity and character.

133
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,100
Identity?

134
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,140
I'm just a piece of the Zhexiu Tribe.

135
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,100
My mother married Zhou Junhao

136
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,540
when she was pregnant.

137
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,420
I'm her

138
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,980
and her ex-husband's son.

139
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Of course,

140
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,220
it's just a premature birth.

141
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,980
As for the matter of my birth father, Zhou Yaohou,

142
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Mr. Pei,

143
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,060
you must have heard of it, right?

144
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,460
I heard a little bit.

145
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,700
Although Zhou's family

146
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
boasts of their noble family background,

147
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,420
they are the most important family

148
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
in the local area.

149
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,700
They are the most important family

150
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
in the local area.

151
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,020
But Zhou's family is the only one

152
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,500
who is the descendant of Zhou Yaohou.

153
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Zhou Junhao

154
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,340
was also called Zhou Dalu at that time.

155
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,340
He was the son of the Pang family

156
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,420
who was not in the Zhou family.

157
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,340
He was completely his follower.

158
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,180
Sheng Kaifeng doesn't need to say it anymore.

159
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,940
You were born with a leg.

160
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,580
You were still a muddlehead

161
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,700
who didn't do his job.

162
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,340
So,

163
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
you've done a genetic test.

164
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,580
What can I do about it?

165
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,260
I can't make a mistake, can I?

166
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,020
I have no illusions about him.

167
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,260
Huai Xing was the only son of his father.

168
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,140
He has been unimportant for so many years.

169
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,780
Not to mention me.

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm not afraid of your joke.

171
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,100
He didn't poison me to death.

172
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,860
It's already the result of multiple fights.

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,300
Mr. Zhou,

174
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,660
are you hinting me

175
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,140
that Zhou Junhao is a leader

176
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,020
who is not responsible for his actions?

177
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,380
Otherwise, how do you think

178
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
I died?

179
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,180
Did I really die of heart disease?

180
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,980
How did you know?

181
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,540
I justizes joining the team of the wrong team.

182
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
Out!

183
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,620
People who are going to die,

184
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,060
why are you still watching me?

185
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
I know you hate me

186
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
and the death of me and Zhou Yaohou

187
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
But you don't know

188
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,020
what kind of person Zhou Yaohou is

189
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I don't know

190
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
Zhou Yaohou

191
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
I don't know

192
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Zhou Yaohou

193
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
I don't know

194
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,020
Zhou Yaohou

195
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
I don't know

196
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Zhou Yaohou

197
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
I don't know

198
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
I don't know

199
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,020
I thought your father gave me a way out

200
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
to get rid of Zhou Yaohou

201
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,020
But it's still a dead end

202
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
It's time

203
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020
You don't have to mention it

204
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
You hate me

205
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
You can blame me

206
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,020
I don't regret what I did

207
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
I just hope you and Huaixi

208
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
can grow up well

209
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
and get rid of this family

210
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,020
Take my four-door bank

211
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
and the secret safe

212
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
This is the thing that

213
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Zhou Junhao knew

214
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,020
He should know you have this key

215
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,020
He shouldn't touch you

216
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Now Zhou Junhao is dead

217
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
I can tell you the truth

218
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
In fact, there is only one box of

219
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,020
heart-saving medicine in the safe

220
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Otherwise, I would have made him lose his life

221
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,020
He doesn't need to be so weak as he is now

222
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
Mr. Zhou

223
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
You just said

224
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Huaiqing is the only child of Mr. Zhou

225
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
That means you already know

226
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
that Yang Bo and Zhou Junhao

227
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
have no relationship with each other

228
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,020
SID moves so fast

229
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Yang Bo

230
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
is a knowledgeable and knowledgeable person

231
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,020
But he was promoted to that position

232
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,020
There will be someone in the company

233
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,020
At that time, the rumors of the dead end were spread

234
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,020
After a long time, he even woke up

235
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
So you found Yang Bo

236
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
and SID

237
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
and asked someone to do something

238
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
He didn't get the result this time

239
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
He won't give up

240
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,020
Why don't you give him the result he wants?

241
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,020
I gave him Huaiqing's sample

242
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
It's a great honor to have a dead person

243
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Mr. Zhou

244
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
You spent such a great effort

245
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
to make Yang Bo think

246
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,020
he is Zhou's illegitimate son

247
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
and give him infinite hope

248
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
What's the purpose?

249
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Yang Bo is a man who is a man of Zheng Kaifeng's

250
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
but he doesn't really like Zhou Dalong

251
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
If such a person

252
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
becomes a hostage of Zhou's

253
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
and even takes DNA to recognize his ancestors

254
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
he will be a dead man

255
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
So this is your original plan?

256
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
But the person in charge

257
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
didn't tell Yang Bo

258
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
that Chu Junhao died after being discharged

259
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
My plan was broken before it started

260
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
But when you heard his death message

261
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
you knew it right away

262
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
Although your plan was disrupted

263
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
it was still a chance

264
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
So you decided to kill him

265
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
and let him die

266
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
I didn't know

267
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
I didn't know

268
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
But it was a chance

269
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
So you first suggested

270
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Huaiqing's spy

271
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,020
to investigate

272
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:18,880
to attract his new

273
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
and release the message

274
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
of the dead person

275
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,020
so that Zhou Junhao can be completely safe

276
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
Zhou Jingran

277
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Aren't you afraid that Zhou Shi

278
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,020
will be in a bad shape from now on?

279
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
Even if you get it

280
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
it's still a mess

281
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
Now Zhou Shi

282
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
is Zhou Junhao's Zhou

283
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
and his bloodline

284
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
from before and after

285
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
are also part of him

286
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
He is a pervert

287
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
who carries the monster's genes

288
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
I want to make his true face

289
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
shine in front of everyone

290
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,020
As for the others

291
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,020
aren't they all people from outside?

292
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
If you also have a word

293
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
that has been growing in your heart

294
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
since you were a child

295
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
Mr. Pei

296
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
are you afraid to take it out

297
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
because you are afraid of losing your family?

298
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
Mr. Chu

299
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
I'm sorry

300
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
I didn't mean to

301
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
hurt you

302
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
Mr. Chu

303
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Is Huai Xing

304
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
also an outsider to you?

305
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,020
When you and your dog

306
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Wu Zhengyu were in the same boat

307
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
he knew everything

308
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
but he didn't say anything

309
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,020
He still cooperated with you

310
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
to get the message out

311
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
Do you know what he

312
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
said to Wu Zhengyu after that?

313
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,020
I don't understand

314
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
I don't want to understand either

315
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
I only know

316
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
that I only have

317
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
my brother's family left

318
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
Huai Xing

319
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
What are you doing?

320
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
As long as my brother is fine

321
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
I will be the bastard

322
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
He said he didn't understand

323
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,020
your business

324
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,020
He only has you as his friend

325
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
When I said his words

326
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
he even wanted to

327
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
admit the dog's backlight

328
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,020
for you

329
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
I kidnapped him

330
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
If you want to report it

331
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,020
I don't care

332
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
as you wish

333
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Huai Xing

334
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Huai Xing

335
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Look at my brother

336
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,020
Mr. Chu

337
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,020
I have a question

338
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
I really want to ask you

339
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
From just now

340
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
you told me

341
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,020
the whole story

342
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
about the prince's revenge

343
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
but you didn't mention

344
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,020
the woman you love

345
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
at all

346
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,020
It's like you know

347
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
why this woman

348
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
is so crazy

349
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Can you tell me

350
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
why she wants to kill you?

351
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Doctor, how is it?

352
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
How is it?

353
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
Mr. Zhao

354
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm sorry

355
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
We tried our best

356
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Mr. Zhao

357
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Du Yaoqing is dead

358
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,020
How is it going?

359
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
Zhou Huai Xing is gone

360
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
Wait for me in the hospital

361
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
Mr. Zhao

362
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Mr. Zhao

363
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Huai Xing

364
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Huai Xing

365
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Huai Xing, wake up

366
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,020
Wake up

367
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
Huai Xing

368
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Huai Xing

369
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Huai Xing

370
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
Mr. Zhao

371
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,020
What did you say?

372
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
SID has been fully involved

373
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm afraid you'll have to wait

374
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
for them to leave

375
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
If you trust me enough

376
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
I can take care of Huai Xing for you for the time being

377
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Thank you

378
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
By the way

379
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Actually, there is one more

380
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
important thing

381
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
I forgot to tell you

382
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
When we were in Zuo Yang Bu

383
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
and Zhou Junhao's

384
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:42,200
personal

385
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
What did you say?

386
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
Mr. Zhou, calm down

387
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
What did you say?

388
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Mr. Zhou

389
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,020
This is not true

390
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
This is not true

391
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Mr. Zhou

392
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,020
Impossible

393
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
This is impossible

394
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Calm down

395
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Impossible

396
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
Impossible

397
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
This is not true

398
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020

Man Qin

457
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
the consequence

458
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Shen Zheng!

459
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
Pei Su, what's wrong?

460
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
I'm fine.

461
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
Pei Su.

462
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
Pei Su.

463
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Pei Su.

464
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
Pei Su.

465
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,020
Pei Su.

466
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
What's wrong with you?

467
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
Say something.

468
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Maybe a little...

469
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
low blood sugar.

470
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,020
Low blood sugar?

471
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
You must be tired from the way I took you home.

472
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I'm really impressed with you.

473
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
You were 20 years old.

474
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
You could have a little touch.

475
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
You could have a little touch.

476
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,020
Low blood sugar.

477
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,020
You could have a little touch.

478
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Do you have any food?

479
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,020
How's the search going?

480
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Did you find anything suspicious, Captain Luo?

481
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Search?

482
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
I'm just concerned about you.

483
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
Are you asking me about poison?

485
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Wait for me to die from it.

486
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
I...

487
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
You little brat.

488
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
Do I care about you?

489
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
I'm just worried about you.

490
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
I'm just worried about you.

491
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
I'm just worried about you.

492
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,020
I'm just worried about you.

493
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
I'm just worried about you.

494
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm just worried about you.

495
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
I'm just worried about you.

496
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
I'm just worried about you.

497
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
I'm just worried about you.

498
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
I'm just worried about you.

499
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
I'm just worried about you.

500
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I'm just worried about you.

501
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
I'm just worried about you.

502
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm just worried about you.

503
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm just worried about you.

504
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
I'm just worried about you.

505
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
I'm just worried about you.

506
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I'm just worried about you.

507
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
I'm just worried about you.

508
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
I'm just worried about you.

509
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,020
I'm just worried about you.

510
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
I'm just worried about you.

511
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
I'm just worried about you.

512
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm just worried about you.

513
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Okay.

514
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Here.

515
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
Captain Luo.

516
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
You gave me poison.

517
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Wait for me to die of poison.

518
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Hurry up and drink.

519
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
What's the use?

520
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
I'm not drinking.

521
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
I'm not drinking.

522
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
What's the use?

523
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
I can't drink.

524
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm fine.

525
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
I'm just dizzy.

526
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,020
I've been in the hospital for a long time.

527
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
You often live here alone?

528
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,020
This place is far away from your company, school, special investigation team,

529
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
and even your mentor's house.

530
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
You're alone and have nothing to do.

531
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
You came all the way here to live in a haunted house.

532
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
This is my house.

533
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
Is there a problem?

534
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
Can I smoke?

535
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
This is the smoke gun your mother used before she died.

536
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
This is the smoke gun your mother used before she died.

537
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
I moved the location of the TV.

538
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
The piano that was originally placed there was also taken away.

539
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,020
And the vase that she liked,

540
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,020
I can't even see it.

541
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
I moved them all out.

542
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
I'm sorry, Captain Luo.

543
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
I don't smoke.

544
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,020
After she left,

545
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
there was no smoke in the house.

546
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,020
You made this house a signboard.

547
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
It was set on the day seven years ago.

548
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
This smoke gun,

549
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
I remember your father threw it away.

550
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Did you buy the same one later?

551
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
Or did you throw away the previous one and pick it up again?

552
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
I don't smoke.

553
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
Pei Su,

554
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,020
From the moment this life doesn't belong to you,

555
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,020
everything else is trash.

556
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,020
What we're going to do today

557
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
is to clean up the trash.

558
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,020
Why?

559
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
Is it because you're still investigating her death?

560
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,020
Actually,

561
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
I also have a reason to do so.

562
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Actually,

563
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,020
I also have a reason to do so.

564
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
I want to tell you something.

565
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Do you want to hear it?

566
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
When I was in school,

567
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
I always thought I was doing something big.

568
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
I just got to the police station,

569
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,020
and I knew it was all about the pieces of chicken feathers and garlic skin.

570
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
The only thing that can be used to make a case together

571
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
is your family.

572
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,020
It seems that it's not quite done yet.

573
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Later, I got to the police station.

574
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
Life is not that easy.

575
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Everyone knows you're a sharp-eyed and sharp-minded person.

576
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Especially Lao Yang.

577
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
What can't be heard, he said.

578
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
No one is willing to do anything, just let me do it.

579
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020
It's like having a grudge with me.

580
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,020
I stayed there for half a year.

581
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
I even learned how to resign.

582
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,020
The resignation report is fine.

583
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Zheng Qiao, the informant from the next district has come.

584
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
Come with me.

585
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
What's wrong? Not happy?

586
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Hurry up.

587
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,020
That was the first time Lao Yang took me out.

588
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,020
That's a man-eating gang.

589
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Help!

590
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
Help!

591
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
What are you doing?

592
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Stop fighting!

593
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Don't move! Be careful!

594
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
Master.

595
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
I'm awake.

596
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
I'm done. I'm going to be beaten again.

597
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
I've been through so much.

598
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,020
It's the first time he's beaten me.

599
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
He said I'm a bad person.

600
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
I'm not a bad person.

601
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
I'm not a good person.

602
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Although I don't look like a good person,

603
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
I'm always in his heart.

604
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,020
I may have been trained by him.

605
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
Siede Geng Su Bo Zheng.

606
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
Sometimes a lie is not enough.

607
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
I went home and tore the resignation report.

608
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,020
From then on, it became his old man's death.

609
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,020
But the point of this story is not this.

610
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
The point is,

611
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
Lao Yang's knee

612
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
has been injured since then.

613
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
The older he gets, the more serious he gets.

614
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
He wouldn't have walked the stairs.

615
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
But he was on his way home every time.

616
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,020
He died in the underground passage of the pass.

617
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
There was a man's death

618
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
50 meters away.

619
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Lao Yang was on his way home from work.

620
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
The location and the force of the wanted criminal.

621
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
The person who passed by the ground

622
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,020
couldn't have seen him.

623
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
He didn't kill anyone.

624
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
It's just a call to ask for help.

625
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,020
Don't come over.

626
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
Don't come over.

627
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
What are you doing?

628
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
What are you doing?

629
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
Stop.

630
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
I killed him. I killed him.

631
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
I killed him. I killed him.

632
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
Don't be angry.

633
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
It's just that you're so stupid.

634
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
You can't say anything.

635
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
The nearby police station is right.

636
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
That old lady lives nearby.

637
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
She passes by there every day.

638
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
She passes by the workers across the street.

639
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020
This is the one I couldn't let go of.

640
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
What was she doing at that time?

641
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
She was walking down the underground passage.

642
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
Coincidence.

643
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
The unspeakable consequences of the previous one.

644
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
The old man who died in the underground passage.

645
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Perfect accident.

646
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
I mentioned this question to the tribe.

647
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
The tribe led us back and forth to get the evidence.

648
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
Finally, we were left with nothing.

649
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
You know her.

650
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020
She is a good person.

651
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
Like this kind of unremarkable accident.

652
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,020
Even her close friends are not acceptable.

653
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
They often think of a fake murderer.

654
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,020
So that their grief can be bloodied.

655
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
Just like me.

656
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
You can always remember her.

657
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
Never give up the truth.

658
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
But you can't get yourself trapped in it.

659
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
I forgot to tell you something that day.

660
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
Remember.

661
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
The reason why you trapped me is not her death.

662
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
I know how she died.

663
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
I am that.

664
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
You know how she died.

665
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
You.

666
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
Hello, Tao Zi.

667
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
What's up?

668
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Hello, Tao Zi.

669
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
What's up?

670
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
Hello, Da Luo.

671
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
You know what happened to the owner, right?

672
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
The fire is out. We are coming in now.

673
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
It's human.

674
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Someone put some paper goods on the sofa.

675
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Did you find anything?

676
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
Is there anything worth burning?

677
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Not yet.

678
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
But we can get rid of it by the way of restoration.

679
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
That's too slow.

680
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,020
No, no. It's too late.

681
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
Is there anything urgent?

682
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Just leave it.

683
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
I'll call you back when I'm done.

684
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Okay.

685
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
Tao Zi.

686
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Tao Zi.

687
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Tao Zi.

688
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
Tao Zi.

689
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Tao Zi.

690
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
Tao Zi.

691
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
Tao Zi.

692
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Tao Zi.

693
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
Tao Zi.

694
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
Tao Zi.

695
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
Tao Zi.

696
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,020
Tao Zi.

697
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,020
Tao Zi.

698
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Tao Zi.

699
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
Tao Zi.

700
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,020
Tao Zi.

701
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
Tao Zi.

702
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
Tao Zi.

703
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
Tao Zi.

704
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
Tao Zi.

705
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
Tao Zi.

706
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Tao Zi.

707
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
Tao Zi.

708
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
Tao Zi.

709
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,020
Tao Zi.

710
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
Tao Zi.

711
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Tao Zi.

712
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020

713
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,020

Tao Zi.

759
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,700
Unparalleled

760
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,020
The number you have dialed is power off.

762
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,020
Sorry, this is a private number.
