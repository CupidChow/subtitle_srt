1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh

11
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She's finally starting to get drunk from the first round

12
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She told me

13
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The first round of bad behavior

14
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fan Suyan started to change

15
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Isn't it because of Huo Xiao?

16
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For Zhang Zhaolin

17
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Huo Xiao is not his first bad behavior

18
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Teacher Fang, I'm really curious

19
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What kind of gift did you design for Pei Cheng Yu and Ji Chonglong's first round of me?

20
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I won't let you down

21
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
When I first saw you

22
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought of today's ending

23
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That day, I saw Pei Cheng Yu

24
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Pull you out of that cabinet

25
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then

26
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He used a 2-in-1 metal ring

27
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
To put it on your mother and you

28
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And you

29
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You didn't say a word

30
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You didn't even shed a tear

31
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's when I thought

32
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
When you're full of desire

33
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You will definitely turn against Pei Cheng Yu

34
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You used the monster he trained to destroy him

35
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's the ending?

36
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A wonderful ending

37
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Wait

38
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Move back a little

39
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Look

40
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Within a month

41
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He started to make 3 sets of deals

42
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Could it be that he suddenly made money in business?

43
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
At that time

44
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He was only 20 years old

45
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And he was already in the hospital

46
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And he was still working at Jingjing's factory

47
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He was going to find a driver to work for

48
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And in December

49
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He suddenly started to sell his property

50
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What happened in the last two months?

51
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Will this money have anything to do with his first set of deals?

52
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Boss, look here

53
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Look, time

54
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ice Hive?

55
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
At that time

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He took Su Fei to the Ice Hive

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And then in January

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He saw him and Su Fei's fishermen kill the secret agents

59
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So where is the special day?

60
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Xiao Qiao, hurry up and find

61
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
During that period, did anything happen to the Ice Hive?

62
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes

63
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up, hurry up

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The secret agent's check-in is open

65
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Kill him

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
At this point

67
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you still controlling your own instinct?

68
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We know who you are

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Maybe I'm not what you think

70
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Actually, you two are not

71
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are not

72
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You are not

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are not

74
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are not

75
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are not

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Actually, you don't care about me at all

77
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Actually, you don't care about me at all

78
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You just need a fake enemy

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm not a good shot

80
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm the biggest evil

81
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But

82
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When your relatives died of cancer

83
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't even have a child

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you plan to count the money on me?

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If I'm not wrong

86
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You just need to torture

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And torture the innocent

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And torture the innocent

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then you can get rid of

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The hatred that fate brings

91
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I have a little question

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Everyone here is full of blood

93
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What right do you have to judge me?

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You are so arrogant

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
During He Zong Yi's case

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The one who sent a message to Zhou Hun Chuan

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
To stop him from killing

98
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It should be the mother of the murder

99
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And Chen Zhen in the Red Tally

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He is a poor bug who only wants to feed his sister

101
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You shut up

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And in the murder case

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
In order to contact Su Luowen

104
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Did you see the body of the girl

105
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That was buried again and again?

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Who buried her?

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What do you have to do with her?

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Luowen

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mr. He

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Before we can make sure that Mr. Zhang is caught

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I am a tool

112
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That needs to be used

113
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We can stop a two-step case

114
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And save a few girls

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But what can that change?

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Zhao Nan Group is the source of all the crimes

117
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
To act rashly

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It can only cause great consequences

119
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And make more people suffer

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Luo Bing

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Some sacrifices

122
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Are necessary

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, teacher

124
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I know

125
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Sacrifices

126
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
When Dong Xian and Dong Xiao Qing's father and daughter

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Were both killed under the wheel

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
When Feng Ming was shot by your Gu Pian

129
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And killed

130
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You two were killed

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When Feng Ming was shot by your Gu Pian

132
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And killed by the criminal

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do they know who they are sacrificing for?

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
When you drag these innocent people

135
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
To sacrifice for you

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you think their family will be like you

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And live in hatred forever?

138
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Luo Bing

139
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Luo Bing

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How cunning this person is

141
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
How he can deceive people

142
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't you know?

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
These days

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How many years have we waited

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And how many people have died?

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Luo Bing

147
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Just one step

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And we will be successful

149
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes, teacher

150
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Luo Bing

151
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Found it

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There was a murder case at Bihai Bay

153
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The victim is Hao Zhenghua

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
46 years old, he was stabbed to death

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
After being knocked out by the killer

156
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Three knives were cut in the chest and abdomen

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He was killed by the killer's head

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
All of his valuables and cash

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Were stolen by the Judicial Commission

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This person is not from Xingzhou

161
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He is a Qiao Ming from Gui

162
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hengwan welfare home

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because the director disappeared 20 years ago

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He was killed

165
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hengwan welfare home's director

167
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Zhang Zhaolin

168
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The first case of crime

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hao's house

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No. 48, Bihai Bay

171
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Go

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Go

173
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Go

174
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Go

175
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Chase

176
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Go

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Go

178
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I took him in

179
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
In the secret search of Bihai Bay

180
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I gave him a house for his bones

181
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But now

182
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This crazy dog came and bit me

183
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That young man named Du Guosheng

184
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Not only left his mother

185
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There was a traitor

186
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Even chased to the police station

187
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
His informants

188
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Those trashes were bought by you

189
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But his friends

190
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His brothers

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
None stood up to speak for him

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He was killed

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
With a paper and a coin

194
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
He was sentenced to death

195
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
His file was sealed

196
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
His name was killed

197
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes, there is such a thing

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I remember that unlucky detective

199
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't allow you to call him

200
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Don't allow you to call him

201
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You are a traitor

202
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So you are the one who killed

203
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And you are the one who committed the crime

204
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Just for this?

205
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I killed

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The people I should kill

207
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Really?

208
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Those cases of Pingdu

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Are the people you killed real murderers?

210
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Are you doing this for justice?

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I will give you an incontestable

212
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Definitive theory

213
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Duan Shuiyuan

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You can fool those stupid people

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But you can't fool me

216
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You are hurt

217
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You are covered with a human skin

218
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hidden in this society

219
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
With blood, murder

220
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Crime

221
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You are in a dark place

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
On the bones

223
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You are piled with your money, power and status

224
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But don't forget

225
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The sky is gray

226
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The books are not revealed

227
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Dinghai Bay, the ghost buried in the desert

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
They are all waiting

229
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
To tear your skin

230
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They are all waiting for your ending

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Zhang Zhaolin

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you confess?

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Ziyuan

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What kind of saint are you?

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Who planned to let that

236
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Unlucky Dongxian

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
To be the murderer of Zheng Hai

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And killed Zhou Junhao

239
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Who is the one who let the little bastard

240
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
To kill people with his own hands?

241
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't have anything to say

242
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But you do

243
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Are there few people you killed?

244
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We are half a kilo

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You are not guilty

246
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You have no right

247
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Go

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You are not guilty

249
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You are not guilty

250
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You are not guilty

251
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You are not guilty

252
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Zhang Zhaolin

253
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You are a hunter

254
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can't escape

255
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ten years ago

256
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
When you burned him to death

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Did you ever think

258
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You were trapped in this

259
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Small place

260
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No way out

261
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No door

262
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Burn

263
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Burn

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Burn

265
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Burn

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Let your men release Dong Lan

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Do you hear me? Release Dong Lan

268
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Boss, it's right in front

269
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh

270
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Boss

271
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let me destroy

272
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This awkward apple

273
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Mr. Zeng, Yang Xi and Zou Feng escaped from the abandoned warehouse

274
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
which is only five minutes away from the road.

275
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Is that your idea?

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Did you tell them that there are people there to receive and protect them?

277
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You told Wang Nobin to drive a car to send them there,

278
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but you found someone to change the fake key.

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It was because Zou Feng was an important clue for the special investigation team,

280
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and Yang Xi was just a useless person who could be easily bullied.

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is that what you said about your brother and sister?

282
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not like that.

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Mr. Zeng, you said you would save them.

284
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You said if they were exposed, you would send them out of the country.

285
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Don't listen to her.

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Mr. Zeng,

287
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
this is how you treat your brother and sister.

288
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's like...

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's like you're trying to get rid of a useless trash.

290
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No!

291
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Mr. Zeng, it's not like that.

292
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Mr. Zeng.

293
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Mr. Zeng.

294
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Tell me.

295
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Fuck!

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm begging you.

297
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Let Donglan go.

298
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I did it.

299
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It has nothing to do with you.

300
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's not like I didn't listen to you.

301
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Mr. Zeng,

302
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
what do you want?

303
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Zhao Nan Group can give you everything.

304
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Please.

305
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Let...

306
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Let Donglan go.

307
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Those children who were killed

308
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
are innocent.

309
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Donglan.

310
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Donglan.

311
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
How is it?

312
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Do you feel good to hear this old dog begging for mercy?

313
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Good boy.

314
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Pick this up.

315
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'll be right back.

316
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You killed Song Yi Ge.

317
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Ye Mou.

318
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Just live.

319
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Please go.

325
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's okay.

326
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Nobody's bothering us.

327
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Good boy.

328
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Pick this up.

329
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Kill him.

330
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Kill him.

331
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I can give you everything

332
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
that I've been waiting for

333
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
with this old dog.

334
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You just have to press it.

335
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This old dog who's been torturing you

336
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
will die soon.

337
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You and I have the best memories since we were born.

338
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
They're just our pets.

339
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Their lives

340
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
are born to be controlled by us.

341
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Right.

342
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You're so obedient.

343
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Press it down.

344
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Do you remember the thing that Pei Cheng Yu had?

345
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
He trained you to hold the neck of your mother for countless times.

346
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Didn't you always want to be a father?

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Press it down.

348
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You'll be able to achieve great achievements.

349
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm free.

350
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm not dying.

351
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Right.

352
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Press it down.

353
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Press it down.

354
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I only believe in the freedom of a person.

355
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I believe

356
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you're different from them.

357
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Theée

358
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You and me

359
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
are the same as you are.

360
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I am the wind that follows the wind

361
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I am watching you fall

362
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I am following the rain and the wind

363
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I am watching the wind

364
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I am watching the sky

365
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I am watching the sky

366
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I am watching the wind

367
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The wind is turning black

368
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Only you are standing there

369
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
With the most passionate heart

370
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I am sorry

371
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I am too late

372
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I am sorry

373
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I am watching the sky

374
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I am watching the sky

375
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I am watching the sky

376
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You are me

377
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I am waiting for the wind to blow

378
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I am watching the snow fall

379
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I am following the wind

380
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll see you later, brother.

381
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Brother.

382
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Not bad.

383
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You look much better.

384
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Come over tonight.

385
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I've agreed with my grandma.

386
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Let's clean up the table and celebrate your discharge.

387
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

388
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
Have you packed up?

389
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,560
Tang Ning will drive here later.

390
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,800
She can help you with the fire.

391
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,640
Xiao Xiao is waiting for you at home.

392
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
I'd better have dinner.

393
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,760
I want to...

394
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
go to this person first.

395
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,400
Speed touring

396
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,240
He went back to the nursing home.

397
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,160
I've put down the nurses there.

398
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,880
They can take care of life and death.

399
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,760
Mom,

400
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,960
in the future,

401
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
He has nothing to do with us anymore.

402
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I want to sell the villa.

403
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I want to buy a small house.

404
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Two bedrooms.

405
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
A big balcony.

406
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And a dream.

407
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
A little fatter.

408
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I can sleep with him.

409
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't know how to live a normal life.

410
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But I think this is a good start.

411
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What do you think?

412
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I want to live a normal life.

413
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I want to live a life of peace.

414
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I want to live a life of peace.

415
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I want to live a life of peace.

416
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I want to live a life of peace.

417
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I want to live a life of peace.

418
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I want to live a life of peace.

419
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I want to live a life of peace.

420
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I want to live a life of peace.

421
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I want to live a life of peace.

422
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Manman.

423
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We are finally free.

424
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Long time no see.

425
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Are you...

426
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
...alright?

427
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
If it were you, would you be alright?

428
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Pei Su.

429
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I've never met you.

430
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I've never met you.

431
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I've never met you.

432
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Right?

433
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You can say that.

434
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Not only me,

435
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
you've never met your father.

436
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Your family.

437
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You've been living in the Wutu Hall's tent since you were born.

438
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The handkerchiefs are simple and the tent is full of happiness.

439
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's not easy to find happiness.

440
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
But if you look outside,

441
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
you'll find that the things that are piled up are the blood of others.

442
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Pei Su.

443
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You ruined everything.

444
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You used me to ruin our family.

445
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Your family is just a lie.

446
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And a lie can never last forever.

447
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Pei Su!

448
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Why did you do this to me?

449
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Why?

450
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
You are my most important friend.

451
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But what did you think of me?

452
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
A fool?

453
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Did I ever do anything wrong to you?

454
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It's my fault.

455
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Dong Man.

456
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But if you do it again, I'll still be a fool.

457
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Do you really think I wouldn't dare?

458
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
What?

459
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
If you want to do something, just come here.

460
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But you'd better find something to cover it up.

461
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Otherwise, you'll be in danger.

462
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Be strong.

463
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
After about 5 to 6 minutes,

464
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
we'll be done for.

465
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You're a good person.

466
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You're different from them.

467
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Go back and live a normal life with Ying Ying.

468
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm sorry.

487
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I came back to turn myself in.

517
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Everything is over.

518
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm not going back.

519
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I think this place is good.

520
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's not winter.

521
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's bright and sunny every day.

522
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Besides, the ice cream here is much better than in Xinzhou.

523
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What about you?

524
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Do you want to stay?

525
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm different from you.

526
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Before Mr. Pei found me,

527
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I've killed Wei Mei Mei and bullied her.

528
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I owe her my life.

529
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I have to let her go before I can start over.

530
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe, as Mr. Pei said,

531
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
we're different from them.

532
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm not going back.

533
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Although we may not feel safe in this world,

534
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
at least we believe that there will always be light in this world.

535
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Even if there's only a little light,

536
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
it's worth our life to protect.

537
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I've said what I should have said.

538
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm not here to hurt you.

539
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm here to tell you the truth about your father's sacrifice.

540
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yang Xi, raise your head and listen carefully.

541
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I'm not going back.

542
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I'm not going back.

543
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,420
Three years ago, Yang Xi received a anonymous letter from the

544
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Office of the Minister of Justice.

545
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
He started investigating the old case of Huo Xiao.

546
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Their contact was anonymous.

547
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Then Yang Xi was found by Zhang Zhaolin

548
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and was shot to death in the underground passage.

549
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I think Fan Siyuan should have told you about this.

550
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Did he tell you that

551
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Zhang Zhaolin found out about the old case

552
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
without any evidence?

553
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Because the special investigation team has his eyes.

554
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Zhang Zhaolin didn't know that your father was investigating the case.

555
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Then why?

556
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Did Fan Siyuan tell you

557
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
who was the one who led the investigation of the Huo Xiao case?

558
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Who was the one who forced the evidence to be proven to be false?

559
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Who was the one who accused Huo Xiao?

560
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Who did Fan Siyuan hate?

561
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It was your father.

562
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
No.

563
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
He sent the photo of your father in the theater to Zhang Zhaolin.

564
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
No.

565
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Impossible.

566
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Whether you believe it or not,

567
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
your teacher Fan was shot to death by you from the beginning.

568
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Uncle.

569
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Han Yang.

570
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Han Yang.

571
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Help me get the cup.

572
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's in the cabinet below.

573
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Okay.

574
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Help me get a few bottles of wine.

575
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's in there.

576
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Okay.

577
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Xiao Qiao, stop playing.

578
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Come and help me get the dishes.

579
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Okay.

580
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The ingredients are ready.

581
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Get whatever you want.

582
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
This one.

583
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Coming.

584
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That one.

585
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Help me get the water.

586
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Here.

587
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Why are you alone?

588
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Where's the scarf?

589
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Watch out.

591
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's so pretty.

592
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That's all I have to say.

593
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I told Du to keep it from you.

594
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Don't blame him.

595
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Your mother asked me to invite you back for a reunion dinner.

596
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Whether you go back or not depends on you.

597
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Dad.

598
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Am I not reliable?

599
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm not.

600
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Did I do a lot of things wrong?

601
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You've been protecting me.

602
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I didn't even know.

603
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I didn't tell you about many things before.

604
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I thought you didn't go through a lot of things.

605
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I was afraid you'd choose the wrong path.

606
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But after all this,

607
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I guess I'm not bad.

608
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm not that bad.

609
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I'm not that bad.

610
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
If you throw it again,

611
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'll throw it to a place where no one can find it.

612
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Get lost.

613
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I said I'd go to Tao Ze's place.

614
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm afraid I won't be able to wake up someone who has no courage to run away.

615
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm not qualified to tell someone to get lost.

616
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Traitors who are trusted by the gang can only deserve this.

617
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I'm not that bad.

618
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I'm not that bad.

619
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I'm not that bad.

620
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I'm not that bad.

621
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm not that bad.

622
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm not that bad.

623
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm not that bad.

624
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm not that bad.

625
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I'm not that bad.

626
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm not that bad.

627
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'm not that bad.

628
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm not that bad.

629
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I'm not that bad.

630
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm not that bad.

631
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm not that bad.

632
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm not that bad.

633
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm not that bad.

634
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm not that bad.

635
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I'm not that bad.

636
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I'm not that bad.

637
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm not that bad.

638
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm not that bad.

639
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'm not that bad.

640
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm not that bad.

641
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I'm not that bad.

642
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm not that bad.

643
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm not that bad.

644
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
It's time for the countdown.

645
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Please believe in me.

646
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's time.

647
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Hurry up.

648
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Ten!

649
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Nine!

650
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Eight!

651
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Seven!

652
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Eight!

653
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Five!

654
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Six!

655
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Seven!

656
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Eight!

657
00:53:39,000 --> 00:54:01,240
minute oh

658
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Thank you.

659
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
Thank you.

660
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Thank you.

661
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Thank you.

662
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,240
Thank you.

663
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,240
Thank you.
