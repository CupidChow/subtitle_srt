1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's your relationship with Huo Xiao?

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Uncle Huo, he...

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
To me

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's like a father

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Just like what you found

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
After my parents divorced

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was sent to my mother's care

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My mother is a nurse

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She doesn't have time to take care of me

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Your Highness

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Your Highness

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Since then

18
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've been in Uncle Huo's house

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been through the whole elementary school

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When I was young, I wrote a novel

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
My father

22
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I wrote all about him

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My father is the detective of SID

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
When I grow up

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I want to be like him

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Enter SID

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Be a detective who can do anything

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My father is the hero in my heart

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is the reason why I came to SID

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The father of SID is the detective

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The father of SID is the detective

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The father of SID is the detective

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The father of SID is the detective

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The father of SID is the detective

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My father is the detective

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Liar! You don't have a father at all

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're the father of SID

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let me go

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let me go

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let me go

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm the father of SID

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
At that time, I thought

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If he was really my father

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How nice it would be

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Uncle Huo

47
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You should marry my mother

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Silly boy

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When I was in 327

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was in the sixth grade of primary school

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He was very busy at that time

52
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He didn't go home for more than ten days

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I saw the news of 327 in the newspaper

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was curious about it for a long time

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He...

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He died six months later

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've been staying at his house

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've been staying at his house

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been staying at his house

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know it looks very suspicious

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I know it looks very suspicious

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But there's more than one person

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But there's more than one person

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And...

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Listen to me

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And...

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Lu Guosheng has been in Xinzhou for so long

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How...

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How can we get his fingerprints there?

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He seems to have found some clues

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He seems to have found some clues

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
During that time

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He seemed tired and restless

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Next day

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There was a large-scale murder

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A man who was eager to save the dead

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A man who was eager to save the dead

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In order to identify the main culprit

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The court collected fingerprints and the data of Douou

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
On a beer bottle

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A fingerprint was accidentally detected

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It belonged to a wanted criminal

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It belonged to a wanted criminal

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Du Guosheng

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Such a long time ago

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why do you remember it so clearly?

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because this thing

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
has been going on and on in my heart for many years

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I've been reviewing it every day

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What Chief Huo said

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What Chief Huo said

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Where is it?

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
A large-scale murder

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
in a place called Senahe

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
in the city of Xinzhou

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Senahe

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Senahe

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It was one of the most luxurious

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
entertainment venues in the city

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then a fire broke out

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
because of the fire

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It was fined and forced to close

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
From then on, it was a secret

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It was a

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
very big accident

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The most mysterious

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I remember this thing

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
involved a lot of people

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It seems to have also involved the ICID

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because it was not just a fire accident

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
According to the statement of the survivor

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
who escaped from the fire

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that day, a special investigation team

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
had an argument with the team

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They put the leader's head on the table

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and died on the spot

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The murderer wanted to destroy the opportunity

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I didn't expect such a large-scale

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
high-end facility to be a fire station

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The design of the warehouse is also very unreasonable

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't be careless

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What's going on with the team?

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How do you know?

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't know the details

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know the situation

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
These were found when the investigation team

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
was investigating

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I only know that Uncle Huo was

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
investigating the crime of the 327 case

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and caught up with Sina and Youan

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
As for the details

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He couldn't have told me

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know why

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
it became

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Huo Xiaoyi was investigating the suspect

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and repeatedly took the bribe from the merchant

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and killed him

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He has a witness and a false witness

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If Huo Xiaoyi

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
took the bribe

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
would he live in a small neighborhood

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
where even the garbage can is not cleaned?

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Until he died

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
the most expensive power supply in his family

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
was still his TV

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
to

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
to connect the game console to me

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So you plan to tell the media

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that someone is hiding the fugitive Du Guosheng

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and then take this opportunity

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
to get the old case from ten years ago

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and force the special investigation team

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to re-investigate the Huo Xiaoyi case

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Since you know the details

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
why didn't you tell me earlier?

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You know how to investigate

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You are lucky to meet the dead monkey

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and catch Du Guosheng

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and end this case

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You are not lucky enough to see Du Guosheng

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You should hand over a solid evidence

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and issue a new wanted warrant

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You are not asking for a credit but a crime

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There were so many suspicious points in the Huo Xiaoyi case

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Who investigated it?

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The killed Feng Bin, his parents, friends came to the court

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
to make a scene

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You should investigate the case

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But what about Huo Xiaoyi?

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She is just a dead body

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The only mother in the family

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
died not long after the accident

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Not long after

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
she was gone

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Gone?

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Who will find the truth for her?

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Who will be so hard-working to remember her?

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who will remember her?

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You!

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is reasonable

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have to mention something

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The media nowadays

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
wants to make big news

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
to make people's eyes water

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How can they really lead the public?

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Not to mention the new news

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The stars look better than the killers

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Even if a case like Du Guosheng

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is caught in the dark

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and is only a week away

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
people will forget about it

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Besides, the clues of the Huo Xiaoyi's

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
investigation and the money

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
are already on the board

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
As for the plan

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
it is not something that can be easily found on the internet

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
obviously you know

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Du Guosheng is very likely to be hidden

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Feng Bin's case

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
is a bit cruel

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
but it is also a chance

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
for us to find the person behind the scenes

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and we can't just leave it like this

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And when you are in this situation

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you can break through the window

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and get the background information

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What will happen?

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If I were the person behind the scenes

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I would find a reason to kill Du Guosheng

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and throw his body to the special forces

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to solve the case

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
After all, this kind of thing is not even

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
a big deal

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
At most, it is a chance

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to get the background information

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Of course

220
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think your thinking

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is a bit brave

222
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Maybe it can bring everyone

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
a weekend without overtime

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
As for Feng Bin

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
a college student

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
who ran away from school in the middle of the night

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and was killed

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He used his money

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to waste public resources

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and investigate

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But the person who is really guilty

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
is not even a witness

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It is unfair

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
isn't it?

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you knew

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you would feel very angry

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
right?

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Nonsense!

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What? You can't even be angry?

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why did you run away?

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I know

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You think you gave up everything

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
just for a neighbor's uncle

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to wash the yard

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What do you feel wronged about?

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If you feel wronged, don't continue

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Manager Huo never asked you to file a complaint

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And if the complaint doesn't work

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
he will be full of resentment

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Poor you

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why?

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I...I am complaining to Uncle Huo

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Give me your ID

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I will stop your car for now

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't have a key

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Where are you going?

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I am going to Xixinan

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's go back together tonight

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
OK

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Did you turn off the lights at home?

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Where is Wang Jian?

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think I lost my watch

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Have you seen it?

266
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It should be in the study

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why are you here?

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Didn't you guys agree to work with Pei Su?

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
What is her story?

270
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,240
Your classmates have told me that

271
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
What are you afraid of?

272
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Hongbin is dead.

273
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
He died for you.

274
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Your other classmate was supposed to be an outsider.

275
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
It was because of you that you told us all these things.

276
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Your grandfather is now doing the electric wheel from home to the special team.

277
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
You are the one who is afraid of him.

278
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
You are afraid of him.

279
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
You are now doing the electric wheel from home to the special team.

280
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
You are still waiting for your news.

281
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Are you going to be a beautiful light that lives on the wall?

282
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Or are you going to be a person who speaks for yourself and others?

283
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Xiao Qin, I have a story.

284
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you want to hear it?

285
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Do you usually sign contracts with the school?

286
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
If you break the contract, you have to pay the scholarship you have already paid.

287
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
And the person who played the role of Fang Huan Jie

288
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
was not known before the announcement that day.

289
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
But this time someone kindly reminded you

290
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
that besides Hongbin, you are also the one who played the role of Fang Huan Jie.

291
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
There is another person.

292
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
This person has the right to have more rights than Feng Bin in school.

293
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
He asked you to sell the person who kindly reminded you to him.

294
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Otherwise, he will not only make you unable to continue in school,

295
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
but also make you pay the scholarship.

296
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,240
But your scholarship has already been given to your grandfather to treat his illness and to supply for his family.

297
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,240
You have no money, so you can only go to the house.

298
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
And then at this time, Feng Bin came to tell you that he had a plan.

299
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
He wanted to take you away and throw out these abnormal orders.

300
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
He could see that he had planned for a long time.

301
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
So you are the traitor of these people.

302
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,240
He said he was just testing Feng Bin.

303
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
I thought he was just looking for someone outside the school.

304
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,240
He was just looking for someone outside the school to beat him up.

305
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Or...

306
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Or he was being caught by the school and sent to be punished.

307
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
I...I didn't expect...

308
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Feng Bin's family is very generous.

309
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,240
His parents have a way to get him out of school.

310
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Someone can also find a way to keep him out of punishment.

311
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Feng Bin has so many ways to get out of school.

312
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
At the worst, he can transfer to another school, right?

313
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
But Xia Jinan,

314
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
no matter how you think, the value of life is not important.

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
People's memory is high and low.

316
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
It doesn't matter if you live two or three years.

317
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
But...

318
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
You may never meet someone who will give up his life for you.

319
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,240
How to distance yourself from the machine

320
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Your sauce said

321
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Yang Yuqing bet on you because he was too careful.

322
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
But the one énorming you wasn't him.

323
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
but someone who controls the instrument.

324
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Because of the order he has built up,

325
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
he is not allowed to meet a traitor.

326
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Xia Xilai,

327
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
who is he?

328
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Who is he?

329
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Don't be afraid.

330
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
This is SID.

331
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
No one can harm you.

332
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Xia Xilai,

333
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
where is your phone?

334
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Is it in the trash can?

335
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
The blood on the trash can

336
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
detected Du Guosheng's fingerprints.

337
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Why didn't Du Guosheng go after you

338
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
after he killed Feng Bing?

339
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
He just ran to open the trash can.

340
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Xia Xilai, what is in your phone?

341
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Do you know what this means?

342
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
If you are not sure

343
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
what Du Guosheng's main motive is,

344
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
what will you face?

345
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
You will face

346
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
at least ten years of money.

347
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Xia Xilai,

348
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
have you thought it through?

349
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
He was supposed to be a half-soul of the Holy See.

350
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Now he is going to invite you

351
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
to spend countless days with him.

352
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
As a cook,

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
he can continue to enjoy

354
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
his prosperous life.

355
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
Is it worth it?

356
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Xia Xilai,

357
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
look at him.

358
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,980
He killed Feng Bing

359
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,240
to seek the Holy See back.

360
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Don't you two even think about

361
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
letting me murder Feng Bing?

362
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Neither do I.

363
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
He was a part of your karst circle.

364
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
Definitely a perfect match.

365
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Look at him.

366
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
This one is likely one too much.

367
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
and then

368
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
I would go to school

369
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
and live a normal life

370
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
and then

371
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I would go out with someone

372
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
and then

373
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I would go out with someone

374
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
Xia Jin

375
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Feng Ping is dead for you

376
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
If he dies, will you still

377
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
cover up that main culprit

378
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
and let him die?

379
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Who is the person who killed Feng Ping?

380
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
It's Wei Wen Xuan

381
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Wei Wen Xuan

382
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Who is this Wei Wen Xuan?

383
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
The monitor of their class

384
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
He?

385
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
His surname is Wei

386
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
His father is

387
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
the chairman of Lian Hua Real Estate, Wei Chang Hong

388
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Can you tell us your details?

389
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
When I was in the beginning of the year

390
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
one day

391
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I was feeling unwell

392
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
and I could only close my eyes for a moment

393
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Feng Ping didn't know why

394
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
he suddenly came to my class

395
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
He told me

396
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I was the one

397
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
who was in the year

398
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
the year

399
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Lu

400
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
I saw how they made fun of me

401
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
So you are afraid that you will be

402
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
abused like this?

403
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Feng Ping said he had a way

404
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Did he tell you

405
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
in detail?

406
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Feng Ping said

407
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
he had a friend outside the school

408
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
who seemed to be very helpful

409
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
He could help us to tell us

410
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
all the messy things in the school

411
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Friend?

412
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Who?

413
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
I don't know the real name

414
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
There is only one

415
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I don't know the real name or the name

416
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
It seems

417
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
it seems like

418
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
the name of

419
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
the headmaster

420
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Qing Li Zhe

421
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
If it wasn't for this person

422
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Feng Ping might not have

423
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
dared to resist

424
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
He wouldn't have left the school

425
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
and all the things that happened after

426
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Qing Li Zhe

427
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
is a murderer

428
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Have you seen this friend?

429
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
He said

430
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
that person was out of town

431
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
but he would come back

432
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
when he was done with the party

433
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
and we would stay in the hotel for a few days

434
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
and wait for him to come back

435
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
But

436
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
it was not too late

437
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Why did he come back and go back?

438
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
Because

439
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
the day before he left

440
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Wei Wen Xuan found me

441
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Xia Xin Nan

442
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
What is the plan for the party?

443
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Didn't we already discuss

444
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
that Tao Ke would go to the hotel at 8 o'clock tomorrow night?

445
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
He

446
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
He said that he would choose me

447
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
because Liang Yu Jing wanted to

448
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
His mother is the headmaster

449
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Everyone else should follow him

450
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Unless

451
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Unless he went to

452
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Liang Yu Jing and asked him

453
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Tao Ke, what did you do for him?

454
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
He gave me a phone with a tracking device

455
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
Are you okay?

456
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Are you okay?

457
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm okay

458
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Hello, this is the Xinzhou City Emergency Exit Platform

459
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
You can't touch it

460
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
You can't

461
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Why?

462
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Xin Nan

463
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm sorry

464
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
It's all my fault

465
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
It's all my fault

466
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Wei Wen Xuan

467
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
He asked me to take the phone

468
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
He came back

469
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
and found this

470
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
He couldn't get out of the prison

471
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Run

472
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Run

473
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Run

474
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
This person and this person

475
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
can't even trust each other

476
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
This person and this person

477
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
can't even trust each other

478
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
This person and this person

479
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
can't even trust each other

480
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
This person and this person

481
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
can't even trust each other

482
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
This person and this person

483
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
can't even trust each other

484
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
This person and this person

485
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
can't even trust each other

486
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
This person and this person

487
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
can't even trust each other

488
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
This person and this person

489
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
can't even trust each other

490

covers

524
00:32:51,740 --> 00:33:17,300
She's gone.

525
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,640
Right.

526
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Did you have din t development on the night y

527
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:45,020
year

528
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,000
Ed

529
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,500
You've been living with your mom for so long.

530
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Why haven't you realized it yet?

531
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
How come I haven't realized it?

532
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,000
You haven't realized it yet.

533
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,500
Look, your mom prepared this for you.

534
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
You love to eat.

535
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,500
Look.

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,500
How is it?

537
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,000
Not bad, right?

538
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,500
Not bad.

539
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Dad, have some tea.

540
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I heard that your case was very complicated.

541
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
This matter has shocked you?

542
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I know nothing about your little matter.

543
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I am the Deputy Supervisor of the Supervisory Office.

544
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I also know that you are the Deputy Supervisor of the Supervisory Office.

545
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I also know that you have found the murderer of the 327 case that you have been investigating.

546
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Du Guosheng.

547
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Did Mr. Du tell you about it?

548
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The 327 case was a criminal case.

549
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The Supervisory Office was the one who sent the investigation documents.

550
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
If the case of the crime is proven to be done by Du Guosheng,

551
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
the Supervisory Office will not be indifferent.

552
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But you need to have evidence.

553
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Evidence?

554
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Dad.

555
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
There have been many major criminal cases received by the special investigation team in the past year.

556
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The Supervisory Office has been concerned about it.

557
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I doubt that the Supervisory Office has also found the murderer of the case.

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Wei Zhuang.

559
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Did you connect the network to this computer?

560
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yes.

561
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Since you have connected the network, it contains confidential information.

562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You put it at home like this.

563
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It used to be one person.

564
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Now there is another person.

565
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's too dangerous.

566
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Uncle.

567
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Auntie said the meal is ready.

568
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The Supervisory Office

569
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The Supervisory Office

570
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You're back.

571
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'll tell you and I'll leave.

572
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
These days, I've been looking for you for a long time.

573
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Why are you rubbing against me?

574
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Your work nature is not suitable for a person like me.

575
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So?

576
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So?

577
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Captain Luo.

578
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You have been working at SID for so many years.

579
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
There are no one thousand and eighteen hundred per person.

580
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
There are eight hundred per person.

581
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You should believe that you are a socialist.

582
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I am indeed that kind of person.

583
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I was born with a disability.

584
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I have a sense of responsibility and I am below normal level.

585
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I can't recognize the basic feelings of human beings.

586
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I can't control human behavior.

587
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
What are you talking about?

588
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I want to say that people like me are not worthy of trust.

589
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I am not worthy of trust.

590
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Captain Luo.

591
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
When I told you that you lost your keyboard, I knew that you did it on purpose.

592
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Because you always put your keyboard in the same place when you go home.

593
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You didn't think that I didn't notice this kind of news, did you?

594
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I have been thinking that the most suitable theory to determine the theory of a cat is not something else.

595
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It is the trust between people.

596
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Before you open the box, you will never know that the other person is your friend.

597
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I have been thinking that you are not worthy of trust.

598
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Before you open the box, you will never know that the other person is your friend.

599
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But once you open the box, once you start to doubt,

600
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
no matter what the other person thought before,

601
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the trust between you two has already been lost.

602
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Captain Luo.

603
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You have opened this box.

604
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You can ask me whatever you want.

605
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Why bother?

606
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
How did you know about the fire?

607
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And the cleaning car?

608
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
If I say that I have a robot cat that can make up all kinds of information,

609
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
do you believe it?

610
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The End

611
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I climbed up the mountain and took away my pain

612
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I sang but I didn't say anything

613
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I touched my fingertips

614
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
How many times have I been called by my name

615
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I call out to you when you open the door

616
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I will wait in the white light after the night is over

617
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,280
I don't want to regret that I always have

618
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
I will give it all I have

619
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,980
I will open the boxes before thehi

620
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,520
The usually I choose just one box

621
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,000
and replace it with another

622
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
How many alone wolfs have got you caught up with?

623
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,300
Killing the white light after hunting andlu subtitle

624
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,000
How many alone wolfs have got you caught up with?

625
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,000
Do you know?

626
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,980
Killing the white light after hunting andlu subtitle

627
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,000
Where are you learning to sing?

628
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,480
I will let you know

629
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
I'm the one who doesn't know, I keep moving forward

630
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,480
I keep moving forward

631
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,480
I pass through the fog

632
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,480
I burn in silence, in silence and persistence

633
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,480
In the abyss

634
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
I'm the one who doesn't know, I keep moving forward
