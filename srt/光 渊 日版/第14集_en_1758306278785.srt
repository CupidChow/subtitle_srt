1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,280
Eh?

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
You let go!

3
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
You've been playing for three hours.

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
You don't want your glasses?

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
You don't want to eat?

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
What's with the words?

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
You have no manners at all.

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
You learn from me.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Enough! Don't play 9527!

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
If you have the guts, you can invest!

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Enough!

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Don't be a coward!

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Enough!

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Whoever doesn't invest will be a grandson!

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Enough!

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Don't pull me!

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,280
You've been playing for three hours.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
You're still so stupid.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
I quit!

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
What are you doing?

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,280
You can't let go of your work permit.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Fine, let go.

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Don't pull me.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
I'll go with you.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Can't you leave some room for yourself?

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
I need to leave room for those who have written their resignation report.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
I need to leave room for myself.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I've been pulling you three times this month.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Don't doubt my determination this time.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Grab the thief!

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Grab the thief!

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Grab the thief!

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Stop!

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Don't run!

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Stop!

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Stop!

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Stop!

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Stop!

39
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,280
I told you I wouldn't knock on the door.

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Get out.

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Don't look at me.

42
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
What time is it?

43
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
It's 7.30.

44
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I can't read your nonsense.

45
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
What time is it?

46
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
You're lying here.

47
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Have you eaten?

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Hurry up.

49
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Hurry up.

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
This is a broken supermarket.

54
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
The people are too few.

55
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
You have to run 10 kilometers to buy a Chinese food.

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Living in this kind of place,

57
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
besides a little taste,

58
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
what else can you do?

59
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Have you eaten noodles?

60
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
I just threw up.

61
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
I don't want to eat.

62
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Let's have some fun.

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Come on.

64
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Let's eat.

65
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Let's eat.

66
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Let's eat.

67
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
If you're done eating,

68
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
come back to the team with me.

69
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
We won't take the weekend off.

70
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Any objections?

71
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
No.

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
According to my experience,

73
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
life is not as easy as it seems.

74
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
There are only two reasons.

75
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
One is that you can't eat.

76
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
The other is that you can't sleep.

77
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Drinking sugar water,

78
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
eating the kind of sleeping pills,

79
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
doesn't count.

80
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm going to wash the dishes.

81
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I've prepared the cleaning cloth.

82
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
First, wipe the oil off.

83
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Then rinse it with water.

84
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Can you do it?

85
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
No.

86
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Then learn it slowly.

87
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
People who cook don't wash dishes.

88
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
This is the basic principle.

89
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm going to wash the dishes.

90
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
The ash in the burning city

91
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
is similar to the ash in the city.

92
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,280
There's nothing worth being proud of.

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Why do we have to take it seriously?

94
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Why do we have to have an age

95
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
to be the head and tail of the city?

96
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Why do we have to be the head and tail of the city?

97
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Why do we need to

98
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
have a process of meeting and meeting?

99
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
You can't choose your background and environment.

100
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
But you can choose

101
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
what you should do.

102
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Because life, light, and earth

103
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
all have their own meanings.

104
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
You can't see or touch them.

105
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
You don't know what they are.

106
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
But the difference between you and me

107
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
and the chemical composition

108
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
is in this sense.

109
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
I used to think

110
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
that the genes are talking nonsense

111
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
when it comes to decision making.

112
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
But now I realize

113
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
that genes

114
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
are like a kind of ability

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,280
that can be used to

116
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
integrate students into the company.

117
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
The background you want

118
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
or the change you want

119
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
must be very difficult.

120
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
It must be very difficult.

121
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
But I always believe

122
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
that one's will to live

123
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,280
is more important than any objective meaning.

124
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Is it true that

126
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Dong Xiaoqing is dead?

127
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
I...

128
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I...

129
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
I talked to him many times.

130
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
I also evaluated him in private.

131
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
He would never be

132
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
a person who is a knife-cutter.

133
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Even if he has a negative emotion,

134
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
he is also a person who is

135
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
very direct to his father.

136
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
He has never been angry

137
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
with his family or car accident victims.

138
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
He is not like what they said.

139
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
My teacher asked me

140
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
a question before he died.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
He asked me,

142
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
do you believe in

143
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
the heaven's will

144
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
to take revenge?

145
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
I said, of course I don't believe it.

146
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
What era is this?

147
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I don't believe it.

148
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
I don't believe it.

149
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I don't believe it.

150
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
What era is this?

151
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
You still want to make a fictitious story.

152
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Besides, the old saying is always

153
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
self-contradictory.

154
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
You say that the heaven's will

155
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
is very direct to your father.

156
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
You say that

157
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
good people don't live long

158
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
or live for a thousand years.

159
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I don't know who I should listen to.

160
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I don't know who I should listen to.

161
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Then my teacher said,

162
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
you have to believe it.

163
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Because this is the meaning of SID.

164
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
The citizens gave you the mission

165
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
to protect this city.

166
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
When you were investigating the murderer,

167
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
you were the heaven's will

168
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
to take revenge.

169
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
The reason why this sentence became a fictitious story

170
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
is because you are useless.

171
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Because you can't find out the truth

172
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
and clear your name.

173
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Dong Xiaoqing is a human.

174
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
It's a fact that

175
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
he was hit by a car and killed.

176
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
His family was burned.

177
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
It's also a fact.

178
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Humans are very complicated animals.

179
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
It's hard for us to judge a person

180
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
by good or bad.

181
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
What we do

182
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
is not to judge a person

183
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
by good or bad.

184
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
As SID members,

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
our duty

186
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
is to find out the truth

187
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
and explain to those

188
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
who can't speak.

189
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Let's go.

190
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Do what we should do.

191
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Let's go.

192
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
The kidnapping case of Zhou Huaiqing has been closed.

193
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
He did commit suicide.

194
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Wu Zhengyu is his accomplice.

195
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
He has received the statement of lack of evidence.

196
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Now we can't solve the question

197
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
why Dong Xiaoqing killed Zhou Huaiqing

198
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
and why he was killed by the god.

199
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
It's not related to the crime.

200
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Did you get the result of the investigation?

201
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Dong Xiaoqing knocked on the door and hit the street.

202
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
He was shot and killed.

203
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Let's go.

204
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
It's very solid.

205
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Except for the predictability,

206
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
other physical characteristics are basically left.

207
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Stop.

208
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
15 minutes.

209
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
He is dressed properly.

210
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
It looks like a jar.

211
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
If it's just a fire, it won't take 15 minutes.

212
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Yes, he is looking for something.

213
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Yes.

214
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
After the investigation,

215
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
did you find any suspicious items?

216
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
We investigated the Dong family three times.

217
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
We couldn't find anything suspicious.

218
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
So either that thing was too inconspicuous

219
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
or that thing

220
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
was not in Dong family at all.

221
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
You mean

222
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
this thing was not there at all.

223
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
After the investigation,

224
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
it was sent to Dong Xiaoqing

225
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
by some way.

226
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Some way?

227
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
It's a delivery.

228
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Dong Xian's car team colleague

229
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
has reflected a situation.

230
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Dong Xian usually goes shopping online.

231
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
There are always deliverymen looking for him.

232
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I checked the purchase records of Dong family's daughter.

233
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I found that he did have a high online shopping frequency.

234
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
And the return rate was also high.

235
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Dong Xian's returned goods,

236
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
more than 90% of them were chosen to be fast delivery.

237
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I asked the fast delivery company

238
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
to submit the delivery number

239
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
and registration information of Dong Xian's

240
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
received email before he died.

241
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I found that before Dong Xian died,

242
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
there was a package sent from the car team to Dong family.

243
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Finally,

244
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
I have used the red label.

245
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Yesterday afternoon,

246
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Yang Xi and I left the car team and completed the delivery.

247
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
What's wrong with that?

248
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
If Dong Xian remembered it himself,

249
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
how could he make a mistake in time?

250
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
It was me and Yang Xi who left the car team

251
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
and completed the delivery.

252
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
So you mean

253
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
someone sent this thing

254
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
to Dong Xiaoqing

255
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
to assassinate Zhou Guaijin

256
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
and to prevent this thing from falling into the hands of the special forces

257
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
and then to kill him

258
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
and burn his house at the same time?

259
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Xiao Haiyang,

260
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
you are just guessing.

261
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
What else do you have to say?

262
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Don't treat me like a fool.

263
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
The team is here.

264
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Just say what you want. I know you have a good brain.

265
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Why?

266
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
If you don't want to let people find the evidence,

267
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
just destroy it.

268
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Why do you have to burn the house at the same time?

269
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
It's our attention.

270
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Say something, Wei Zhe.

271
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
If this is to get our attention,

272
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Isn't this a deliberate provocation?

273
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
If this is to provoke,

274
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
I think your idea is very interesting.

275
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
If a suspect

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
does something that makes people think it's not right,

277
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
then why do you think

278
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
people think he wants to cover up something?

279
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Why do you think he is provoking

280
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
you?

281
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Because you admit that Dong Xian

282
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
is the murderer of Zhou Junhao.

283
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
But to some extent, Dong Xian is also the victim.

284
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
If someone takes the right step,

285
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
and puts the knife of revenge in the hands of the victims,

286
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
and gives them the chance to take the knife back.

287
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
After all, those so-called righteous emissaries,

288
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
those murderers in their eyes,

289
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
are just a group of perverts with different genes.

290
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
As long as you can get rid of them,

291
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
it's worth it.

292
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Did you investigate the courier?

293
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
After Dong Xian's accident,

294
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
the courier disappeared.

295
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
The information he left at the courier company

296
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
is fake.

297
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Haoze, Xiaoqiao,

298
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
according to the information on the fake identity

299
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
and the photos of the suspect,

300
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
go find this mysterious courier.

301
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Xiao Wu, take Yang Xi to investigate the surveillance near Dong Liao's house

302
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
and track the movement of the accomplice.

303
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
When that person left the scene,

304
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
he may have left in disguise.

305
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Pay attention to his appearance.

306
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Pei Su, come with me.

307
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
That's all for today.

308
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
See you.

309
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Let's go.

310
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Captain Luo.

311
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I want to talk to you.

312
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Xiao Han's words may not mean that.

313
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
He is a coward who likes to go to the bathroom.

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
He is not a coward.

315
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
When he came up from the west,

316
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
he said at the scene that throwing away the body doesn't mean that he is a coward.

317
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I also thought that

318
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
he was a careless coward.

319
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
But now, if you think about it,

320
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
what he said,

321
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
it sounded like there was a problem in the west.

322
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
What did you mean by that?

323
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Didn't you get it?

324
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I remember. How could he

325
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
make a time difference?

326
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
It was just after Yang Xi and I left,

327
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
we were able to complete the delivery.

328
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
A time difference?

329
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
How could he make a time difference?

330
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,280
The person who sent the letter was so strong

331
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
that he could send the item after the first inspection.

332
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
He was clearly hinting at us.

333
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
There was a problem in the special investigation team.

334
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Also,

335
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
his overall opinion of this case,

336
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
in the absence of facts,

337
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
his guess is that someone wanted to be the envoy of justice

338
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
and openly provoked him.

339
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
In the absence of any evidence,

340
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
which normal person would think that?

341
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
I mean the normal person.

342
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
But the guess about Xiao Han Yang,

343
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
don't you think it sounds like

344
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
a clean-cut person?

345
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Tao Zi,

346
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
I don't object to Xiao Han Yang's conclusion.

347
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
On the contrary,

348
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
his guess has a certain possibility.

349
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Then you...

350
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I object to him telling everyone about this guess

351
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
in the absence of any evidence.

352
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
And he's not a spy.

353
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Moreover, he's not a spy.

354
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
I don't believe that Xiao Han Yang

355
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
has this guess for no reason.

356
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
I think

357
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
he must know something

358
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
that we don't know.

359
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
I even started to suspect

360
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
that he's a spy.

361
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Is he also trying to do something else?

362
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Also,

363
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
who else?

364
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
You...

365
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
You...

366
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
The detective is really full of energy.

367
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
He's done so many big cases

368
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
when he was young.

369
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Many people won't be able to catch up in their lifetime.

370
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Let's go.

371
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Let's go.

372
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Check the report in person.

373
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Where's the rice?

374
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Yang Bo has Huai Xing's water.

375
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Let's go.

376
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Mr. Zhou,

377
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
I have to remind you

378
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
that according to the new genetic test,

379
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Zhou Qun Hao is not a leader.

380
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
You're not.

381
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Huai Xing is not.

382
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
So,

383
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I've been living in a ridiculous lie.

384
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Only you can decide

385
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
what kind of person you are.

386
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
You're the only one.

387
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Mr. Zhou,

388
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
you've already made your decision,

389
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
haven't you?

390
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Huai Xing is not in a good mood.

391
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
He shouldn't be far away yet.

392
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Don't let him see you sad.

393
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
I've told you

394
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
everything I could.

395
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
What else do you want to know?

396
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Do you want to know

397
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
who the fake gangsters are?

398
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I've already told you

399
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
all the details.

400
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Mr. Zhou,

401
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
there's one thing you don't know.

402
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
The murderer who killed your brother, Dong Xiao Qing,

403
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
was hit by a car

404
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
after he ran away from the hospital.

405
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Really?

406
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
That's too cheap.

407
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
The person who hit him

408
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
was Xu Yan.

409
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
If I can do it,

410
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I really hope I can do it.

411
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Mr. Zhou,

412
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
why did Dong Xiao Qing

413
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
get killed

414
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
right after the case was over?

415
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
It's obvious.

416
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Someone was afraid that he would be arrested

417
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
and say something.

418
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
He's a murderer, but he's just a knife.

419
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Don't you want to know

420
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
who the fake gangsters are?

421
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
No matter how much Dong Xiao Qing is dead,

422
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
no matter how much you hate him,

423
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
no matter how much you want to cut him off,

424
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
he can't feel it now.

425
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Are you willing to do it?

426
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
What do you want to ask?

427
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
I asked you before.

428
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
You haven't answered.

429
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Why didn't you ask Dong Xiao Qing

430
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
why he attacked you?

431
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Do you know anything?

432
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Do you know Dong Xiao Qing?

433
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I don't know.

434
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
I've never seen him.

435
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
At least when he was getting close,

436
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
if I suspected something, I wouldn't let the bodyguard come over.

437
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Then what did you want to do?

438
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
I did do some

439
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
unrighteous things.

440
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
But in this case,

441
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Huai Xing is innocent.

442
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
If you can give him a fair explanation,

443
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
and let Zhou Shi get away with it,

444
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
or if he doesn't know anything, I don't care.

445
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
You all know

446
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Zhou Shi's public welfare fund

447
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
was involved in the blackmail.

448
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Zhou Dalong and Zheng Kaifeng

449
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
are the most clean-cut entrepreneurs

450
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
in this land

451
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
that no one knows about.

452
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
The most generous and kind-hearted.

453
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
But I know

454
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
they are not some kind of good-for-nothings.

455
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Zhou Shi's ship

456
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
was the first to be opened

457
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
by someone else's blood.

458
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
You mean Zhu Jun Hao

459
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
was the one who killed Zhou Ya Hou?

460
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Not only that,

461
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
the one who killed

462
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
and the one who was killed was Hao.

463
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Zhou Shi came here with the people.

464
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
He worked hard for so many years

465
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
and achieved great things.

466
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Many things can't be traced back to the past.

467
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I only remembered it after

468
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Dong Xiaoqing killed him.

469
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Many years ago,

470
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
my life had a conflict with him.

471
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I was worried

472
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
that it was related to Zheng Kaifeng.

473
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
What's the matter?

474
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
What are you looking for, Yan?

475
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
What's the matter?

476
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
It's been over 20 years.

477
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Huai Xing was born not long ago.

478
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
My mother's pregnancy is getting worse.

479
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I can't even get her to cry.

480
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
I moved her baby to my room

481
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
so that she could follow me every day.

482
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
I heard that a baby who cries

483
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
every night

484
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
will make the parents of Xin Xin

485
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
feel bad for years.

486
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Yan,

487
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
you've been very patient since you were a child.

488
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,280
Do you even remember

489
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
a babysitter?

490
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
There are a few teenagers in the world

491
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,280
who truly like babies.

492
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
I'm just afraid.

493
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
I can live under the cover of Zhou Junhao

494
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
and depend on my mother's protection.

495
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
But at that time,

496
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
whether it was her mental state or her physical state,

497
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
it was not easy for her.

498
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
It made me very desperate.

499
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
I saw her every day

500
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
as if I saw

501
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
my destiny.

502
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Huai Xing was the life-saving weapon

503
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
that I was holding.

504
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
I was very hard on her.

505
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Sometimes,

506
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,280
I even crushed my food

507
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
with a spoon to feed her.

508
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
I think Zhou Junhao, no matter what he wants to do,

509
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
will take care of his own child.

510
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
That night,

512
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
you don't have to go to Huai Xing's hospital.

513
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
She's dead. Don't worry.

514
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
I was afraid that they would attack me.

515
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
You were very sensitive.

516
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
There was no trace of her.

517
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
The big fish in the port of Xinzhou

518
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
was caught in our net.

519
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
I think there was a problem with the news.

520
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
You mean Dong?

521
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
He's a fool.

522
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
He knows nothing.

523
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
He's not lucky enough

524
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
to get caught.

525
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
That's right.

526
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
It's not like we don't spend money.

527
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
You're right.

528
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Boss,

529
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
can you give me a time to think?

530
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
When did this happen?

531
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
It's been many years.

532
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Learning to raise a child in the daytime

533
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,280
is not enough for an adult.

534
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Boss Zhou, you should be in school.

535
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Did he affect you?

536
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Are you free in class?

537
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm fine.

538
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
My class is not that important.

539
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
It's just a basic class in the daytime.

540
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Oh, right. It's middle school.

541
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
I was in the first year of middle school.

542
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
That's 20 years ago.

543
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
What season was it?

544
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Zheng Kaifeng wore a white coat.

545
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
It was either September or October.

546
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Captain Luo, there's a new discovery.

547
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Zhu Junhao died on September 16.

548
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
And this day

549
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
was the first day

550
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Dong sent a courier.

551
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
It was also the day

552
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Dong Xiaoqing's mother had a car accident.

553
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Look at this.

554
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
That's the day.

555
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
After I arrived in Xinzhou,

556
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
I secretly found someone to investigate

557
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
the news of Dong Xian's accident.

558
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
You were investigating

559
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,280
a well-known entrepreneur

560
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
who said he had died.

561
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Yes.

562
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Three months later,

563
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
he founded a shipping company

564
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
and was acquired by Jingwai Fund.

565
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,280
The source of Jingwai Fund

566
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
was a guest

567
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
registered by Zhou's

568
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
in the Faman Islands.

569
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Look.

570
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
People like them

571
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
are just

572
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,280
a small ant in their eyes.

573
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
As long as they can achieve their goal,

574
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
it doesn't matter how many people they kill.

575
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
After killing Zhou,

576
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
the two leaders of the two companies

577
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
became businessmen.

578
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
They successfully entered the upper class.

579
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
When they killed Lan Lu,

580
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
they were the people and resources

581
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
he had accumulated in Xinjiang and Chuan Gang.

582
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
They had at least ten years of development advantage.

583
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Mr. Pei, you know

584
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
how much it costs

585
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
to sell people and compete with local brands

586
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
in a strange place.

587
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
I just found out that

588
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
every driver who wanted to die

589
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
would have to pay a lot of money.

590
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Lin Ze is really

591
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
a man who plays chess before he gets to play.

592
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
That woman

593
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
walked over

594
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
and said something when she was moving.

595
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Only Huai Xing and I heard it.

596
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
What did she say?

597
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
She said...

598
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
You're not old enough.

599
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Why don't you let go of my father?

600
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
She thought you were a traitor.

601
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,280
She thought

602
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I used the Zhao's driver

603
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
to make Zhou Junhao's car accident

604
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
using Zhao's driver

605
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
which is her father's revenge.

606
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
That package

607
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
was the only thing

608
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
that could be used.

609
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
No.

610
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
The driver of Dongxian

611
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
called and found

612
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
a rule

613
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
that Dongxian used to put money in the bank.

614
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
There's a contract

615
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
for foreign investment.

616
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
It says

617
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
after Dongxian died,

618
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
a sum of money will be transferred

619
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
from an air company in the country

620
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
to the woman's hand.

621
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Take a look at the contract.

622
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
It's written in your name.

623
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
This is not me.

624
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I don't have that much power.

625
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
You can make a note of it.

626
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
One double-double.

627
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
But in the end,

628
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
there's still a lot of money.

629
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
The contract is from the same company.

630
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
This is the opening of the new market

631
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
20 years ago.

632
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
The company he founded

633
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
was the market.

634
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
It's Zheng Kaifeng.

635
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
Hello?

636
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Miss, Zheng Kaifeng ran away.

637
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
What?

638
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Let's go.

639
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Boss, Zheng Kaifeng ran away.

640
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Mr. Su, when did he disappear?

641
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
This morning.

642
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
We were at the Zhou's Building.

643
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
We followed him for a day.

644
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
We saw him in the parking lot

645
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
and followed him to the villa.

646
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
We heard him asking for help.

647
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
We stopped him.

648
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
But he wasn't the old man.

649
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
He was taken away?

650
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Sorry, boss.

651
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
But he ran away.

652
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Take all your colleagues back.

653
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Take you to Zhou's.

654
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Check the surveillance.

655
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Check the house and the bank accounts.

656
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Yes, sir.

657
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Xiao, ask for help.

658
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Send a notice to the airport

659
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
and the train station.

660
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Don't let him leave the new Zhou.

661
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Yes, sir.

662
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Come with me.

663
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Yunsu, did you see Zhou?

664
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Yes, sir.

665
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Everyone, go back.

666
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Yes, sir.

667
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Go back.

668
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Dear audience,

669
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
it's 22 o'clock in the new Zhou.

670
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Welcome to Mingde's radio.

671
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm the host, Xiao Jing.

672
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
It's late at night.

673
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
The train is running late.

674
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
The train is running late.

675
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
It seems that my car doesn't have a hearing aid.

676
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
I change cars every day.

677
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I can't even talk.

678
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Maybe I'm too cautious.

679
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,280
There's a hearing aid

680
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
in the special investigation team.

681
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
It's a big deal.

682
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
But this time,

683
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Zheng Kaifeng escaped

684
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
and it's too subtle.

685
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
But to be honest,

686
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
shouldn't you take my car?

687
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
From every angle,

688
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm the one who seems to have a problem.

689
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
First, I know Zheng Kaifeng.

690
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
I'm familiar with Zhou's family more than anyone.

691
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Second,

692
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
everything happened after I came.

693
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
According to the normal logic,

694
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
based on the analysis of historical records,

695
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Yang Xi is the most suspicious person.

696
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,280
According to your reason,

697
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Yang Xi is suspicious too.

698
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
No, Yang Xi has nothing to do with Zhou's family.

699
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Besides, she's the same age as Yang.

700
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
She shouldn't be

701
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,280
as close as Zheng Kaifeng.

702
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Don't worry.

703
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
In this matter,

704
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I've never doubted her

705
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
or you.

706
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Actually, before Dong Xiaoqing's death,

707
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,280
she told me

708
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
that Dong Xian is not innocent.

709
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
She's one of those people.

710
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
I'm wondering

711
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,280
who those people are talking about.

712
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Twenty years ago, a truck driver

713
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
was bribed

714
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
to meet Yang Qing, a famous entrepreneur.

715
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
He accidentally killed his mother.

716
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Twenty years later,

717
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
his father became the driver

718
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
of that truck.

719
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,280
You mean,

720
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
there's a gang of people who are good at

721
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
killing people and killing trucks.

722
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
They even sacrifice themselves

723
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
like they're assassins.

724
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
It's a bit suspicious.

725
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,280
But that's the only way

726
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,280
to explain things.

727
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
I didn't say this before.

728
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Because I don't understand

729
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
what Dong Xiaoqing means.

730
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm afraid of disturbing your judgment.

731
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
That's right.

732
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,280
I asked some friends

733
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,280
to check Yang's background.

734
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
His father died

735
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
ten years ago.

736
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
He hit a car in the middle of the road.

737
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Both died.

738
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Who was the victim?

739
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
What does it have to do with Zhou Shi?

740
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
This is the most suspicious place.

741
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
They hit a car

742
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
with seven commercial cars.

743
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
The cars were all white cars

744
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
of a real estate company.

745
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
The day after the accident,

746
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
they planned to send a company

747
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
to participate in a campaign.

748
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,280
And the garage wasn't in Xingzhou.

749
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,280
Zhou Shi didn't participate in the campaign.

750
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
So no matter how you look at it,

751
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Zhou Shi has nothing to do with the victims.

752
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Who took the campaign

753
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
in the end?

754
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Later, the company gave up the campaign.

755
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
The project was taken away

756
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
by a small company.

757
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,280
You don't know the name.

758
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
But

759
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
I can provide you

760
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,280
with another effective message.

761
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
Mr. Tan Yuan,

762
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
although it may be a little later,

763
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
what you can find

764
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
and I can find it.

765
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
But

766
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm willing to give you

767
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,280
a chance to show your support.

768
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,280
Say it.

769
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I checked the company's account.

770
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
I found that it has a large amount of debt.

771
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
If you can't pay it back in time,

772
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
the company's equity

773
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
will be returned to you immediately.

774
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
Simply speaking,

775
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
this company has a hidden shareholder.

776
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
And the name of this shareholder

777
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
is the Light Foundation.

778
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Light Foundation

779
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280

780
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
