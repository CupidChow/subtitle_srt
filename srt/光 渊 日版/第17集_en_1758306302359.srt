1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,520
Come on, breakfast is made at home. Thank you, brother. Come on, eat it

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Let me see

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
It's so delicious

8
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Thank you, brother. You're welcome

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
You're welcome

10
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Thank you, brother

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Another one

12
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Go, go, go

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
You think that's me

14
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
It's almost a month before the baby is born. The baby's breakfast is definitely made for his wife

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
Brother

16
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
We're going to have breakfast

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
We'll talk about it later, Xiaobo. I'll give you a holiday

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Thank you, Tao Feng

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Come on, Tao Feng. Thank you

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
This is really small

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Tao Feng

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Here you go

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Thank you

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Boss

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
What's wrong?

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
There's a new client. It's a big case

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
It's a big case

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
It's a big case

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Mr. Pei, I've got the name list

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Those who graduated from political science with Pan Yiheng Du

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Except for Zhang Zu and Yang Zhengfeng

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,600
There are 27 people who are in the other relevant professions

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Have you ever entered the SID system?

34
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Seven

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Has anyone left the SID system ten years ago?

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
There is one

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
And there's very little information

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
I think you can focus on it

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Mr. Pei

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Actually, the person you're looking for

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
I think Luo Weizhao must have more detailed information than me

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Send me the information you found first

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Okay

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Okay

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Please come in

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Mr. Pan

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Pei Su

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Why did you leave the hospital so soon?

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
No need for post-op treatment

50
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
It's no use living in the hospital

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
And it's uncomfortable

52
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
It's better to come back and take care of yourself

53
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm sorry

54
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm sorry

55
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm sorry

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm sorry

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm sorry

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm sorry

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm sorry

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm sorry

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm sorry

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm sorry

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
I'm sorry

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm sorry

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm sorry

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's better to come back and take care of yourself

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Actually, I'm afraid that I'll lie down and go over it as soon as I study

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
What if you make me stay in a hurry?

69
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You too

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It's okay to meet danger when you're a first-tier scout

71
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
But I heard for the first time

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,600
A student who is responsible for organizing the files also got into this kind of thing

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
It's a coincidence

74
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
The SID team didn't have enough cars

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I'll borrow their car

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
But I heard that the inspection written by the SID team is ready to be published

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
This is a result

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Teacher

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Have you read my thesis?

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Why do you want to write this topic?

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
The cause and effect of the source

82
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
This is a very controversial topic

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I know there are many theories about the direction of this topic

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
But what I want to discuss this time is

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
The inevitable relationship between the crime and the victims

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Do you remember Zhou Hongchuan in the murder case in the West District?

87
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
And Su Lingnai, a gang of girls who disappeared in a series of cases

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
And Zheng Kaifeng, a businessman disguised as Zhou in the case of Zhou

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Although they play their roles in society

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,600
But essentially they are all on the side of 1.3%

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
They can't relate to others

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
They can't understand others

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
But they can't integrate into society

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
So when they pick up the knife

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
They won't realize that they are committing crimes

96
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
And they won't realize that they are killing their peers

97
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
The crime and the victims are as simple as cleaning up the garbage

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
So I think the crime and the crime

99
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Can't get away from the group of victims

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
And from the current case

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
The relationship between the two is undoubtedly 100%

102
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I think this topic is very necessary to study

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
But the cases I can touch now are few

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
So teacher

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Can I apply to pick up some SID cases

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
And make a special topic in the Lingdu project?

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I'll think about it

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Teacher, I'll wait for your news

109
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Is that Yang Xi's father?

110
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I saw his photo in Lode before

111
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
He graduated from college

112
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
It's been almost 30 years

113
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
So there is this relationship

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
No wonder he will take your master's

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
He was always avoiding the test before

116
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
He didn't dare to come

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
A few months ago

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
He took the initiative to apply to be my master

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I didn't even react

120
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
What's wrong?

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
I saw this photo in the office of the group of victims

122
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
There were five people in it

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
The one who was kidnapped was Lao Yao

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
He passed away

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Manager Yang passed away too?

126
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Not the same

127
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
He took the wrong path

128
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
What path?

129
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
What path?

130
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
It's wrong

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
No matter what the mistake is

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
It's the same for the result

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Pei Su

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
It's easy to get into the mud

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
It's easy to get into the mud

136
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
It's hard to get out of the mud

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I understand, Teacher Pan

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
This is the big case you're talking about

139
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm sorry

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
So now

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
The students who are looking for the missing

142
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Is it also part of our SID work?

143
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Then our next focus

144
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Do you have to put it in whose house

145
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
What do you lose the little dog and cat?

146
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
What are you laughing at?

147
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I have to do those serial murders

148
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Good door, good yard

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
You are satisfied with working overtime every day, right?

150
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
How can there be such a good life?

151
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Why don't you cherish it?

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Yes, yes, yes

153
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I shouldn't laugh

154
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Don't be angry

155
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm sorry

156
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
It's not the same for a young man to leave his home and leave his child

157
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
The child's death is due to the urgency

158
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
And the severity of the malignant event

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Have all been brought into the SID investigation

160
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
But this time all the students who ran away are college students

161
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
18 to 19 years old

162
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Both men and women have

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
And they walked away on their own

164
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
There is no high probability of encountering any danger

165
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
What Luo just meant should be

166
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Such a standard case

167
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Unless a special situation

168
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Otherwise, it will not be entrusted to the special investigation team

169
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
This time it's a special situation

170
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
The students who ran away

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Are students from the second-class international college

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
This school is a high school

173
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Exceeds the administrative area

174
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
So I can only report to the SID

175
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
This is also part of our government service plan

176
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Tell me about the students who ran away

177
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
The five students who were in the operation

178
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Are students from the second-class international college

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Because the prison is closed

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Students are in school

181
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
So they ran from the school in the middle of the night

182
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
This is a letter posted online before the students ran away

183
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Many people posted it online

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Maybe they think that

185
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Students now can't get away from the Internet

186
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
What if I see it somewhere

187
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Will not be able to resist the reply of Xu Rongxi

188
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Then I can also save people at the first time

189
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Who is the person who wrote the letter

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
The one in the back

191
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
This Feng Bin has good family conditions

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
In school, the staff is also eaten

193
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
The grades are also high

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I don't know why I can't think of it

195
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
I made such a mess

196
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
All aspects are good

197
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
There are no features in the music industry

198
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Students who rarely take the lead

199
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Why would you suddenly take everyone

200
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Make such a big mess

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Young people don't know the taste of worry

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
For the sake of the father

203
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Forced to say worry

204
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
I want to go to college

205
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Busy in love every day

206
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Never have time to do this kind of thing

207
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
It's hard for teachers and parents

208
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Excellent life

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
The experience is always similar

210
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Think back to the year

211
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Brother is a political law

212
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
A grass

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
I am a political law

214
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
A grass

215
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I am still a political law, a flower

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Political law college

217
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
In total, less than ten girls

218
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You are not a political law, a flower

219
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
How is it

220
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Enough

221
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
It's just a little bit of a show

222
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Don't be poor

223
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Go check it out

224
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Bus station, airport, long-distance bus station

225
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Haven't found anyone for three days

226
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Not normal

227
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes Yes

228
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Let's go eat hot pot

229
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Good

230
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Eat hot pot

231
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Have some vegetables

232
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Tao Fu, don't you have a situation

233
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Why are you so not excited after work

234
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Is it not successful

235
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Continue to work hard

236
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Come on

237
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Starts to get excited again

238
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Go go go

239
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Bye Tao Fu

240
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Bye bye

241
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Brother

242
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Brother

243
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Brother

244
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
SID

245
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
The situation is more complicated now

246
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
The team transferred the 11 students to the first line

247
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Also to protect

248
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Don't feel burdened

249
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I'm not here for this

250
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Brother

251
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I want to ask for leave

252
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Ask for leave

253
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
OK, I have no problem here

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Did you say hello to your teacher

255
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
OK, please stay a few days

256
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I'll give you a note later

257
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Maybe a few days

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Maybe a few months

259
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I have to sort out the situation before I can go

260
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Did something happen

261
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I'm sorry

262
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Lao Lu

263
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Here

264
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
What is this

265
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Pork

266
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I made it with pork

267
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
For you

268
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Your mother gives me seafood every year

269
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
How do you want to send pork this year

270
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
My teacher gave it to her

271
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
She doesn't like us

272
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
It's not sticky now

273
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
She didn't give you any

274
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
My teacher asked me to go

275
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
What

276
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Teacher

277
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Last month, she just got married

278
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
I found out

279
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Lin Bai

280
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Can you still see it

281
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
It's dark

282
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
It's not long

283
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
No

284
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
What about Xi Xi

285
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
She hasn't graduated yet

286
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I'll go and see

287
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Lao Lu

288
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
It's too late today

289
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
You go home first

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Don't disturb her

291
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Teacher Pan is there

292
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
The school will not be difficult for her

293
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Moreover

294
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
You are not a person

295
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
She may not be happy even if you go

296
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
You go home first

297
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Go home and rest early

298
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm leaving

299
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Tao Ze

300
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Did the teacher get sick because of Lao Yang

301
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
He has been depressed all the time

302
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I'm going in

303
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Hide quickly

304
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Let's play hide and seek

305
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Go

306
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Jia Hui

307
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Write this letter in case

308
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
You are not happy

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm going to go

310
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Go

311
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Go

312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Go

313
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Go

314
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Go

315
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Go

316
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Go

317
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Go

318
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Go

319
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Go

320
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
In case one day I die by accident

321
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
And you find out what I left

322
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I hope it won't bring you and Xi Xi danger

323
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
In this business

324
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
No one wants to bring danger to their families

325
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
But

326
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I have no one to entrust

327
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
After handling my funeral

328
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
But

329
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
You remember not to contact my old friends

330
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I suspect

331
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Some people have changed

332
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I don't know who that person is

333
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
You must be careful

334
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Wei Zhao and Tao Ze, they are children

335
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Have a good heart

336
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Ability to be a family

337
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Don't involve them

338
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Don't be too close to them

339
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,600
In case the young people are too heavy

340
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
And make a dangerous sacrifice

341
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I don't know who our enemies are

342
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
And how long they have existed

343
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
They are the spiritual conquerors hidden in this society

344
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
They have a huge organization

345
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Huge wealth

346
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Already share the same body with Xinzhou

347
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
But they are not satisfied

348
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
And they do everything

349
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
In addition to the law

350
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I suspect these people are related to the murder of Duo Qi

351
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Even

352
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
The murderer of Huanyang Tong Qi Fan

353
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I have been working for more than 20 years

354
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
In theory

355
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I should withdraw from the first line

356
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I should retire in peace

357
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
And let Xi Xi graduate

358
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
And retire in the city

359
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
To live a long life

360
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
But

361
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
I can't

362
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Please forgive me

363
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Jiahui

364
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I can never touch the dead people of 327 Gan

365
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
This world is too complicated

366
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Human nature is too complicated

367
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Many things are buried under the ground for a long time

368
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Like an unreachable dust

369
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
But time is like a constant storm

370
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Huo Xiao has been shot

371
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Jiahui

372
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Do you remember Huo Xiao?

373
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
My good friend and good brother

374
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Now no one dares to mention him

375
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
He became a glorious doctor

376
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Huo Xiao

377
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
All the grudges will be defeated one day

378
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
If I am not there at that time

379
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Please watch that day for me

380
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Give these things to those who have the ability to continue to investigate

381
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Otherwise

382
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
I will not die

383
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Jiahui

384
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Jiahui

385
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Brother Ping, do you hate it?

386
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
What's wrong?

387
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I came out to get a cup of hot water

388
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Do you want it?

389
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
I want to drink it

390
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I want to drink it

391
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
I want to drink it

392
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I want to drink it

393
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Do you want it?

394
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I'll get it for you

395
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Actually I live here

396
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
You are not convenient

397
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,600
It seems that the sincerity that brother wants is destined to be a fantasy

398
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Thank you

399
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
But what I want is hot water

400
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
What do you mean?

401
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
You didn't kill it, did you?

402
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I didn't

403
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Then why did you send me here?

404
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Cat sand, cat climb, cat can

405
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
I will pay for it

406
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
So

407
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Can you raise it?

408
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
No

409
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
I will not

410
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I will not

411
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Can you raise it?

412
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
No

413
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
You, you just raise it

414
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
It will be very good for you

415
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Then why don't you raise it yourself?

416
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Pei Su

417
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
You are fifteen years old

418
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Not five years old

419
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Since you planned to adopt it

420
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
You should be responsible for its life

421
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
You can't like it yesterday

422
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
You don't like it today

423
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
You can just abandon it

424
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Why did you suddenly leave my house?

425
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I will go to the bathroom

426
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I got some new clues

427
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
It's about the real cause of Lao Yang's death

428
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Because there are too many people involved in it

429
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
So the less people know, the better

430
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
It has something to do with you

431
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I haven't figured out many things yet

432
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
I don't know if I can tell you

433
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Or tell you how many

434
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Give me a few more days

435
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm so tired

436
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Do you think it's okay?

437
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Okay

438
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Lao Luo, something happened

439
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
I'm in a hurry

440
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
I'll send you the address

441
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Come here quickly

442
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Five students who died in the case of Yu Fen yesterday

443
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
One of them died last night

444
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
The killer broke the victim's eye

445
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Where?

446
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Ye Langgu

447
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Morning

448
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Morning

449
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Morning

450
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Morning

451
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Morning

452
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Morning

453
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Morning

454
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Good morning

455
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Morning

456
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
It's laughter everywhere

457
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,600
No longer seen under the cover of laughter

458
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
No tears for the world

459
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
What you just heard

460
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,280
Is the title of the first product of the

461
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Thank you for listening

462
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
Restore the data of the mobile phone

463
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Then look for the area around here

464
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Can you find the murder?

465
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Okay

466
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Then analyze the blood

467
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Okay

468
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Captain Luo

469
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Is the victim really confirmed?

470
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Confirmed

471
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
The victim's name is Feng Bing

472
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
The letter left to the teacher's parents on the Internet

473
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
It was written by him

474
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
When the cleaner cleaned the body in the morning

475
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
He found his body and reported the case

476
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Where is the fatal wound?

477
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
The fatal wound is in the abdomen

478
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
But there are obvious resistance wounds on the hands and heads

479
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
It should be caused by fighting with the killer in the face

480
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
There are obvious bruises on the eyeballs

481
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
What about the time of death?

482
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Between 22 and 23 o'clock in the evening

483
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Did you find the murder?

484
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
No murder was found at the scene

485
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
But fatal wounds and other stab wounds

486
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Are all knife wounds

487
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Only the wounds on the eyeballs are not

488
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
The forensic doctor initially identified

489
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
It's a kind of like a steel chase weapon

490
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
We initially inferred

491
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
It should be a specific criminal expression

492
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Stab eyes

493
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I seem to have heard of it somewhere

494
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Captain Luo

495
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Captain, have you heard of the 327 serial robbery murder case?

496
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
It was a case of the same case ten years ago

497
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
The murderer may have trusted some folk superstition

498
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Think the dead people will leave on the Internet

499
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
The final impression he saw before his life

500
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
So the eyes of the victim were broken

501
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
The main suspect of the case that year

502
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Du Guosheng is still running

503
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Will this case have anything to do with him?

504
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Du Guosheng

505
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Correct

506
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Du Guosheng

507
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
A serial killer with a cognitive disability

508
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
According to the testimony of his accomplices

509
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
In their minds

510
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
There will be another voice

511
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Let them kill people

512
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
This is all ten years ago

513
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
You remember better than me

514
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
How old were you then?

515
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I saw it on the Internet

516
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Memory is better

517
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Your memory is not good

518
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
It should be forgotten

519
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
In school

520
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
The academic performance is good

521
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
How can't think so

522
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Come to SID

523
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Our salary is so low

524
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I

525
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
My dream since childhood is to enter SID

526
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Is it also to save the world?

527
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Is this the murderer's footprint?

528
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Yes

529
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
We initially determined that it was the murderer's footprint

530
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
SID has taken it back to analyze

531
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
When you came

532
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Did you open the garbage bin?

533
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Yes, the SID did not finish the inspection

534
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
We didn't move the scene

535
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
We are here according to blood

536
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
It should be that Feng Bin stayed here

537
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Stuck on the floor and stayed

538
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Stay here

539
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Correct

540
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
We are still restoring the scene according to blood

541
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
But initial judgment

542
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
It should be that Feng Bin stayed here for a short time

543
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
When he left

544
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
The murderer killed him outside the house

545
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Is there any important evidence in this house?

546
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
In addition to the footprints on the scene

547
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
We also found two more important evidence

548
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
One is Feng Bin's phone

549
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Has been broken down

550
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
The witness group is recovering

551
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Another one is a pink hairband left here

552
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Bloodstain on it

553
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Hairband

554
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
It's the number ten witness

555
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Our initial guess

556
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
It's from another victim

557
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Wait

558
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Another victim?

559
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Yes

560
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
In addition to the dead Feng Bin

561
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
There is another victim

562
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Called Xia Xinnan

563
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
She is one of the girls who escaped with Feng Bin

564
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Where is she?

565
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
At the ambulance

566
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Tell the witness group

567
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
I need a complete behavioral track record

568
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Yes

569
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Boss

570
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Don't go there yet

571
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
What's wrong?

572
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Although the student is not injured

573
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I don't know if it was caught

574
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
It was scared all night

575
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
As soon as someone approached, they screamed

576
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
We are waiting for the parents

577
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Now I can't ask anything

578
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
I can only ask the doctor

579
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Where was she when you arrived this morning?

580
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
When the cleaner in the southwest

581
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Found in the trash can on the other street

582
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
We are now preliminary judgment

583
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
It was when two people met the murderer

584
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
The murderer was the victim

585
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
The murderer was the victim

586
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
The murderer was the victim

587
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
The murderer was the victim

588
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
The murderer was the victim

589
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
We are now preliminary judgment

590
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
It was when two people met the murderer

591
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Feng Bin stopped the murderer to protect her

592
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Let the girl go first

593
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
After the girl escaped the crime scene

594
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Found a trash can and hid

595
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Feng Bin was killed last night

596
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Since she is fine

597
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Why didn't the bodyguard report the case?

598
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I think it was really scared

599
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
And when we found her

600
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Xia Xinnan had no hands

601
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I didn't expect to find them for three or four days

602
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Finally, I let the bad guys find her first

603
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Transfer the surveillance

604
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
The tourist area here is not so private

605
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
The murderer can't be hidden

606
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Tell the brothers not to be idle

607
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Go around the supermarket and restaurant to ask

608
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
A few bear children are out

609
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
It's impossible not to eat and drink

610
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Someone must have seen them

611
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Yes

612
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Old man, you can't go

613
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Let me go

614
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I want to see my granddaughter

615
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Old man

616
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Are you okay?

617
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Are you okay?

618
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Get up, get up

619
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Xia Xinnan

620
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Why did you come out when you saw this?

621
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
Xiaonan

622
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Are you okay?

623
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
My granddaughter

624
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Xiaonan

625
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Xiaonan

626
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Xiaonan

627
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:48,800
How many times have I been called to the line of the

628
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,600
How many times have I been called to the line of the

629
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,600
The dust is still calling me

630
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Blossom and bury it back in the light

631
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,600
No more face to face

632
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Crying and daring to come back to the color of the dream

633
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:21,600
No matter right or wrong, I am not a white

634
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Just go forward

635
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,600
The wound is only a little bit

636
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
The wind in the dark is me

637
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Keep going

638
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,600
The wind is only a little bit

639
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
The wind in the dark is me

640
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Keep going

641
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
The wind in the dark is me

642
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Keep going

643
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,600
The wind in the dark is me

644
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Keep going

645
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,600
The wind in the dark is me
