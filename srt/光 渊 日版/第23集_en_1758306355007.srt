1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What

8
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just went in

9
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't want to wait anymore. I'm going in

10
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going too

11
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Du Guosheng is alive to be interrogated

12
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Your brother has the opportunity to take the blame

13
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Otherwise, there is no point in having another person like you in the prison

14
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Understand?

15
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Go into the village quietly

16
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't shoot

17
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Pei, please support the factory

18
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have a very high exit fee

19
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you doing?

20
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm feeding the cat for a day, and I'm using the cat for a while

21
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to help me complete the work for your brother

22
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Be careful

23
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The right to lose the family

24
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Eat

25
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Maybe it's your last meal

26
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm going to eat

27
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Brother, it's about 50 meters in the direction of 3 o'clock

28
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you afraid that I will poison your food?

29
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And then throw your corpse out

30
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't be afraid

31
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Although the last person died like this

32
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I won't do this to you

33
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Stop the power

34
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Stop the power

35
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're going to be in trouble

36
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Stop the power

37
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's dark, the mouse is out

38
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's catch the mouse first

39
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mr. Pei's order

40
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Brother, follow the official's footsteps

41
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll go to the village

42
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Brother, follow the official's footsteps

43
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Old Du, turn right and go to the west

44
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Old Du, there are people in the back of the house

45
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Brother, there is a gun in front of you, do you want to go to the road?

46
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't move, it's slower than him

47
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How many people can I kill if I'm slow?

48
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are better than me, Brother

49
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm not afraid of people

50
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not afraid of people

51
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Brother

52
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Brother

53
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Call the police

54
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Can you hear me?

55
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Brother

56
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Brother

57
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Brother

58
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The police are coming

59
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's 2 to 1

60
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Now it's 2 to 1

61
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wrong

62
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's 2 to 2

63
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We're here, you don't need to go to the rest

64
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just wait for the police

65
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Be careful

66
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Brother

67
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Brother

68
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Brother

69
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Brother

70
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I got the trick

71
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I won

72
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll go get you

73
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Brother

74
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Brother

75
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There is a dog in the middle

76
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He is watching the training

77
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He has found us

78
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think he will report to the organization

79
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm afraid they will act immediately

80
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Got it

81
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You watch the dog

82
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll be right out

83
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OK

84
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hello

85
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The base found a drone

86
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We were watched

87
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Impossible

88
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How did they get there?

89
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That driver doesn't know anything

90
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The base is exposed on the 13th

91
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Please destroy it

92
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Do it now

93
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Roger

94
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do it now

95
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Master

96
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Master

97
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Master

98
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not dead

99
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I can understand people

100
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nice skills

101
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Looks a little stronger than you

102
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was a special forces soldier before

103
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's hard to say

104
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Master

105
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Chief, I found a bomb

106
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What happened?

107
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The bomb is still in the building

108
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's still a machine-gun

109
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Someone set up a bomb

110
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Bomb

111
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where is the bomb?

112
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think it's under the civilian house

113
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If we want to clear this place

114
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The best way is to bury it in a place that is exposed

115
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That warehouse

116
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A few minutes left

117
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I can't talk

118
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll go find it

119
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What are you doing?

120
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Find the bomb

121
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Never go

122
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's too dangerous

123
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't be impulsive

124
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Listen to me

125
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Senior

126
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What are you doing here?

127
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who are you?

128
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why do you care about them?

129
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They will die anyway

130
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Do you want to die?

131
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Senior

132
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Senior, I have a certificate

133
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Some people don't know whether they will die or not

134
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's not up to us

135
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Even if they should die

136
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They have to be punished by law

137
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And if people like them die here

138
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The victims like you

139
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Will never know the truth

140
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But you

141
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Stop talking nonsense

142
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Du Guosheng is really important

143
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We have to save the lives

144
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Take them away

145
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Find Pei Su

146
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let him keep an eye on Mu Yangquan

147
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's up to you

148
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Captain Guo

149
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Aren't you afraid that I will take the risk?

150
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I believe in every soldier on the battlefield

151
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The number you are calling is busy

152
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The number you are calling is busy

153
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There

154
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Stop

155
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't move

156
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Go

157
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The army will be here soon

158
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If you don't want to die, stand still

159
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There is no army

160
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Only him

161
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you don't want to die, go

162
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There is a bomb here

163
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Do you want to die?

164
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Go

165
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Go

166
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Go

167
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Go

168
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Don't listen to him

169
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's so hidden

170
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
How could there be a bomb?

171
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Go

172
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Kill him

173
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He is alone

174
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Go

175
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Go

176
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Come

177
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Go

178
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Go

179
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Go

180
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Go

181
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Go

182
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Go

183
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Go

184
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Go

185
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Go

186
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Go

187
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Go

188
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Go

189
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If people like them die here

190
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The victims like you

191
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Will never be able to wait for the next one

192
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Go

193
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Go

194
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Don't move

195
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't move

196
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't move

197
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Put down your knife

198
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't move

199
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Put down

200
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Put down

201
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't move

202
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Put down

203
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Put down

204
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
We just caught the criminal

205
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
There are eight people

206
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Including Du Guosheng

207
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Keep searching

208
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes

209
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There is a bomb

210
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Luo Weizhou is still inside

211
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's too late if you don't go

212
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Go and save them

213
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's too late if you don't go

214
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Go and save them

215
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Luo, should we call the defense team?

216
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Damn

217
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Old Qiu, it's me, Luo

218
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I have an urgent matter to talk to you

219
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Don't hang up

220
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll take a video for you

221
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
How is it? Did you receive it?

222
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What the hell is this?

223
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Where are you?

224
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's hard to tell

225
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Tell me how to take it apart

226
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You eat it, I'll do the operation

227
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Get out of the way

228
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Don't stop me

229
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Luo is still inside

230
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll go and save him

231
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The electric board is broken

232
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What should we do now?

233
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Is there a silver wire behind the electric board?

234
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yes

235
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Hurry up

236
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There are two

237
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Which one?

238
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Double insurance

239
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What should we do?

240
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What else can we do?

241
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You only have half the chance

242
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Luo Weizhou, I'm telling you

243
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You run quickly

244
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Weizhou

245
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Did you hear me?

246
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Weizhou

247
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Brother, thank you

248
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll treat you to dinner later

249
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What are you talking about?

250
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Let me go

251
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Let me go

252
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Pei Su

253
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Come back, Pei Su

254
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Come back

255
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Come back

256
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Luo Weizhou

257
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You

258
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Hurry up

259
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Hurry up

260
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hurry up

261
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Hurry up

262
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Hurry up

263
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hurry up

264
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Hurry up

265
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Hurry up

266
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Luo Weizhou

267
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You scared me, Luo

268
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Are you okay?

269
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Luo Weizhou

270
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Listen

271
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There are some suspicious people in Longyun Village

272
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They are related to the case

273
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Can you help us to get rid of them?

274
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Don't go

275
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It's okay

276
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Pei Su

277
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Are you okay?

278
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Pei Su

279
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Are you okay?

280
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
SID

281
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You're suspected to be behind the bars

282
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,020
Detective

283
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:02,020
Murder, queer, and destruction of họ buildings

284
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
and perpet 있습니다

285
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,360
We have arrested the NSA

286
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Take them away

287
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Yes

288
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Lets go

289
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,440
Go.

290
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Captain Luo, we've got them.

291
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,200
Who are they? What should we do now?

292
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,760
Captain Luo wants to catch him.

293
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I really don't know what Boss likes about you.

294
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It was winter at that time.

295
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
My family called and said that my brother had disappeared.

296
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I took a train home day and night.

297
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Boss,

298
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Boss,

300
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I received my brother's death letter.

301
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It was about me loving the people in the world.

302
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Those eyes,

303
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I will never forget them.

304
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then I returned from the army.

305
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I went to find him all over the world.

306
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But I didn't find anything.

307
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Then they found me.

308
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I thought about it for a night.

309
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They said, if I pretend to be your father,

310
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you can give me the poison.

311
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But you didn't agree.

312
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I want to confirm.

313
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Since my brother died,

314
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I've been trying to kill him.

315
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
God gave me two chances.

316
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
One was three years ago.

317
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And the other one was just now.

318
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm a coward.

319
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm a coward.

320
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's over. Today is a happy day.

321
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

322
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Old Tu,

323
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I wanted to tell you three years ago.

324
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You were a soldier.

325
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You were very respectful and law-abiding.

326
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Most importantly,

327
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
you're different from them.

328
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Just like you saved him today,

329
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
it's because you know that he's not only carrying your brother's life,

330
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
but also Feng Bin's, and the lives of the other two victims.

331
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
They're all waiting for him to accept the trial and admit his crimes

332
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and give their relatives an explanation.

333
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I hope I won't make this choice.

334
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You won't?

335
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Will he be tried?

336
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Will he be tried?

337
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Hey.

338
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What's going on?

339
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
What's going on?

340
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What's going on?

341
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
What's going on?

342
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
What's going on?

343
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What's going on?

344
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
What's going on?

345
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You don't know anything. Why are you helping me?

346
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm a suspect. I trust my colleagues.

347
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm a suspect.

348
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Good morning.

349
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Good morning.

350
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

351
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Otherwise, I would have been in trouble.

352
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Wait.

353
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Du Guosheng, male, 39 years old.

354
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
He's from Lianhua Mountain, Xinzhou. He's a graduate of Xinzhou University of Engineering.

355
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
He knows the person who caused the trouble.

356
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
He's not even close to the police. He has a brother named Du Guoxin.

357
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He was sentenced to death and executed ten years ago.

358
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Du Guosheng, a student of the International College of Law, Feng Bin,

359
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
was murdered in Yewanggu Police Station.

360
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You killed him?

361
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yes.

362
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Who told you to do it?

363
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The planner.

364
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Explain to me, planner.

365
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
He's the one who helped me plan the time and place.

366
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
What's the detail?

367
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Normally, VIPs are divided into 13 categories.

368
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Only the real customers will have the black card.

369
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The black card has no money, but the points.

370
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
They use the points to buy the records.

371
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The customers take the black card and find us.

372
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Then we plan and then we start.

373
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Have you seen Wei Wenxuan?

374
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I saw him when I went to Longyun City to meet Feng Bin.

375
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So he's the one who told you to kill Feng Bin and leave Xia Xinnan?

376
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Who?

377
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The girl with the phone's locator.

378
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The planner told me that it was our own.

379
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know where he got it.

380
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I was scared to pee.

381
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Was it funny?

382
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I was afraid of a mistake.

383
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So I took away the locator.

384
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Who's the planner?

385
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't know.

386
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The planner is Wei Shisan.

387
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
A Shisan?

388
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'll take the information from Feng Chao.

389
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Let him identify A Shisan.

390
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Why did you go to Longyun City on October 16?

391
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
A Shisan asked me to identify him.

392
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You're not afraid of being recognized or being photographed?

393
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's been ten years.

394
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Who else can recognize me?

395
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Besides, Wei family is the owner of Longyun City.

396
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
They can't take our surveillance footage.

397
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The surveillance footage has been deleted.

398
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
They only care about the relationship between Longyun City and them.

399
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The gate and surroundings are still a hot topic.

400
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What?

401
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Any leak?

402
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Sun Jiaxin, also known as Sun Xin,

403
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
often told you that you're Du Ling.

404
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You're a electrician.

405
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That's a lie.

406
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We're not like the workers.

407
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We're the ones who make money.

408
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
What's the money?

409
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
There are two types of work.

410
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
One is a job and the other is a job.

411
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The job is the suicide bomber you see in the news.

412
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
For example, we have a human-made car accident.

413
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It's a normal car accident.

414
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The job is more complicated.

415
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You have to find a famous person.

416
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
For example, I've been a job seeker for ten years.

417
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Every local person knows about the case.

418
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The second is to expose yourself.

419
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You're the one who made the employee come.

420
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Why?

421
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
To protect the client.

422
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You're the ones who find the person.

423
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
We have to see the headline in the newspaper.

424
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The person is a fugitive.

425
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The client is safe.

426
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Who are the clients?

427
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I don't know.

428
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
They're big bosses.

429
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
They won't contact us.

430
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Okay.

431
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Let's talk about something you know.

432
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You left a fingerprint ten years ago.

433
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Can we talk about this?

434
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I escaped from the case.

435
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I was lucky.

436
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
When I was in the hotel, there was a wall.

437
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
He called me as soon as I entered the room.

438
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I was so scared.

439
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
They found me.

440
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,700
The man in the

441
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,700
hotel.

442
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,700
I was sad.

443
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,700
I drank with the hotel.

444
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,400
I was drunk.

445
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,400
I almost got caught.

446
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,400
I found the place.

447
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,400
I was so scared.

448
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
I pushed everything to you.

449
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,400
I was so scared.

450
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,400
I'll help you remember.

451
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Ten years ago, there was a detective named Huo Xiao.

452
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,100
He was responsible for the case.

453
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,100
He didn't know about this.

454
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,100
He found a fingerprint in the scene.

455
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,100
He found the fingerprint.

456
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,100
He locked his eyes on the case.

457
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Huo Xiao died in the fire.

458
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
He was suspected of murder, blackmail and bribery.

459
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,800
The fingerprint of the detective was his evidence.

460
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,800
This was a scandal.

461
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
That's all.

462
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,800
So, Huo Xiao was framed.

463
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,500
Is that what you mean?

464
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,500
Who?

465
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Huo Xiao.

466
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Huo Xiao.

467
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Huo Xiao.

468
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,500
Huo Xiao.

469
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,500
Huo Xiao.

470
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,500
Huo Xiao.

471
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,500
Huo Xiao.

472
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,500
Huo Xiao.

473
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,500
Huo Xiao.

474
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,500
Huo Xiao.
