Those who share the same feelings with each other.

63
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,960
Are you interested in them?

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,000
I am stillcontroling something but I don't know if something wrong with me.

65
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,000
A group of people who are very interesting

66
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,240
Aren't they?

67
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,880

70
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Maybe they can't recognize emotions.

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Maybe they can't share feelings.

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
But no matter what kind,

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
they are all the criminals

74
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
who are controlled by genes.

75
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
You think this is controlled by genes?

76
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
No.

77
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
No matter who they are,

78
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
they are free willed.

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
You don't agree?

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm sorry, Miss Bai.

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
But what you said just now,

82
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
a friend of mine used to say that.

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
What happened between you two?

84
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
People are all like this, right?

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Right?

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Patience, trust,

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
these most precious and high-quality qualities

88
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
are always left to the peers.

89
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
You can't blame him for this.

90
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
After all, who would be willing to

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
entrust their trust

92
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
to a stranger?

93
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
A stranger?

94
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Is that how you see them?

95
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I've always been curious

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
how normal people see them.

97
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
They are all like this.

98
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
A god-given power?

99
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
A serial killer?

100
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Or...

101
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
A monster?

102
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
It's time.

103
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Thank you, Miss Bai.

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
I've learned a lot.

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Pei Su.

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Actually, I really want to know

107
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
how you see yourself.

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Miss Bai, you're thinking too much.

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Those people are the subjects

110
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I want to study in the future.

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
And I'm just

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
an ordinary person

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
with money.

114
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
The 11 districts of Xinzhou

115
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
have voted for

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
the financial and economic test bill.

117
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
17 votes support it,

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
and 24 votes against it.

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
The residents of the West West

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
are conducting a demonstration.

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
As the highest district

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
of Xinzhou's crime rate,

123
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
it's now 20.14

124
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
before the time of Xinzhou.

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
This period is still

126
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
a classic literary work

127
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
left by the previous civilization

128
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
to read for you.

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
The civilization is in a cycle,

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
but we still need to rise.

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
The civilization is in a cycle,

132
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
but we still need to rise.

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
The civilization is in a cycle,

134
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
but we still need to rise.

135
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
The person who voted for the ID

136
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
is the cleaners.

137
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Welcome to continue listening.

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
A road

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
is not a dead end

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
because it's full of gold.

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
The traveler still wants to get closer.

142
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Let those annoying economic

143
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
stay there and die.

144
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Keep your character perfect.

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
This is the only way

146
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I can see you.

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
The person who voted for the ID

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
is the cleaners.

149
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Keep your character perfect.

150
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
This is the only way

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
I can see you.

152
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Keep your character perfect.

153
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
This is the only way

154
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
I can see you.

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Keep your character perfect.

156
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
This is the only way

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I can see you.

158
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Keep your character perfect.

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Keep your character perfect.

160
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Keep your character perfect.

161
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Keep your character perfect.

162
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
This is the only way

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I can see you.

164
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Keep your character perfect.

165
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
As long as you

166
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
use the unbeatable power

167
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
to hold on to the needle and the gun,

168
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
your enemies

169
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
will be bribed sooner or later.

170
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
The smell of new items is too strong.

171
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Their empty minds can't stand it.

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
We must rely on time to fill this smell.

173
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Artistic products must be filled with dust and dust.

174
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Only then will someone understand.

175
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,800
What you just heard is the ice bead box of Qiming Yue Du's product.

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I am the cleaner.

177
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Thank you for listening.

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The next day

179
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
A body was found in the lower west area.

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,800
This is the fourth mission of this month.

181
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
The relevant person in the Xinzhou government

182
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
will answer the questions that the public cares about.

183
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
The crime has been committed in the lower west area for several years.

184
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Has the self-government system in each area

185
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
enhanced the social chaos and chaos?

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
The reason why the self-government system was established in Xinzhou

187
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
is because the situation in the six areas is very different.

188
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
The east area is the financial and cultural center of Xinzhou.

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,800
The south area is the place where foreign immigrants first landed.

190
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Whether it is cultural tradition or language structure,

191
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
each area has its own characteristics.

192
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
A knife knife knife unites the body.

193
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
It is likely to hinder their development and vitality.

194
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
So we will not waver the system

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
that allows the self-government of each area

196
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
to be managed by the patrol team

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
and the regional police.

198
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
It can be confirmed that this system

199
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
has caused an unprecedented crime rate.

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
The International Joint Supervision Bureau

201
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
will set up a special investigation team in Xinzhou

202
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
to solve the problem.

203
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Due to the recent decline in the support rate of the patrol team,

204
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Xinzhou will maintain a peaceful and stable hope

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
to turn to the special investigation team.

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
What do you have to say?

207
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Can you answer the questions

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
that the public cares about

209
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
for the crime committed by the citizens?

210
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Please answer.

211
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Please answer.

212
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Please answer.

213
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
As for whether it is a case of a zero-degree accomplice,

214
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
we need to further investigate

215
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
whether the special investigation team can take on these cases.

216
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
It also depends on whether the case itself

217
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
is in line with their crime.

218
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
After all, except for the death of children

219
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
and personal entrustments,

220
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
the special investigation team generally only accepts

221
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
the investigation of cross-region or major special investigation cases.

222
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Hello?

223
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Luo Yuzheng.

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Team Leader Zhang, I am Tao Ze.

225
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
What is your order?

226
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Tell him to come here.

227
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Captain Luo...

228
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
He hasn't arrived yet.

229
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
This bastard,

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
does he even know where this is?

231
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
He is here every day.

232
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Tell him to go to your office right away.

233
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
I will go to your office right away.

234
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I will go to your office right away.

235
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I will go to your office right away.

236
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Tell him to go to your office right away.

237
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Help!

238
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Help!

239
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Give it to me!

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Help!

241
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Stop yelling!

242
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Xiao Jun!

243
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Don't you want to live anymore?

244
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Help!

245
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Help!

246
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Stop yelling!

247
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Stop yelling!

248
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Do you hear me?

249
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Stop yelling!

250
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Shut up!

251
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
According to the Act of SID Act,

252
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Article 16, Chapter 28,

253
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
In Xinzhou,

254
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
in all areas,

255
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
in the public areas,

256
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
by violent force or other illegal means,

257
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
to steal other people's property,

258
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
should be stopped immediately.

259
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Then, the investigation team will be punished according to the law.

260
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
What are you doing?

261
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Don't interfere with my business!

262
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
You are still laughing?

263
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
You...

264
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Episode 2

265
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Let me go!

266
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
You are really a bully!

267
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I can't stand it!

268
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I can't stand it!

269
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
You said that there was no big situation recently.

270
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
But...

271
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm hurt!

272
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Here.

273
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
The robbery is not over yet.

274
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I've finished.

275
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
I'll leave it to you.

276
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
You...

277
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Who are you?

278
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
A warm-hearted citizen.

279
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Take him away.

280
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Hello?

281
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Let's go.

282
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Captain Luo,

283
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
the next area is to kill.

284
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
We need your help.

285
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I know.

286
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Wait for me at the door.

287
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I'll be right there.

288
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Border Control Center

289
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Any identity of the perpetrator?

290
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
According to information exchanged

291
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
by theOMAN S plataforming team.

292
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
The victim's name is Ke Zhongyi.

293
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
18 de音о.

294
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
He's from Qianzhou.

295
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
A proletarian.

296
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
always works in a till arrived in Xingzhou.

297
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Emergency stop house still has campaigns.

298
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Watch the death time.

299
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
At about 8 a.m.

300
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
to 11 p.m.

301
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
The body was found in the alley

302
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
at the room where the perpetrator dropped down.

303
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
So he confirmed his identity immediately.

304
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,280
Four people died.

305
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,600
The special investigation team was shocked.

306
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
The special investigation team can't handle the case of Xia Xiqu.

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
What is the special investigation team?

308
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,400
There are rumors about the serial killer online.

309
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Where did it come from?

310
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
It's said that the victim's money was stolen.

311
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
His phone is gone.

312
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
His wallet was also stolen and left aside.

313
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The report said that a piece of paper was covered on the corpse's face.

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,400
There was a small piece of tape on it.

315
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,200
It was stuck on the victim's hair.

316
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
The court wrote 100,000 words.

317
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
100,000? Is it a money note?

318
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,600
Is there a picture?

319
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes.

320
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,400
This piece of paper doesn't look like it was just stuck on it.

321
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,000
It looks like the murderer deliberately stuck it on.

322
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Boss, this is a case of Xia Xiqu.

323
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
They didn't let us in.

324
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Can they let us in?

325
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Watch me.

326
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come in.

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Excuse me. Please make way.

328
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Make way.

329
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
It was from that side.

330
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
Then it was left from here.

331
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Anyway, this...

332
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Did you hear that?

333
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Don't worry.

334
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Chief Cui.

335
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Chief Cui, you are...

336
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,600
What is this smell?

337
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Why is it so hard to smell?

338
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
It still smells like someone.

339
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
Why are you here?

340
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
This place is so small.

341
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,000
Why are you here in person?

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
I have no choice.

343
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
This crime scene was already a crime scene.

344
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Right?

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,600
And the place was also very dark.

346
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,200
It made people not want to stay here for a moment.

347
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,800
I shouldn't have come here in person.

348
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
But the Supervision Bureau called me.

349
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,200
They said they wanted to send someone here.

350
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,400
I was worried about the security work in our area.

351
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,800
So I had to come here in person.

352
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
There is no such thing.

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
There is no such thing.

354
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,200
Come on.

355
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Smell the smoke.

356
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,200
I also heard from the Supervision Bureau.

357
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
They said on the Internet that

358
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
about that Liu Cunfen, the leader of the police.

359
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
We are also under the pressure of public opinion.

360
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,200
So I came here to check.

361
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,000
You also know that

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Xinzhou is particularly concerned about the murder of the leader of the police.

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
But the Internet says it is a criminal crime.

364
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
That is a criminal crime.

365
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
I don't think so.

366
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Right.

367
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,600
What Liu Cunfen?

368
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
The Internet is full of nonsense.

369
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
Let me tell you.

370
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
The crime scene of acquaintances.

371
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,400
It is definitely a crime scene of acquaintances.

372
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Look at this place.

373
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
You will understand.

374
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
It is complicated.

375
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
If an outsider comes in,

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
he can't find it in the southeast and northwest.

377
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
That's right.

378
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,200
We couldn't find this place just now.

379
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,000
Right?

380
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,600
Yes.

381
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,200
Yes.

382
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Yes.

383
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Director Cui.

384
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,400
Look at this place.

385
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,600
It is a mess.

386
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,000
We don't want to come either.

387
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
There is really no way.

388
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
You now understand our situation.

389
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
We are in contact with each other.

390
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
What do you think?

391
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Okay.

392
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Thank you.

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Go.

394
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
These are my two colleagues.

395
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
It's okay.

396
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Just take a look.

397
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay.

398
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Just take a look.

399
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Actually, there is nothing to see about this case.

400
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Let me tell you.

401
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,800
I know why you came.

402
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Isn't it just for the three previous cases?

403
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
But look at this case.

404
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
It has something to do with the three previous cases.

405
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
What is that?

406
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
The death of the West Poison.

407
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
This is the evil monkey.

408
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
This is clearly an independent case.

409
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
I don't know why I have to send you here.

410
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes.

411
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I think so too.

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't take photos.

413
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Director Xu.

414
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Just now over there.

415
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,600
The person you talked to.

416
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
I think you look familiar.

417
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
That is...

418
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
Who is that?

419
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
The owner of Hongfu Real Estate.

420
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Jin Zai Hong.

421
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
He is my compatriot.

422
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,000
We have met a few times.

423
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
We have investigated this person.

424
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
He is not a local.

425
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't know what he did.

426
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
He was killed.

427
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
What do you think he did?

428
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
He just stole and robbed.

429
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If I am not from Xinzhou.

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't need to care.

431
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,200
Come.

432
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Take him away.

433
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Wait.

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Such is his pose.

435
00:17:37,200 --> 00:18:03,360
But he mount aGaryheric of his pack with a Turing

436
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,000
It's no wonder what's wrong is in him.

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,720
Thank you, Director Cui.

438
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,600
If this report can't be passed, we have to come again.

439
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,160
Who is that? Xiao Haiyang?

440
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,160
Here.

441
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,960
Come.

442
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,600
Introduce the situation to the chief of the special investigation team.

443
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,760
Chief, according to the inspection at the scene,

444
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,640
the victim has no bruises caused by the struggle.

445
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
But there are traces of suffocation in the back of the brain.

446
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,440
There are signs of bleeding, and obvious scratches in the neck.

447
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,960
The money on the body was also searched.

448
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,320
That's why the rumour of the evil monkeys was spread online.

449
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
Is the death of the suspect clear?

450
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,760
According to initial judgment, the victim was knocked out from the back.

451
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,400
Then, a soft cloth strap was used to hold the neck.

452
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,800
The victim was strangled to death in a coma.

453
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,920
So there are no signs of struggle left at the scene.

454
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,880
The victim's soft voice and the strong head's shielding air were not found.

455
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
There is no clear evidence to show that this is the scene of the crime.

456
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,720
The report is over.

457
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,240
You're talking nonsense without evidence.

458
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,720
You're still making initial judgments.

459
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
You reported it to me, and you're making initial judgments.

460
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,360
This is not the crime scene.

461
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
Where is the crime scene?

462
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,600
Is this a crime scene?

463
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
Why is the crime scene here?

464
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,800
What's the benefit?

465
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Tell me.

466
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,120
I just think...

467
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,800
What do you think?

468
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,520
There is such a possibility.

469
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
What possibility?

470
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Director Cui.

471
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,360
New job, young people.

472
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,560
It's normal to have many ideas.

473
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,520
There's no need to care about this.

474
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,920
By the way,

475
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,040
we need a statement

476
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,440
to write that report.

477
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,360
I heard that the co-pilot lives nearby.

478
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,680
There are group rooms here.

479
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Does he have a roommate?

480
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,680
Why are you so many?

481
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,200
Yes.

482
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
The roommate's name is Miao Xiaowei.

483
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,040
His name is Wu Yue.

484
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,760
When we went there,

485
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,120
he happened to have a fight with someone.

486
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,680
Our people have brought him back to understand the situation.

487
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Excuse me.

488
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,400
Excuse me.

489
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,000
Officer Zheng.

490
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,560
The online news said that the criminal was the one who committed the crime.

491
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Is this true?

492
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,800
The next issue of the case of Jin Yijian

493
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
has a high support rating.

494
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,680
Do you think there's any connection with the murderer?

495
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,280
The case is being investigated.

496
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,800
It's not convenient to leak any information.

497
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,520
Please go back.

498
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,440
Say more.

499
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Say more.

500
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,840
I said the case is being investigated.

501
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
After the investigation is clear,

502
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,200
I will give you an explanation.

503
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Okay, go back.

504
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,480
What's wrong?

505
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,000
What's wrong?

506
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Let him say something.

507
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,680
After the investigation is clear,

508
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,800
I will give you an explanation.

509
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,480
All the information.

510
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:06,880
Okay?

511
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,560
Go back.

512
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,960
Nothing.

513
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
I think I was wrong.

514
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,720
The special investigation team has entered

515
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,720
because they have clearly contacted the previous police officers.

516
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Will they go to see him?

517
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,920
Last night,

518
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,280
behind this private room,

519
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,000
a vicious case happened.

520
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,600
Although the crime scene has been blocked,

521
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,320
the body has been transported to the inspection team.

522
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,480
But just now,

523
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,520
Chief Cui Hongliang

524
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,320
denied the possibility of the criminal

525
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,280
who committed the crime online.

526
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,080
Jie Li said this is a familiar case.

527
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Because the victim and his accomplice

528
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
live near the crime scene.

529
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,520
It happened in the West.

530
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,400
What a coincidence.

531
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,320
What's wrong?

532
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,760
Mr. Pei.

533
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,240
A murder case happened last night.

534
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,480
It was a big deal online.

535
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
Look, there is a live broadcast here.

536
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,400
Really?

537
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,760
I have to remind the company employees to pay attention.

538
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,840
After all, it's important to have a safe life

539
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,280
when you go to work, right?

540
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,800
Mr. Pei.

541
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,040
The group rental house fraud case

542
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,560
was mentioned by Mr. Su two days ago.

543
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,440
It mentioned a place that wants to develop

544
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,560
real estate.

545
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,160
It's the place where the city was updated.

546
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,240
Yes.

547
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,560
I didn't expect that

548
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,040
Mr. Su just said he wanted to develop it.

549
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,400
Then the murder case happened.

550
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,320
Mr. Su also said

551
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,280
this place is close to the East Zone.

552
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,480
It must be very commercial

553
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,080
if we make a good change.

554
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
Now it seems that

555
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,680
the people who are in the fish cage

556
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,880
are all new tenants.

557
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,360
Even if there is a good commercial value,

558
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,280
it's not easy to change.

559
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Move back a little bit.

560
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,240
Sir, what are you doing?

561
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,560
I don't know why Mr. Su

562
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
wants us to develop it with the city

563
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,560
and the red-clad property.

564
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,000
It's not that we don't know that

565
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,880
the red-clad property

566
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,400
has been in bad reputation recently.

567
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,040
Mr. Pei.

568
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm sorry. I can't go back to the company for a meeting.

569
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,320
I have a friend who made trouble again.

570
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,080
I have to see him.

571
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,600
Sir,

572
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,720
turn around.

573
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Tao Fu,

574
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,560
that little eye just said

575
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,680
the crime scene wasn't here.

576
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,320
Why did Mr. Cui react so badly?

577
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
Maybe it's because this place

578
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
is really not easy.

579
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,120
I think the question he asked at last

580
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,280
is very interesting.

581
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,920
Why did he throw the body here?

582
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,720
What's the benefit?

583
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:55,160
GuINGANG victim ma believed that street- Pra Laser

584
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,800
Genau, fellow.

585
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,920
What's the point of staying there?

586
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Tao Fu, is this your friend?

587
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
The new East District can't even accommodate you.

588
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Why are you here?

589
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Do you believe in the inspection industry?

590
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
This is the crime scene.

591
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,080
We've already agreed to work with Hongfu Real Estate to develop the program.

592
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
The materials were already put up.

593
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
But I don't know who was the one who got involved recently.

594
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Some people who died from poisoning didn't even say

595
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
that they even put up the body in this place.

596
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,080
I think this land is not worth it.

597
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Pia Su, what are you doing here?

598
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Does this have anything to do with you?

599
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
I'm just a warm-hearted citizen.

600
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
I happened to see a friend on live and he was fighting with a reporter.

601
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
So I came to give you some friendly advice.

602
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Fighting?

603
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Who's fighting?

604
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Tao Zi, get in the car.

605
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I've already booked a place in the restaurant nearby.

606
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Did I say it's on the afternoon break?

607
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,080
You two, come back to the group with me.

608
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Meeting the last time you were in your prime is one of the most tragic things in the world.

609
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
How about this?

610
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Brother, you and this beautiful lady,

611
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
why don't you take my car?

612
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll take you back to the special team.

613
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
I'll take you to the special team.

614
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
How about taking my car?

615
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
I'll take you back to the special team.

616
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
You've worked hard all day.

617
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
At least take a bigger car.

618
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
You think this is not big?

619
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Mr. Pei, don't experience our delivery car.

620
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
I promise you won't even have your arms.

621
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
Thank you for your reminder.

622
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,080
If you're busy working and working overtime, you have to eat first.

623
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
We're warm-hearted citizens, we don't eat.

624
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
We haven't caught the killer yet,

625
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
and we still have the nerve to eat.

626
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Enough.

627
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
You two are endless.

628
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Let's go.

629
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Are you going to leave, you two?

630
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Look at Xiao Bai's home-work.

631
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Don't waste your time here.

632
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
Beautiful lady,

633
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
do you want to consider transferring to our company?

634
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
You're so good at SID.

635
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
It's too dark outside.

636
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
I'll give you five times the salary.

637
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Enough.

638
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
You're going to say a few words less.

639
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Okay.

640
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
For your sake,

641
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Tao Zi, what are you doing?

642
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
I'm leaving.

643
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Who is this handsome guy named Pei?

644
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Why is he following us?

645
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
What's wrong with him?

646
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
He's not here.

647
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
He's not here.

648
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
He's not here.

649
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,080
He's not here.

650
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,080
He's not here.

651
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
He's not here.

652
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
He's not here.

653
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
He's not here.

654
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
He's not here.

655
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
He's not here.

656
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
He's not here.

657
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
He's not here.

658
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
He's not here.

659
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
He's not here.

660
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
He's not here.

661
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
He's not here.

662
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
He's not here.

663
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
He's not here.

664
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,080
He's not here.

665
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
You're following us?

666
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
You drive quite six steps.

667
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,880
No.

668
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,640
Wang,

669
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,240
Captain Luo.

670
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,960
We agreed to have dinner together.

671
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,000
I knew it.

672
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,040
You've been busy.

673
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,160
I remember this street is not allowed to park.

674
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,760
Yes.

675
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,040
There's one outside.

676
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,360
There's another one behind.

677
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,760
OK.

678
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,360
You're coming.

679
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,320
OK.

680
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,680
I won't delay your work.

681
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,240
OK.

682
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,960
Take care.

683
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,440
Hello.

684
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,260
Flags mention no stopping food Pubẻ

685
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Boss, you came back just in time.

686
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,080
A colleague from the school district just saw Miao Xiao Wei's testimony.

687
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,080
It's that small-eyed man who's different from the others?

688
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Don't mind him. Continue.

689
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Miao Xiao Wei should be the last person to see the victim.

690
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
But he's talking in a mysterious way. It's like telling a ghost story.

691
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
A ghost story?

692
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Miao Xiao Wei, last night from 9 to 9.30,

693
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
there was a resident's reaction near the crime scene.

694
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,080
We heard someone making a noise. Did you hear anything?

695
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
No.

696
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
You heard it, but you didn't hear it.

697
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Why did you think about it for so long?

698
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Maybe I heard a little.

699
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
My TV is on a higher volume.

700
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
What time is it?

701
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
9.30.

702
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Didn't you say you heard a little?

703
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Why did you remember the time so accurately?

704
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Miao Xiao Wei, do you know that you're the suspect in this case?

705
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,080
No, it's not me.

706
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
I heard that voice.

707
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I heard someone making a noise near the old village.

708
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
I wanted to go down there and take a look.

709
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,080
What did you see? Did you see He Zong Yi?

710
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
No.

711
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I didn't see anything. I didn't see anyone.

712
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
There's no ghost shadow.

713
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
It's like everything I heard was an illusion.

714
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
I only know so much, sir.

715
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,080
I really don't know anything else, sir.

716
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,080
It's really not me, sir.

717
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
It's really not me.

718
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
I don't think it's him.

719
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
This kid's psychological quality is really not good.

720
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
If something really happened, he wouldn't have been able to hold it in.

721
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,080
But the ghost is also very strange.

722
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Although we can't judge whether this case is independent or not,

723
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,080
but Miao Xiao Wei's testimony is side-by-side.

724
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,080
This place is really not easy.

725
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Isn't that what Pei Su said?

726
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Who is Pei Su?

727
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
It's us today.

728
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
I...

729
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Let's sort out all the clues first.

730
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
First, it's the crime scene.

731
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Then, it's the 100,000 note that's stuck on the forehead.

732
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
But we can't be sure what it is.

733
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
It should be money.

734
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
This is He Zong Yi's notebook.

735
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
It's all his daily bank accounts.

736
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,080
One of them is marked by the colleagues of the police.

737
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
100,000?

738
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Where did he get all this money from?

739
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Although we can't be sure where the money came from,

740
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
but based on this account record,

741
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
since the 100,000 note was entered,

742
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,080
he seems to be trying very hard to pay off the debt.

743
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Could it be the loan?

744
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
He's trying so hard to save money.

745
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
He might want to pay off the debt as soon as possible.

746
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
So the person he saw last night

747
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,080
could be the person who borrowed the money.

748
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
The person who gave the money

749
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
is a suspicious person.

750
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
I think it's possible.

751
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
There's another clue.

752
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
This was the new phone box.

753
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
This was found in the victim's room.

754
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Miao Xiaowei said

755
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
He Zong Yi has a mom with a cancer.

756
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
He needs huge medical expenses to treat her.

757
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
He's always living a tight life.

758
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,080
He shouldn't have bought such a expensive phone.

759
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Let him check it.

760
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Yes.

761
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Except the scene and the motive,

762
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
there is one more thing you didn't mention.

763
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
What?

764
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Miao Xiaowei said that

765
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
the clothes he went back to change were his.

766
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Isn't this normal?

767
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
It's normal to change clothes,

768
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
but the clothes he changed

769
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
didn't have the change.

770
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
In general,

771
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
if he didn't change the clothes,

772
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
it's because the clothes

773
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
exceeded his level of consumption.

774
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
And because some occasions

775
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
he needed to wear it,

776
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
he wanted to return the clothes.

777
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
If what Miao Xiaowei said

778
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
was to see his fellow countrymen,

779
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
and there was a dispute,

780
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
would he

781
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
rent clothes that he couldn't afford?

782
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,080
I can only ask He Zongyi.

783
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
We asked the investigation team

784
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
to help those

785
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
who couldn't open the door.

786
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Don't talk nonsense anymore.

787
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Just go back.

788
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Yes. I was wrong.

789
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Our next task

790
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
is to investigate

791
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
the dead person's

792
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
human relations.

793
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Otherwise,

794
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
go to the summer camp tomorrow

795
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
and ask Miao Xiaowei and the people

796
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
in the group room

797
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
and He Zongyi

798
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
about it.

799
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Yes.

800
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Xiao Qiao,

801
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
go to the coffee shop

802
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
where He Zongyi often delivers goods tomorrow.

803
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Check the file.

804
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Don't leave any suspicious evidence.

805
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
Yes.

806
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Xiao Wu,

807
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
according to the number of the phone shell,

808
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
locate some locations

809
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
and see if we can find the phone.

810
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
We need a list of people

811
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
who the dead often contact.

812
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
Yes.

813
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Finally,

814
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,080
although this case is not

815
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,080
from the special investigation team,

816
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
but this case,

817
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Cui Hongliang risked his life

818
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
and didn't want to get involved

819
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
with the first three cases

820
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
to prevent the intervention of the special investigation team.

821
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
What kind of problem is there?

822
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
I don't think I need to repeat it.

823
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
Everyone,

824
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
please take it as your own case.

825
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
That's all for today.

826
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
Contact me if you have any news.

827
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
Yes.

828
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Yes.

829
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
Hello.

830
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Captain Lu,

831
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
is this your girlfriend?

832
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
I told her to pay 300 yuan for a parking ticket.

833
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
And then?

834
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
She gave me 1500 yuan.

835
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
She said she would pay 1200 yuan more.

836
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
I'm teaching her for you.

837
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
This is the biggest and most unruly rule.

838
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
The biggest and most unruly rule.

839
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
You haven't got married yet?

840
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
You're still laughing.

841
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Now you know how to behave?

842
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
How is it?

843
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
You open it or I open it?

844
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Get in the car.

845
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
I'm not talking about you.

846
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
You know that

847
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm not a man

848
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
who can't be a man.

849
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
I'm not a man

850
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
who can't be a man.

851
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I'm not a man

852
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
who can't be a man.

853
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm not a man

854
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
who can't be a man.

855
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,080
You know her temper.

856
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
You know her temper.

857
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Next time, don't learn from those

858
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
who are stubborn and aggressive.

859
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
You just got angry.

860
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
You just got angry.

861
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
I'm afraid that's a bit too much.

862
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
After all, for a good person

863
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
like Captain Lu,

864
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
it's probably the biggest trouble

865
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
for us to live.

866
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
It's probably the biggest trouble.

867
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
That's right.

868
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
All right.

869
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I'll hide from her

870
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
from her old age.

871
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Can't I?

872
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
The old age

873
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
is one year older than me.

874
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
You're a bit older.

875
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You're a bit older.

876
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm wondering

877
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
why you two

878
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
always use earphones

879
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
when you mention each other.

880
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
All right.

881
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Since we're out,

882
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
let's not mention her.

883
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Let's go eat.

884
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Tao Zi.

885
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Stinky boy.

886
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
You're not a big boy.

887
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Who cares about Tao Zi?

888
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Take it.

889
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
What's wrong?

890
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
What's this?

891
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
What's dead?

892
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
That's important information.

893
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Hurry up and keep it.

894
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
Don't let it go.

895
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
I'll write it for you.

896
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Song Song.

897
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
There's no blood inside.

898
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Hurry up and keep it.

899
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
You're not even afraid

900
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
of Captain Luo from Gu Jian Chu.

901
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
You're afraid of death?

902
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
I'm not afraid of death.

903
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm afraid of death.

904
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Let's go.

905
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Actually,

906
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
she's just a kind of

907
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
self-training species.

908
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
What's wrong?

909
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm just thinking

910
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
about that dead person.

911
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
Dead person?

912
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
What?

913
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
What's wrong?

914
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
I'm just thinking

915
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
about that dead person.

916
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
I'm so eager to

917
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
meet someone.

918
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
But I never thought

919
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
that it's better

920
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
for her to die.

921
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
What?

922
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
The death of a person's coat.

923
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
If you don't pick up the new clothes,

924
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
you'll wear it.

925
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
It's also possible that

926
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
it's more expensive.

927
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
It's because this dress

928
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
exceeds its consumption.

929
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
And because some manufacturers

930
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
need to wear it,

931
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
so they want to sell it

932
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
after wearing it.

933
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Some unprofessional students

934
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
will feel like this

935
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
when they just start the interview.

936
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
You're right.

937
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
You're thinking

938
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
about it with Captain Luo.

939
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
You're talking the same thing.

940
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
Really?

941
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Then what do you think

942
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
she's wearing

943
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
to meet someone?

944
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
It should be someone

945
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
who's important to her

946
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
and has power.

947
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Power?

948
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Why do you think so?

949
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Because this dress

950
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
doesn't fit.

951
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
It's just a little more expensive.

952
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
But when she wears it,

953
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
she looks too

954
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
like a woman.

955
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
If she's not going to the interview,

956
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
she should go to meet

957
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
someone who's very important to her

958
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
and who's much better than her.

959
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Then what do you think

960
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
it means to put a note

961
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
on the dead's face?

962
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
It might be

963
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
preventing the death of a person.

964
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
Or

965
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
regretting after killing someone.

966
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Pretending to be someone else subconsciously

967
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
to show respect and love for the dead.

968
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
What if it's not

969
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
covering the whole face?

970
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
For example, it's just a small note

971
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
stuck on the dead's forehead.

972
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
It only covers a small part of the forehead.

973
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Forehead?

974
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Elders are training the younger generation.

975
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
Strong people bully the weak.

976
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Training small animals

977
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
is usually a big forehead.

978
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Or a label.

979
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
The things in the mall

980
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
will have a label.

981
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
No matter what you say,

982
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
this person should be...

983
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
How do you describe it?

984
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Emotional compassion,

985
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
and obstacles.

986
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Right?

987
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Self-love is

988
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
the most typical one.

989
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
People who are extremely narcissistic

990
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
often like to follow the development of the case.

991
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
If they are too arrogant

992
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
to be an extreme,

993
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
or even take away

994
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
something from the crime scene,

995
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
what kind of psychology is this?

996
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
What psychology?

997
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Commemorative.

998
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
If I were her...

999
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Su.

1000
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
You Lan.

1001
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
I was just kidding.

1002
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
This is not a joke.

1003
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Wei Zhao has said many times

1004
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
that the spirit of compassion is very dangerous.

1005
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Don't go and touch the murderer's heart.

1006
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
I'm home.

1007
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I've remembered this meal.

1008
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Hold your hand.

1009
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Pei Su.

1010
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
The past is over.

1011
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
People should look forward.

1012
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
You want to marry someone else,

1013
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I advise you

1014
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
to trust them.

1015
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Don't put yourself

1016
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
in the outer shell of your disguise.

1017
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
Even if you try to take a step forward,

1018
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I know what you want to say.

1019
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
You are not the person

1020
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
you said.

1021
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
I, Lang Long,

1022
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
think so.

1023
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
It's been seven years.

1024
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
You still don't want to forgive him?

1025
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Your mother's son

1026
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
has really tried his best.

1027
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
He has lost his sister,

1028
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
false testimony, and confession.

1029
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
All the evidence points directly

1030
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
to the fact that this is really a suicide.

1031
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I didn't mean that.

1032
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Then why are you

1033
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
not willing to forgive him?

1034
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,080
It's late, brother.

1035
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Don't go home.

1036
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,080
Why are you not willing to forgive him?

1037
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
Pei Su.

1038
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
Why did you kill him?

1039
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
The truth is,

1040
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
I didn't kill him.

1041
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
I just wanted to

1042
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
make sure that

1043
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
he was not the one

1044
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
who killed him.

1045
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
I just want to

1046
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
make sure that

1047
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
he was not the one

1048
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
who killed him.

1049
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
I just want to

1050
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
make sure that

1051
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
he was not the one

1052
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
who killed him.

1053
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I just want to

1054
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
make sure that

1055
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
he was not the one

1056
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
who killed him.

1057
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,080
I just want to

1058
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
make sure that

1059
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
he was not the one

1060
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
who killed him.

1061
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
I just want to

1062
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,080
make sure that

1063
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
he was not the one

1064
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
who killed him.

1065
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I just want to

1066
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,080
make sure that

1067
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,080
he was not the one

1068
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
who killed him.

1069
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
I just want to

1070
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
make sure that

1071
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
he was not the one

1072
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
who killed him.

1073
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
I just want to

1074
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
make sure that

1075
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
he was not the one

1076
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,080
who killed him.

1077
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
I just want to

1078
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
make sure that

1079
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
he was not the one

1080
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,080
who killed him.

1081
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,080
I just want to

1082
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,080
make sure that

1083
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,080
he was not the one

1084
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
who killed him.

1085
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
I just want to

1086
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
make sure that

1087
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
he was not the one

1088
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,080
you killed.

1089
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,080
Then I just want

1090
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,080
to have more time

1091
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
to think that

1092
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
he was not the one

1093
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
who killed him.

1094
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
Will things better

1095
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,800
How deep can it be?

1096
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,680
Will you be my companion?

1097
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,560
How many times will the soul be separated?

1098
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,400
Only when you open the new door

1099
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,120
How many times will the bullet be able to pierce through your eyes?

1100
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't want to fight against the will of the world

1101
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,880
I only want to hear your voice

1102
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,680
How deep can it be?

1103
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,320
Will you be my companion?
