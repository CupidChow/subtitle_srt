1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ah

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ah

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ah

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ah

9
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Paisu

10
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Paisu

11
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Paisu

12
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Paisu

13
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We can't get there yet.

14
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We can only fight together now.

15
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're so lucky to have a backup.

16
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm not as lucky as you are.

17
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hm

18
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Paisu

19
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Paisu

20
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It seems that these bastards

21
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
are going to fight to the death.

22
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Captain Luo

23
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If I kill them all

24
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll be able to get them back.

25
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Paisu

26
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your life

27
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
is much more valuable than that.

28
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Paisu

29
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hurry

30
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't move

31
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Be careful not to fall

32
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't move

33
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hurry

34
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hurry

35
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Go

36
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hurry

37
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Paisu

38
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Paisu

39
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's okay

40
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Paisu

41
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Boss

42
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you okay?

43
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Captain Luo

44
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You scared me to death.

45
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm here

46
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's the matter?

47
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come

48
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No

49
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Paisu

50
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Captain

51
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Captain

52
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you Hu Xuechun?

53
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you okay?

54
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm fine

55
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm fine

56
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's go to the SID

57
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and record the details.

58
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay

59
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Luo Weizhao

60
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you know what you're doing?

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're a hero

62
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're acting rashly

63
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
when you're not in the position

64
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm fine

65
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're too unorganized

66
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Captain

67
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't scold me

68
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I know I made a mistake

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
of my personal heroism

70
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Next time

71
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Next time?

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No

73
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Absolutely not

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I promise I won't do it again

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Captain

76
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How's it going with the Red Army?

77
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's a reception over there

78
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have to ask him

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't worry

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You'll be in charge

81
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've brought them all back

82
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can interrogate them

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Including Jin Zaiwu

84
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Whether it's He Zongyi's case

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or Fan Du's case

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I've already got the permission

87
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
from the Xinzhou government

88
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and the Supervision Office

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We'll take over

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Great

91
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
By the way

92
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where's Chen Zhen?

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He's trying to save Wu Xiao

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go to hell

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Luo Weizhao

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No matter if these two cases

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
are connected

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The special investigation team

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
will investigate both cases

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll be waiting

102
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you thirsty?

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes

104
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Where did you get hurt?

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Nothing

106
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I just bumped into them

107
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why did you come here?

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why did you hurt them?

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I thought

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
it was a common murder case

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who knew that a case

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
would be involved

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and it would be a case

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
of a gang of Fan Du's

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
who are involved in the case

116
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and who are involved in the case

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Fan Du?

118
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's a gun

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why are you here?

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you following me?

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm here to see

122
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
where He Zongyi lives

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why are you going there?

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
His mother said

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
she wanted to see

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
where his son lived before he died

127
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That place is full of

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
fraudulent goods

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and mysterious

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
stuff

131
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But there are still

132
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
many new and unknown places

133
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to live

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The one who stole the house

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
the one who has a family

136
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and the one who has a family

137
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
is the one

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
who cares about the country

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and keeps the money for the family

140
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Is He Zongyi a gambler?

141
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He is a good boy

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A gambler who doesn't gamble

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and only wants to

145
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
show his mother

146
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
how he died

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
when he was there

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hello, Taozi

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You guessed right

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We just released Zhang Donglan

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and there are new clues

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
on the door

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What are they?

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Zhang Donglan's driver

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
just came

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and said he found

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
a tie with blood on it

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is it a fake?

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The result just came out

160
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and it's a fake

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a fake

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a fake

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a fake

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a fake

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a fake

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a fake

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a fake

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's a fake

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a fake

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's a fake

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The result just came out

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and it's He Zongyi's

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This tie should be Xiong Qi's

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll send you the phone number

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Taozi

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Lao Wei Zhang

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's wrong with you?

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You didn't even

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
say a word about such a big thing

181
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and you're investigating it in private?

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You really think you're a superhero?

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Lord Taozi

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was scolded by the team just now

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't make me suffer anymore

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What do you mean?

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Are you hurt?

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I just have a bruise

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
How can I be so easily hurt?

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Come back with me

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and I'll give you a private education

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, okay, okay

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's so late

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why are you here?

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He Zongyi's mother

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
just called me

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She might be in the reception room

199
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
of the noble family

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and she's been waiting for me

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll go in first

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't sit

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Thank you

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll go in first

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's talk about something serious

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Otherwise, we won't be able to sleep

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
tonight

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How's it going?

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The flying car team

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and Jin Zaihong

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
just entered the reception room

213
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But I think Jin Zaihong's

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
attitude

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
about sending Zhang Donglan

216
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
to the reception room

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
is not very good for now

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How's the driver?

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's being interrogated

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He said that after

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
sending Zhang Donglan back

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
he found him under the seat

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
of the passenger seat

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He looks quite honest

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The point is not there

226
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The point is who put the tie there

227
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This person is really too selfish

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What do you say?

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Captain Luo

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Captain Luo

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I brought the sample for you

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Jin Chengyu

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You continue interrogating

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's go

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Auntie

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You've made up your mind

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
after you caught the murderer

238
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you going home?

239
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's so late

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Auntie has troubled you

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's nothing

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll accompany you

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
My mom is not here yet

245
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Before she died

246
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
she also took medication every day

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and couldn't go to work

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
At that time

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
my dad was away from home

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
because of work

251
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I lived far away from school

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I lived with my nanny

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
near the school

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I went home every week

255
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to see her once

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're such a handsome young man

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Your mom must like you very much

258
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
She must be waiting for you

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to go home every day

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We, who are mothers

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
if we don't have

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
any special abilities

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and we can wait for her every day

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it's you

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Auntie

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Sir

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Auntie

269
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is He Zongyi's mother

270
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You know my son

271
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He Zongyi

272
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You know my son

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
right?

274
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Zongyi is a good boy

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You must know him, right?

276
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Tell me

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
who killed Zongyi

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who did it?

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm begging you

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Auntie, I'm begging you

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm begging you

282
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Tell me, okay?

283
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm begging you

284
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Tell me, okay?

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's me

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry, Zongyi

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry

289
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sorry

290
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm sorry

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Auntie, Auntie

292
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm sorry

293
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm sorry

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sorry

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sorry

296
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I know

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Miao Xiaowei

299
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's not him

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Miao Xiaowei said

301
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he had been addicted to drugs

302
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and was addicted to gold and silver

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So he looked at He Zongyi's new phone

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and wanted to take it out for trading

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
After He Zongyi came back from work that day

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
he suddenly remembered that phone

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and couldn't find anything

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So he questioned him in person

309
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Miao Xiaowei was so confused

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
that he refused to admit it

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
In the end, they left without exchanging

312
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That night

313
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Miao Xiaowei traded drugs with his phone

314
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He wanted to wait for He Zongyi to come back

315
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and let him search for his stuff

316
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But He Zongyi didn't come back

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and died in that place

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Gold Triangle Control Area

319
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes

320
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Miao Xiaowei said

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the place where He Zongyi died

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
was the place where they often traded

323
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Only the familiar with this code knew

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Miao Xiaowei thought He Zongyi

325
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
saw his own deal

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and wanted to take back his phone

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and was beaten to death

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What did Gold Triangle Control Area say about these statements?

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Of course they denied it

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I think it's true

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Gold Triangle Control Area

332
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
wanted to take back his phone

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and killed someone

334
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and took over the special investigation

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's not good for him and Cui Hongliang

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
How do you know

337
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Miao Xiaowei is not the murderer?

338
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I never thought of him as a suspect

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
He Zongyi's note was too bold

340
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
As Pei Su said

341
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
the murderer is a narcissistic personality

342
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
who dares to expose himself in front of us

343
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and is too far from Miao Xiaowei

344
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And if according to my conclusion

345
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
According to your conclusion

346
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
after we caught Zhang Donglan

347
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
the murderer has been trying to make Zhang Donglan back

348
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and has been closely following the progress of the case

349
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But when the tie was sent over

350
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Miao Xiaowei was always searching for his stuff

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
so he is not the murderer

352
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Both suspects are not the murderer

353
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So who killed He Zongyi?

354
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Who tried to frame Zhang Donglan?

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Did you check Zhang Donglan's name list?

356
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I did

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But there is no suspicious person

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think we missed something

359
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
According to our conclusion

360
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He Zongyi was the murderer

361
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He said that he went to meet a powerful person that night

362
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And this person

363
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
happened to be Zhang Donglan's man

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Even if he couldn't pay back the money

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
he wouldn't kill anyone

366
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes

367
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Why?

368
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He was the one who chose to kill him

369
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't know

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What are you looking at?

371
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You would have brought a cigarette

372
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
If you didn't smoke

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you would have re-mixed it and picked another one

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This is a cigarette

375
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Why would I pick it?

376
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What's wrong?

377
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What's wrong?

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What's wrong, Donglong?

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What's wrong, Donglong?

380
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Zongyi's murder

381
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What's wrong, Donglong?

382
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What are you looking for?

383
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Where is the business card?

384
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
What business card? Whose business card?

385
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Are you looking for this?

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,340
get over there.

387
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,540
Come on.

388
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,600
Come on.

389
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
I can't let you get in my way today.

390
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,240
try again.

391
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,440
No, what's wrong with kill me?

392
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,540
I'm sorry, men's talk talk talk talk,

393
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
but most of them got scared into the ground.

394
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, oh.

395
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,860
You got scared into the ground,

396
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,820
man with had an accident?

397
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,500
What happened to that guy?

398
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,700
And where the fuck did you get that explosive?

399
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,500
We just gave him a small sample from we took him rather expecting

400
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Captain Luo, I went to see He Zong Yi's mother.

401
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
I wanted to ask her again, but she disappeared.

402
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Why didn't she leave before?

403
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Why did she leave after picking up the phone at midnight?

404
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
What did she do?

405
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Captain Luo, please zoom in.

406
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
The direction before the mother left was opposite to the road.

407
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
There was no bus or subway at this time.

408
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
It was difficult to get a taxi.

409
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
But look at her eyes.

410
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
It seems that someone is waiting for her.

411
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I didn't stop.

412
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Xiao Yang, check the surveillance camera.

413
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
We must find the partner.

414
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Yes, sir.

415
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
We must find the way to the mother.

416
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,500
We must search around the house and the residence of Zhang Donglan.

417
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
The person who took her is likely the murderer.

418
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Tell the brothers not to be careless.

419
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Yes, sir.

420
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Captain Luo, can I go with you?

421
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
No, you can't.

422
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
She committed suicide.

423
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
How do you know?

424
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
She told me herself.

425
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
The funny thing is, I didn't hear it.

426
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
What do you think?

427
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,500
If we, the mothers, don't have any special abilities,

428
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
we can look forward to it every day.

429
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Pei Su,

430
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,500
the only thing I look forward to every day is you.

431
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
It's you.

432
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I didn't hear it.

433
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Captain Luo, if I go,

434
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
she can at least listen to me.

435
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
To be honest, I've been in this field for so long.

436
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
This is the first time I've seen such a bold murderer.

437
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Look, at this time,

438
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
he took He Zongyi's mother away from the special forces.

439
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
He's afraid that Zhang Donglan will recognize him.

440
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
He looks a little suspicious.

441
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,500
A murderer like him can't fight a battle.

442
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
He's afraid of an extreme,

443
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
a kind of military force.

444
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Moreover, Captain Luo, you successfully let him think that

445
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Zhang Donglan is the suspect.

446
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
He just doesn't dare to arrest him because of his background.

447
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
So he took He Mu out and told him to commit suicide.

448
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
He forced you to arrest Zhang Donglan.

449
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
We went to Zhang Donglan's residence.

450
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
We didn't find any signs of He Mu.

451
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Continue searching.

452
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Captain Luo, Xiao Han Yang.

453
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Tell me.

454
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
We found that He Zongyi's mother

455
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
was in a private car accident.

456
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
The registration number is fake.

457
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
We found that the car disappeared

458
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
after 5.54 from the south-south route.

459
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
There was no sign of the car.

460
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
It should have entered the east or west.

461
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
We're still investigating the surveillance.

462
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Donglan.

463
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
If it were me,

464
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
I would make this suicide a performance.

465
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Everyone would see it.

466
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
After all, for people like them,

467
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
the meaning is more important than the actual situation.

468
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I'm not a murderer.

469
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm a murderer.

470
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm a murderer.

471
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm a murderer.

472
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
The time is more important.

473
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
The exhibition is at 8.

474
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Send the team to support the CBD in the new east district.

475
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Yes.

476
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
As the world's e-sports industry's

477
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
international e-sports exhibition,

478
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
it will be held today in the commercial street

479
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
in the east district of Xinzhou.

480
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
The opening day is expected to attract

481
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
170,000 audiences.

482
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
At the same time, we will use the online and offline combination

483
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
to release products and technology.

484
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
The most eye-catching event

485
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
is the opening ceremony of the exhibition.

486
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
Captain Luo, the team has sent the people here.

487
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
They are now investigating the exhibition.

488
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
This won't do. We must find the target.

489
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
The traffic here is too big.

490
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
If it were me,

491
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I would make this suicide a performance.

492
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Everyone would see it.

493
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Attention, everyone.

494
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Search the ceiling of the building

495
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
with the skylight as the center.

496
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Yes.

497
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
It's me.

498
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
All the money in the skylight

499
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
is in the building.

500
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Find Mr. Li for me. Hurry.

501
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Xiao Qiao,

502
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
you take people to search for cars nearby.

503
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:10,020
Xiao Wu, connect the

504
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
The building is in the building.

505
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,020
The building is in the building.

506
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
The building is in the building.

507
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
The building is in the building.

508
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
The building is in the building.

509
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
The building is in the building.

510
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
The building is in the building.

511
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
The building is in the building.

512
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
The building is in the building.

513
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
The building is in the building.

514
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
The building is in the building.

515
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
The building is in the building.

516
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
The building is in the building.

517
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
The building is in the building.

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
The building is in the building.

519
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
The building is in the building.

520
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,020
The building is in the building.

521
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
The building is in the building.

522
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
The building is in the building.

523
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
The building is in the building.

524
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
The building is in the building.

525
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
The building is in the building.

526
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
The building is in the building.

527
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
The building is in the building.

528
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
The building is in the building.

529
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
The building is in the building.

530
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
The building is in the building.

531
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
The building is in the building.

532
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,020
Good-bye.

533
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Zongyi,

534
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,020
I had to make it this far for you.

535
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
I'm going now to go poop by you.

536
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,880
This is a missing person at the Red Cross윗

537
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:55,040
Rather than웅

538
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,620
Ohhey there are so many people

539
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,640
Who are they?

540
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:58,860
ushi

541
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,740
Is something wrong with this video was followed

542
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,840
Just take it

543
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,000
OK

544
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,260
everyone

545
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,120
Bergen

546
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,120
We need to get the car and the license plate number to the police station.

547
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
Call the police and report it to the police.

548
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Send some people to the police station to keep the order.

549
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,120
Don't let anyone talk and disturb their mood.

550
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Go.

551
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Zou Yi.

552
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Zou Yi.

553
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,120
Go.

554
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
Team 3.

555
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
There are security cameras on the roof of the building.

556
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
We can get them. Don't waste time.

557
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Tao Zi, go out and check the passage.

558
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Team 4. There's no way out.

559
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Team 5.

560
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Zou Yi. Zou Yi.

561
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Zou Yi.

562
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Zou Yi.

563
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Hello, auntie.

564
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
I called you but you didn't pick up.

565
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,120
So I can only try to contact you in this way.

566
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
If you can see me,

567
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,120
please give me two minutes to listen to me.

568
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
Auntie.

569
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,120
If my own mother is still alive,

570
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
she should be about your age.

571
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
I'm closer to Zou Yi.

572
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,120
After all, she had to save money to treat you.

573
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,120
I was just a student who had nothing to do.

574
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Every weekend,

575
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,120
my mother would change the new flowers in the vase in advance.

576
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,120
She would force herself to cook what I liked.

577
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
She would clean my room.

578
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,120
She would take my cup and dry it.

579
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
She didn't want to live with the nanny.

580
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,120
So she had to do all these things herself.

581
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Will you also dry your cup?

582
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
But one day,

583
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,120
I was looking forward to going home.

584
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
When I opened the door, I found

585
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,120
there was only a pile of white smoke in the vase.

586
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
All the windows were closed.

587
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,120
There was only a smell of dead air in the house.

588
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
I walked into the house,

589
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,120
but I found that what was waiting for me was not a dry quilt,

590
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
but her body.

591
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
You told me not long ago

592
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,120
that my mother must have been waiting for me to go home every day.

593
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,120
But the police officer told me

594
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,120
that she was killed on the day I went home.

595
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I was always on time every time I went home.

596
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
She knew it all along.

597
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
But...

598
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Mom,

599
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Mom,

600
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
I've always wanted to ask you

601
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,120
what kind of mother would take the time

602
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
to leave her body to her child.

603
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,120
I've been thinking about how I can please you every day.

604
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,120
Pei Su,

605
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,120
the only thing I've been hoping for every day

606
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
is you.

607
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
I'll make you happy no matter what.

608
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
I've been thinking

609
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,120
about how I can buy you the money to treat your illness.

610
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,120
How I can pay off the money I borrowed from others.

611
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,120
But I still haven't got enough money.

612
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,120
I can't go home alone in the cold.

613
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
If you were so cruel,

614
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,120
why did you have to act like you cared about us?

615
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Mom!

616
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Let's go!

617
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Boss, we found her!

618
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
She's on the roof of Shuangzi Building.

619
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Go get her!

620
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,120
The power's out. What's going on?

621
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Captain Lu, we found a car that killed a suspect.

622
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
Impossible!

623
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,120
This murderer is not a big deal. He must be on the roof of Shuangzi Building.

624
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Raise your hand!

625
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Yes!

626
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Auntie,

627
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
the murderer hasn't been caught yet.

628
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
You don't know the situation yet.

629
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
You're so confused.

630
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,120
How are you going to talk to the police?

631
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,120
When the murderer is caught,

632
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,120
you have to take the police home.

633
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,120
I want to stay with you for a while.

634
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Can you give me another chance

635
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,120
to pretend to see my mom?

636
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Mom!

637
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Mom!

638
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
Mom!

639
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Xiuying!

640
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
Xiuying!

641
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Xiuying!

642
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Xiuying!

643
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
Catch her!

644
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Hold on!

645
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,120
Don't let go!

646
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Xiuying!

647
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Hurry! Help!

648
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Come on!

649
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,120
Harder!

650
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Mr. Pei, we're saved!

651
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Auntie, it's okay.

652
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,120
SID, you're under arrest.

653
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,120
Zhao Hongchuan.

654
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Be careful.

655
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Be careful.

656
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,120
Be careful.

657
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,120
What are you doing?

658
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,120
You come with me.

659
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I'm a strong man.

660
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,120
I don't need public medical resources.

661
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Look at you.

662
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
You're so arrogant.

663
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,120
Get in the car.

664
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,120
Stay in the hospital tomorrow.

665
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
Don't come back.

666
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,120
What?

667
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,120
You're not a grown man yet.

668
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,120
You're going to take the throne?

669
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
You...

670
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,120
Fine. Where's Pei Su?

671
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
I don't know.

672
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,120
I'm not sure.

673
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,120
I'm not sure.

674
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,120
I'm not sure.

675
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,120
I'm not sure.

676
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
I don't know.

677
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,120
You didn't find him?

678
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,120
Boss!

679
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,120
The phone rings as a player.

680
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,120
I'm playing a song for you, right?

681
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
Why don't you go see him?

682
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
We're all saved.

683
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
I'm not sure.

684
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
I'm not sure.

685
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
I'm not sure.

686
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,120
I'm not sure.

687
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,120
You're not sure?

688
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,120
Zhou Hongchuan broke the high-altitude protective barrier on the roof.

689
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
It's just a little short.

690
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,120
What you said on the roof

691
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,120
is true?

692
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,120
I'm a patient with emotional emotional disorder.

693
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
So of course not.

694
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,120
I just mixed up my experience with his

695
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,120
and tried to establish a relationship with him.

696
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,120
I investigated your father back then.

697
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
In the process,

698
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
I found another group of people

699
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
who were also investigating and following him.

700
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,120
When they caught him,

701
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,120
they were a group of young men who claimed to be private detectives.

702
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,120
You spent the money, right?

703
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
One more time.

704
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,120
You were writing homework at Tao Zi's house.

705
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,120
You left some documents that you hadn't used.

706
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,120
There were some traces of the documents.

707
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,120
I used a pencil to paint them.

708
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,120
I found out that it was a form of your father's form.

709
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Your mother had an accident for more than two years.

710
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
I was thinking,

711
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,120
in the past two years,

712
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,120
you wouldn't have been paying attention to your father's form, right?

713
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,120
I was thinking,

714
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,120
this whole thing

715
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,120
made me feel like I was being fooled.

716
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
Then your father had an accident.

717
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,120
So you suspect that I made the handkerchief?

718
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
It's very likely.

719
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
Captain Luo,

720
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
compared to Pei Cheng Yu,

721
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,120
whether he's dead

722
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
or alive,

723
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,120
I think he's still alive.

724
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,120
I think he's still alive.

725
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
I think he's still alive.

726
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
I think he's still alive.

727
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
I think he's still alive.

728
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,120
I think he's still alive.

729
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,120
I think he's still alive.

730
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,120
I don't care if he becomes a plant.

731
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
I'm the only heir to his property.

732
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,120
And for us,

733
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,120
it's what you call

734
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
the one who has the same spirit as the other.

735
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
I don't care about his death.

736
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,120
As long as...

737
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
I'm talking to you.

738
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,120
Can you stop, Zhao Rui Xian?

739
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,120
Who the hell is Zhao Rui Xian?

740
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,120
You.

741
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,120
I'm sorry.

742
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,120
I'm sorry.

743
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
I suddenly feel

744
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
that in order to save a woman I don't know,

745
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
I have to sacrifice my life.

746
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
I have to sacrifice my life.

747
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
I have to break my own wounds

748
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,120
in the public.

749
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
I won't be a dangerous person.

750
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,120
I plan to apologize to you

751
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,120
for my prejudice and doubts.

752
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,120
You don't have to apologize to me.

753
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,120
After all, I'm not the one.

754
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,120
I'm a stranger.

755
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,120
The world that's always out there

756
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,120
is a flower garden.

757
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,120
No one knows what kind of monster

758
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
is hiding underground.

759
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Like Zhou Hong Chuan,

760
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,120
a lawyer who graduated from

761
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,120
the Law Department of Xinzhou University of Political and Legal Affairs,

762
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,120
but he's law-abiding.

763
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
So, Officer Lu,

764
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,120
you've been using your evidence of belief

765
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
to deduce that a woman

766
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,120
is not wrong.

767
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
Wait.

768
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
What did you say?

769
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,120
I said you're not wrong.

770
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,120
Not this sentence.

771
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,120
The last sentence.

772
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,120
You've been using your evidence of belief

773
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
to deduce and judge a woman.

774
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,120
No, no, no.

775
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
That's the sentence you just said.

776
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
A lawyer who graduated from

777
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,120
the Law Department of Xinzhou University of Political and Legal Affairs,

778
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,120
but he's law-abiding.

779
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,120
So, the link between these two cases

780
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,120
is here.

781
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,120
I'm leaving too.

782
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120

783
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Lu Weizhao.

784
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
It's me.

785
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,120
It's me.

786
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
Lu Weizhao.

787
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
It's me.

788
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,120
You haven't recovered yet.

789
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
What kind of hero are you?

790
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,120
I'm from the Cultural and Political University.

791
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
I'm just a senior here.

792
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
I'm about to retire.

793
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
