1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is a fraud, a fraud, and a fraud. He is my driver, but I never let him do anything. Mr. Zheng, Mr. Zheng

6
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,240
Mr. Zheng, please say something to me. Let me go. Mr. Zheng, thank you. I'll go to the hospital to see Mr. Zhou

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Mr. Zhou

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,240
Xiao Bu, you have done a good job for the group

9
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Taozi, speak

10
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Lao Luo, the gangsters in the city did not go to jail

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,240
What? No jail?

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Yes, who would bring back the secret door when killing people?

13
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Unless

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Unless what?

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Unless the gangsters didn't plan to kill Zhou Huaiqing at the beginning

16
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Then I want to ask who is the biggest victim of this matter?

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Give me water

18
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Is this Zhou Qiu? Did you know the result?

19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Pei Ye, what are you talking about?

20
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Stop pretending, I just met you yesterday

21
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
You can't see your father for a year

22
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,240
He never cared about your family's property, private property, or family property

23
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,240
From yesterday to now, you only said a few words when you were stealing Mr. Wu's phone

24
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Even if Uncle Liang is your father's private property, there is no need to do such a big crime

25
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Your old man is lying in peace now

26
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,240
He can just do a DNA test, this is kidnapping, this is killing, what is the purpose?

27
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
DNA test? He can do whatever he wants, he really killed us

28
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,240
He burned the old man and didn't let him get a hair cut, he just wanted money

29
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
He is a little bit of a thief, he is very cunning

30
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Now the three funds you have on the Internet are enough for you to eat

31
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Even if it's fake, just one check is enough to make you hurt

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,240
If he really wanted your family's property, he wouldn't hurt people like that

33
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
What did you say?

34
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
I said everything, I just said it

35
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
I don't understand business

36
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,200
I knew it was impossible for your family to be a foreign country when I opened the door for the

37
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I know how to handle this kind of thing

38
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Buying someone, let him be a scapegoat, not let him leave any evidence to send him in

39
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Give him money he can't earn for the rest of his life

40
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,240
But no one in the T-Z Yang family can betray their master

41
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Even if you betray your master, you will still be able to escape punishment

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
You will be in prison and you will be able to get your family involved

43
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
There is no rule

44
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
I don't know what rules you have

45
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,240
When the kidnapper threw out the first question, you took Mr. Wu's phone

46
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
His phone has already been logged into your account

47
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I didn't even notice it until you said it

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
It turns out that Wu Zhenyu is so quiet

49
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Actually, I was ready to report that illegitimate child

50
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Of course I have to take the lead in this kind of thing

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
The more real it is, the less suspicion it has

52
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,240
I warned you to be careful when you restore the treasure

53
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
You clearly heard it at the time

54
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
But you passed it to Zhongli Chu

55
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
I don't know what to do

56
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I don't know what to do

57
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I don't know what to do

58
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I don't know what to do

59
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Zhongli Chu?

60
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Why?

61
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Is it because your big brother...

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
I kidnapped him

63
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Mr. Pei

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,240
This is the only conclusion you want to hear

65
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Someone framed Yang Bo

66
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Li Yingwan and kidnapped my big brother

67
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
And then they killed the illegitimate child

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,240
I think I'm the only one who's benefited from this

69
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I'm the suspect, right?

70
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Pei, why didn't you tell the SID's executives?

71
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Do you really think that someone outside is playing with you?

72
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Do you really think he doesn't know?

73
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Mr. Zhong, I have something to ask you

74
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Please open the door

75
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Do you really believe that Yang Bo is your father's illegitimate child?

76
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you really believe that your father would have been raised by his wife

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
and his son for so many years

78
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
and he wouldn't have dared to admit it?

79
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,240
If not, how did that fool Yang Bo get to where he is today?

80
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Are you sure that the result is Yang Bo's?

81
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
You don't know, do you?

82
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
That's enough, Mr. Pei

83
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
I know you're very thoughtful

84
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
You don't have to help me anymore

85
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
I won't turn myself in

86
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,240
If the SID is smart enough

87
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
let them investigate it themselves

88
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,240
If you want to report it, do it

89
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I don't care

90
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
I don't care

91
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
You're going to help investigate it?

92
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Okay, I'll go back with you later

93
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Why are you rushing?

94
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
You don't even give me time to remove my makeup

95
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
You should explain it to me in person

96
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
in the bathroom with the SID

97
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
No, don't you think you're being too much?

98
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
What did you say to him?

99
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Who made Wu Zheng Yu step into the backstage in advance?

100
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Who made the kidnappers keep circling around the White Shark?

101
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Who didn't want to kill Zhou Huai Jing?

102
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Who wanted to kill Zhou Jun Hao?

103
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
So, is Zhou Huai Jing a suspect now?

104
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Whether he's a suspect or not

105
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,240
when the case is not clear

106
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
you can talk to the case staff in private

107
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,240
It doesn't meet the SID's rules

108
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
No matter what your purpose is in coming to the SID

109
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
since you're here

110
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
you have to follow the rules

111
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Don't forget your identity

112
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Go back and report it

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Hello, Du Jia

114
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Help me investigate someone named Yang Bo

115
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Especially his family background

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
The more I think about it, the better

117
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,240
The SID came early in the morning

118
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
I don't know why they've been investigating for so long

119
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Didn't you read the news a few days ago?

120
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
There's a charity family member who's been missing for a long time

121
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
They're all dead

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
They're all dead

123
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
They're all dead

124
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
They're all dead

125
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I read the news a few days ago

126
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
A charity family member was killed

127
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
What charity family?

128
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:37,200
It's a fake

129
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Sir, is the killer in the village in our neighborhood?

130
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You said you lived next door to the killer

131
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I have a house to rent

132
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Will the house price be affected?

133
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I have a house to rent too

134
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
This is...

135
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
What if something happens to the killer?

136
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
That's right

137
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
What's going on?

138
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Your SID is facing a security problem

139
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You're making a fool of yourself

140
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
What attitude?

141
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
How can this attitude be like this?

142
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
What attitude?

143
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Let's go

144
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Dong Xiaoqing

145
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Can you still live here?

146
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
It's been a long time

147
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
No one will remember this

148
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
No one will remember this

149
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
No matter how big the changes are

150
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
No matter how big the changes are

151
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,220
They will only become a word of the people's

152
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
No one will remember

153
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
No one will mention

154
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220
But he can't forget

155
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
He can't forget himself

156
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
No one can forget

157
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,220
Xiaoqing

158
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
Your father's death

159
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
We are all very sad for you

160
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Take care of yourself

161
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Take care of yourself

162
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
The technical department means

163
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
You should take a good rest

164
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Go out for a vacation

165
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
The company is not in a hurry

166
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,220
You can come any time

167
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,220
We've already talked to the personnel

168
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Just complete the resignation process

169
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,220
As long as the company doesn't die

170
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,220
Okay, President Wang, thank you.

171
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,220
No trouble, no trouble.

172
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
If you have any difficulties, you can tell me anytime.

173
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,220
We will try our best to solve them.

174
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,220
Hello, Ms. Dong.

175
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
We are the reporters of the News Daily.

176
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
We have a few questions for you.

177
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Is it because of Zhou Jie's number that you have been exposed to the public?

178
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,220
Ms. Dong.

179
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
Just like that.

180
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I am sorry.

181
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,220
If you have any difficulties, you can tell me anytime.

182
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
Mr. Bai Lu.

183
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,220
Zhou Hua has been awake for a while.

184
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,220
She didn't have time to say a few words, so she went to sleep.

185
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
She said that she hit a taxi at the airport.

186
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
She didn't expect that someone was hiding in the back seat.

187
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
She suddenly fell down on the way and cried.

188
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
When she woke up, she was already in the train.

189
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,220
She also said that no matter who kidnapped her,

190
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
she didn't plan to pursue her.

191
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Luo, Zhou Jie said that Zhou Jie was the one who kidnapped her.

192
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
She didn't plan to pursue her.

193
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Luo, Zhou Jie said that Zhou Jie would not cancel the request

194
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,220
to ask SID to withdraw the kidnapping investigation.

195
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
As long as Zhou Junhao's car accident is still there,

196
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,220
we have the right to continue investigating these two cases.

197
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
You mean...

198
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
I have already sent Xiao Qiao to the airport to monitor her.

199
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,220
After all, there are too many people in this world who don't want Zhou Huai Jing to die.

200
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
Zhou Huai Xing.

201
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,220
Wu Zheng Min.

202
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,220
Zheng Kai Feng and Yang Bo.

203
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
Even Zhou Huai Jing himself.

204
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,220
Anyone among them may have different intentions

205
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,220
to expose the secret of the Zhou family.

206
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
But as Pei Su said...

207
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,220
So I think the kidnapper doesn't want to hurt Zhou Huai Jing.

208
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,220
But what about Zhou Junhao?

209
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,220
No matter what, Dong Xian didn't kill anyone.

210
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
If Zhou Junhao is the leader of the accomplice,

211
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
is this really an accident?

212
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Wei Zhao.

213
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
Did you see the update?

214
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
Pan Yi!

215
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Pan Yi!

216
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Who is it?

217
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,100
The

218
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
I can't stand it.

219
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
Zhou Huai is so drunk.

220
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Where is everyone?

221
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Where did they go?

222
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Xiao Hanyang went to check on Yang Bo's personal report.

223
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
Xiao Wu took Huai Xing to the hospital.

224
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Tao Ze should be arranging people to monitor Yang Bo and Zheng Kai Feng.

225
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Then what are you doing?

226
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
I'm writing a review.

227
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I can't stand it.

228
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Zhou Huai is so drunk.

229
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,220
I checked all the surveillance footage of Zhou Huai Jing at the airport yesterday.

230
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,220
I didn't find him.

231
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Do you think I'm blind?

232
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,220
Which parking lot did you see?

233
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,220
The parking lot for the taxi.

234
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,220
You can try the parking lot for the social vehicle.

235
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
Social vehicle?

236
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Isn't Zhou Huai Jing's taxi?

237
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
What else can I say?

239
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
I already said it.

240
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
It was Yang Bo's doing.

241
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,220
Sir, I already said everything I should.

242
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,220
I really didn't order it.

243
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
I did log on the official website in advance.

244
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
That was just in case.

245
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
Who can take over Zhou's business if it's old man's doing?

246
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,220
Isn't it obvious?

247
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,220
Even if I want to recognize the ancestors,

248
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,220
I don't have to slander Mr. Zhou as a spiritual leader.

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,220
I'm really worried about Mr. Zhou's safety.

250
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,220
Who knows Huai Xing...

251
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
What you just said is just a guess, right?

252
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Do you have any evidence?

253
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,220
What you asked about

254
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,220
should be part of the economic investigation.

255
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,220
The special investigation team also received such an order.

256
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
I'm sorry.

257
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
Everyone thinks that Ma Er Kang and Dao Na Ben

258
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
killed their kind father.

259
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
What?

260
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Did you see this scene too?

261
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
Who doesn't want to kill Zhou Huai Jing

262
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,220
and who wants to kill Zhou Jue Zuo?

263
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,220
If Yu Lian is Zhou Hong Chuan,

264
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
and Heng Bo is Xu Dong Yu,

265
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,220
then who is Shi Jun Zhe?

266
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,220
The civilization has returned,

267
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
but we still need to make a name.

268
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,220
This award is the eternal tragedy of Shi Jun Zhe.

269
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
The award is for the cleaners.

270
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,220
The cleaners, welcome to continue listening.

271
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,220
I'm already in the bloodbath of both tribes.

272
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,220
If I don't make my way forward,

273
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
then the path back

274
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
will also be a test.

275
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
They told me

276
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,220
that the accident was not a coincidence.

277
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
And the ultimate goal

278
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
is to kill Yang Qin.

279
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
Your mother

280
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
is just a victim

281
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
of a big business fight.

282
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,220
The person behind this

283
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,220
is Zhou Jun Hao from Zhou Group.

284
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Now,

285
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,220
I have the chance to kill that murderer myself.

286
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Zhou Huai Jing from Zhou Group

287
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
wants to kill her father.

288
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Liu Xue is a life-and-death person.

289
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
They said

290
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,220
Liu Xue must be led to bloodbath.

291
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,220
The things that didn't start well

292
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
must be punished.

293
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
It's her nightmare.

294
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Liu Xue

295
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
Tao Fu

296
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,220
You just came back from the hospital?

297
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Yes.

298
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
How are you?

299
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,260
I was told by the boss to check the surveillance cameras at the airport to find Zhou Huai Jing.

300
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
But I couldn't find him anyway.

301
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,180
He's really in the parking lot.

302
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,180
Pei Su is amazing.

303
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,180
Look.

304
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,220
Go and call Luo Di.

305
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Luo Di.

306
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Brother.

307
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
Don't you have anything to say to me?

308
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
What do you want to say?

309
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,220
Brother.

310
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,220
No matter what, no matter what you do, you are my brother.

311
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
What are you talking about?

312
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,220
I'm not your brother. Who else can I be?

313
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Brother.

314
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Let's go home.

315
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Here.

316
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,220
2.20 a.m. on the 17th. Zhou Huai Jing enters parking lot 3.

317
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,220
Continue.

318
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Stop.

319
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Leave the parking lot.

320
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Professor Su.

321
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,220
Zhou Huai Jing bought a car at the parking lot.

322
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Boss, we checked the surveillance cameras at the airport to find Zhou Huai Jing.

323
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Look.

324
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,220
We enlarged the sign that Zhou Huai Jing saw.

325
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,220
The elevator is the direction to the parking lot.

326
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
The forward is the direction to the parking lot.

327
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,220
Here's the problem.

328
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,220
If Zhou Huai Jing wants to go back by taxi,

329
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,220
why does he have to go to the parking lot to get lucky

330
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
instead of going to the parking lot by taxi?

331
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Captain Luo.

332
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,860
The report of the

333
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
What does it say?

334
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Yang Bo and Zhou Jun Hao have no blood relations.

335
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,220
What?

336
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
I'm going to the hospital.

337
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
Where's Pei Su?

338
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,220
He went to see Du Zu this morning.

339
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
He should still be in the office.

340
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
Go get him.

341
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
I'll wait for him in the building.

342
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
Okay.

343
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
We have to go now.

344
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Okay.

345
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
I'm sorry.

346
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,220
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

347
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Tao Feng,

348
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Dong Xiao Qing has something to do.

349
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
I have to go.

350
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Dong Xiao Qing?

351
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
What did she do?

352
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
I don't know.

353
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,220
I just got a message from her.

354
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
She's going to the hospital.

355
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
What?

356
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
She's going to the hospital.

357
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
What?

358
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
She's going to the hospital?

359
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
What?

360
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
She's going to the hospital.

361
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
What?

362
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
She's going to the hospital.

363
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
What?

364
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
What does her business have to do with the eyes?

365
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
What is she going to do?

366
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
The End

367
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
What did you talk about with Du Zu?

368
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
About my research in the living room,

369
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
I did investigate some old cases.

370
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,220
But some of them were cut off by Du Zu.

371
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Cut off?

372
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
Why?

373
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
I did a little research.

374
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
There's not much of a problem.

375
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,220
I've already found some unnecessary ones.

376
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,220
These cases are relatively old.

377
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
They are not very valuable for reference.

378
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,220
I'm afraid you'll have to repeat the work.

379
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
If you ask Mr. Pan,

380
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
just tell him that.

381
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
He'll understand.

382
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
I understand.

383
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Thank you, Mr. Du.

384
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,220
I heard my master mention this.

385
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
The Lingdu Project

386
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,220
is trying to study from a criminal's perspective.

387
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220
It has completed the investigation of the case.

388
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,220
So it interviewed many of the victims who had been convicted.

389
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
But then,

390
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
the research started to divide.

391
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
As we all know,

392
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
in our society,

393
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
there are 1.3% of people

394
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
born with a genetic deficiency.

395
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
They can't communicate with others.

396
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,220
So in the process of the research,

397
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
someone suggested

398
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
that genetic learning and criminal psychology

399
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
must be linked.

400
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
They thought that the genetic deficiency

401
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,220
meant that the person could not control his desire.

402
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,220
He would also become a serial killer.

403
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
This point of view received a lot of support.

404
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,220
Some even started to question

405
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,220
that the killer in some cases

406
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
was not a normal person who was convicted at the time.

407
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
But a person with a personality of anti-socialism.

408
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
Finally,

409
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
the other suspects were involved

410
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,220
in the case

411
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,220
under the clues provided by the family.

412
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
This incident

413
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
caused a lot of trouble in the group.

414
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
It was the biggest public opinion crisis

415
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
since the SID was established.

416
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Finally,

417
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
the Lingdu Project was called to an end.

418
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
The genetic testing bill

419
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
was also proposed at that time.

420
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,220
What happened after that?

421
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
The special investigation team

422
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
was re-investigated.

423
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
There were no problems with these cases.

424
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
We guessed that

425
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
it was because

426
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
the group of people who were

427
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
in the mood to transfer to the Lingdu Project

428
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
would be easier to accept

429
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
than the family who had an accident.

430
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
Later,

431
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,220
a person who was very clear

432
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
supported this point of view.

433
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Although I don't know who this person is,

434
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
he must be one of the early promoters

435
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
of the genetic testing bill.

436
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
Who is that person?

437
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
I don't know.

438
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Yang didn't tell me.

439
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
I tried to check later.

440
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
But all the information

441
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,220
of the Lingdu Project

442
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,220
was sealed.

443
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
Except for the group of people,

444
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
no one else had the right to fish.

445
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Later, my master said

446
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
this person had died long ago.

447
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
I've said so much.

448
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
It's your turn to speak out.

449
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Pei Su.

450
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Why did you get involved in the policy of the new government?

451
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
Why did you put so much effort

452
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,220
into the re-establishment of the Lingdu Project?

453
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
Stop playing tricks on me

454
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
with your fake skills.

455
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
I'm asking you this very seriously.

456
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
What do you want to say?

457
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,220
I don't know.

458
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I just want to say

459
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,220
that I'm still feeling a little bit Gustavo's.

460
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
But I don't think I can do it.

461
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I'm telling you,

462
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
I can't do it.

463
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
So I'm telling you now.

464
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,220
I can't do it.

465
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I'm telling you now.

466
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
I can't do it.

467
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
I can't do it.

468
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
I'm telling you now.

469
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm telling you now.

470
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
I'm telling you now.

471
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I can't do it.

472
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Let's go back!

473
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Don't shoot!

474
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Let's go back!

475
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Let's go back!

476
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Let's go back!

477
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
It's weird.

478
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
It's okay. Just shoot.

479
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
It's useless.

480
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
Tian Yi.

481
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Look over here.

482
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,220
The special forces want to talk to you.

483
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
How is it? Can you get away from there?

484
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Do you want us to find a place to meet?

485
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Okay.

486
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Then...

487
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Miss Dong is here!

488
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
Miss Dong, are you here?

489
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Why are you here?

490
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Wait a minute. I'll call you later.

491
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,220
I'm the only one left in our family.

492
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
My father caused such an accident.

493
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
Maybe our family can't afford to pay for the property.

494
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,220
I want to see him apologize in person.

495
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
Let him come here.

496
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
He didn't hit her.

497
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Poor thing.

498
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Miss Dong!

499
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Dong Xiao Qing?

500
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Why is she here?

501
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,220
Miss Dong!

502
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Miss Dong, don't push!

503
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
I know it was an accident.

504
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
It's okay.

505
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Miss Dong, don't push!

506
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Miss Dong, don't push!

507
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Miss Dong, apologize to Miss Dong tomorrow!

508
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
One person is not enough.

509
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,220
Why can't my father let me go?

510
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
I'm the one who killed you!

511
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Miss Dong!

512
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Miss Dong!

513
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Miss Dong!

514
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Miss Dong!

515
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Miss Dong!

516
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Miss Dong!

517
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Miss Dong!

518
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,220
Boss!

519
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Boss!

520
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,220
I'll call the doctor.

521
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,220
Huai Xing!

522
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,220
Huai Xing!

523
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,220
Huai Xing!

524
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
Brother, are you okay?

525
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
Huai Xing!

526
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Mr. He, are you okay?

527
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
He Xiao Qing!

528
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
He Xiao Qing!

529
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,220
You can't run away!

530
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
He Xiao Qing.

531
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
Listen to me.

532
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,220
The person you stabbed just now,

533
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
he's not dead.

534
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
This matter

535
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
won't be very serious.

536
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Look.

537
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,220
I'm from SID.

538
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,220
You can tell me

539
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,220
what's wrong.

540
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
Huai Xing!

541
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
Hold on!

542
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
Huai Xing, it's okay!

543
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
Huai Xing, look at me!

544
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
Hold on!

545
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Huai Xing!

546
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,220
Huai Xing!

547
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,220
My father...

548
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
Your father is innocent. We all know that.

549
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Don't worry.

550
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,220
We will clear his name.

551
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
My father...

552
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,220
My father is innocent!

553
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Mr. He, I'm sorry.

554
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,220
I can only choose this way.

555
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Huai Xing!

556
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
He is also a member of SID.

557
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,220
They...

558
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Huai Xing!

559
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,220
Huai Xing!

560
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,220
Hurry!

561
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,220
Hurry!

562
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220
Hurry!

563
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,220
Hurry!

564
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Hurry!

565
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Everyone is afraid to die.

566
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
But what they are afraid of

567
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
is actually just fear.

568
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Black Soul,

569
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
we are the memories

570
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
chosen by the heavens.

571
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
Why do we have to fight against them?

572
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
You have to know

573
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
that we are

574
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
1.3% of the people of the world.

575
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,220
You are really

576
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,220
a perfect monster.

577
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,220
Huai Xing!

578
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Huai Xing!

579
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,220
Huai Xing!

580
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
I'm not familiar with

581
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
the general manager.

582
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
But...

583
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
I have played with Huai Xing

584
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
a lot.

585
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
I know Mr. Pei.

586
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
I know.

587
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,220
I know.

588
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
I know.

589
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
I know.

590
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,220
I know.

591
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,220
I know.

592
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
I know.

593
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Huai Xing has been saying

594
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
three things without leaving his brother.

595
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,220
He is like a child who has no children.

596
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
I heard that his ears are getting shorter.

597
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
It's okay.

598
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,220
It's okay.

599
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Huai Xing will be fine.

600
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
Huai Xing will be fine.

601
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,220
He has been talking about

602
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,220
the knife.

603
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,220
He might have thought of something.

604
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,220
You...

605
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,220
Mr. Zhou.

606
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Although he is famous,

607
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
he is still for you.

608
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220
I know.

609
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,220
I just...

610
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
I'm not talking about him blocking the knife for you.

611
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Do you believe that

612
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
the liar will be punished?

613
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,220
Liar.

614
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
The lie will come true.

615
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
Should we start

616
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
with the fact that

617
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,220
you planned to kidnap yourself?

618
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
What are you talking about?

619
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
I don't understand.

620
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,220
After you got off the plane on the 17th,

621
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,220
you called your family and said

622
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
you would go to the car accident.

623
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
But you didn't go to the accident report.

624
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
You went to the social car parking lot.

625
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
How about the kidnapper's car?

626
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
The car accident.

627
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,220
The car accident.

628
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,220

629
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,220

00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,220
