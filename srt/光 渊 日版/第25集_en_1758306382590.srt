1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,720
oh

3
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,200
oh

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
ah

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
The main thing is his death.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,480
It's exactly the same as the way he killed his husband, Yu Bin.

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
Yun Heng.

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,480
Do you believe that

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,160
the heaven is full of retribution?

10
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,000
The Elimination Mana

11
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,760
Ep váctima

12
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You want to ask me something?

13
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
When was your brother last in contact with his family?

14
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's been seven or eight years.

15
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My brother told me that he was in Xinzhou.

16
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He said that he had to leave if he offended anyone.

17
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
My mother was still alive at that time.

18
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So he could send money back every three or five years.

19
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
About five or six years ago, my mother died.

20
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We couldn't reach her.

21
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I followed the address of her last payment and went to her.

22
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Where was it?

23
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
On Li Island.

24
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I asked around and found her after half a month.

25
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
She looked rich and had a good life.

26
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But she didn't want to come back.

27
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
She said that she offended a very powerful enemy.

28
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She was afraid that they would kill her.

29
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't see how powerful her enemy was.

30
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I was angry and said that she wouldn't come back.

31
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I said that if she didn't come back,

32
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I would consider that she was a bastard.

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you don't come back, you will be punished sooner or later.

34
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So you didn't contact her after that?

35
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What else can I do?

36
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I considered her dead since that day.

37
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Our family is not like that.

38
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Bastard.

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why are you wearing gloves at home?

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I got hurt while working at the power plant.

41
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's been a long time.

43
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you.

44
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you.

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Have some water.

46
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What do you do?

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I work for a company.

48
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He works in the fuel department and I work in the canteen.

49
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You are colleagues?

50
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You met at work?

51
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How long have you been married?

52
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
More than 30 years.

53
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Almost 32 years.

54
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Sir, what do you want from my uncle?

55
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He hasn't contacted us for years.

56
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He won't come back.

57
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Enough.

58
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You stupid old woman.

59
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't understand anything.

60
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go back to work.

61
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

62
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What else do you want to know?

63
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I need your help.

64
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you have the receipt of Lin Tao's remuneration?

65
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or the address of the letter?

66
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We have it all.

67
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We didn't keep it.

68
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We are not family.

69
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why do we have to keep it?

70
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We want to check your messages and emails.

71
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Maybe he contacted you.

72
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But you didn't do anything else.

73
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He didn't contact us.

74
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is a big case of SID.

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Can you put your children's names in the list?

76
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's all for today.

77
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We'll leave you alone.

78
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wait.

79
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you think about Lin Tao, please contact us.

80
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't want to.

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He is not a normal person.

82
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He can't live a normal life.

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He came to our house because he was a ghost who asked for money.

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He only did business.

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He always goes out and makes people around him scared.

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He left...

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He left for so many years.

88
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He even caused trouble for our family.

89
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't come here again.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What's your attitude?

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This...

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What should we do?

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This person...

94
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This...

95
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is impossible.

96
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He has been hiding for 30 years.

97
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Pafu.

98
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Old Mei's file.

99
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's talk in the car.

100
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Pafu, I just flipped the pages.

101
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The new one is the previous one.

102
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not new.

103
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Besides the fire in Sena River,

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it says that when he escaped,

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
he was found dead.

106
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
His hands were burnt.

107
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He didn't even have his fingerprints.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Turn around.

109
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hurry.

110
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hurry.

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
SID, open the door.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Lin Min, go back to the special forces and investigate.

113
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Open the door.

114
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Where is Lin Min?

115
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He just went out.

116
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Where did he go?

117
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He said something happened in the company.

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So he left in the car.

119
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey.

120
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Let's go.

121
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hello?

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What?

123
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going back to find him.

124
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's gone.

125
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll take someone to find him.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Tao Ze, you...

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I need you to contact the witness group

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and make a red motorcycle for Wu.

129
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay.

130
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll send someone to find him in 5 minutes.

131
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll ask the Nau Wan patrol team to help.

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tao Ze, don't...

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No need.

134
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's not safe.

135
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Lin Min is important.

136
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll take him back.

137
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You won't let me go even if you die.

138
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Wang Wei Zheng.

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You think you can hide

140
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
from your family

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
after you've been traveling for a week?

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Listen.

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Even if he's a plane carrier,

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
he can only sink.

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You want 50,000 cash

146
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
or your mom,

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
brother,

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and nephew's head?

149
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Think it over.

150
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Who did you mess with?

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Who did you mess with?

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Tell me.

153
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Who did you offend?

154
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Those people are

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
from the dark society,

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
right?

157
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
My partner is

158
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
a spy from SID.

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let me see

160
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
if I can find someone

161
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to protect you.

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't lie to me!

163
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Lin Min!

165
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Lin Min is there!

166
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Lin Min!

167
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Be careful.

168
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Go!

169
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Position!

170
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Turn left!

171
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Lin Min!

172
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Stop!

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Lin Min!

174
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Lin Min!

175
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Stop!

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Position!

177
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Turn left!

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't worry.

179
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Trust me.

180
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Even if I die here,

181
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I won't let you die.

182
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Good.

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Listen to me.

184
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm going to the hospital.

185
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll be back.

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll be back.

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll be back.

188
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll be back.

189
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll be back.

190
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Good.

191
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Listen to me.

192
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Brother.

193
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll be back.

194
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't be afraid.

195
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Xiao Wu!

196
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Xiao Wu!

197
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Xiao Wu!

198
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Xiao Wu!

199
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Xiao Wu!

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Help Lin Min!

201
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The video is leaked!

202
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't look!

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's too dangerous!

204
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't look!

205
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Tong Feng!

206
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Wake up!

207
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Tong Feng!

208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Tong Feng!

209
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Tong Feng!

210
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Lin Min!

211
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Tong Feng!

212
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Wake up!

213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Tong Feng!

214
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Wake up!

215
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,480
Uhm villager

216
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,180
Convert to Lightless

217
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,680
Get that hated villager

218
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:40,760
Robo

219
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
What?

220
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Say it again.

221
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
When Pika rushed over,

222
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
the fugitives rushed over to protect Old Mei.

223
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Our car was with them.

224
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
It was on fire.

225
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
It was lit up.

226
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Pika died instantly.

227
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Boss, this is a fake.

228
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Where?

229
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Which hospital?

230
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
What's going on?

231
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
What's going on?

232
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
What happened?

233
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Boss.

234
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
What happened?

235
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
We were on our way to the North,

236
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
to catch Ling Ming.

237
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
We were on our way to the North,

238
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
and Pika rushed over.

239
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Tao Fu wanted to push him away.

240
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
We turned around.

241
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Fortunately, the patrol found a fire in the truck

242
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
and smashed the door to save him.

243
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
I just checked the body,

244
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,760
and there was no time to go over.

245
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
The truck exploded.

246
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
The man was hit by a shrapnel.

247
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
He's being rescued now.

248
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I told you to wait for help!

249
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Why are you still...

250
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Are you mad, boss?

251
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
All right.

253
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
You're my father now.

254
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Why are you crying?

255
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Where's Mingming?

256
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
Is she still alive?

257
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
She's still alive.

258
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
She was thrown out by another truck.

259
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
She hit herself and fell down.

260
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Her leg was crushed by the truck.

261
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
She was unconscious just now.

262
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
She's in the kindergarten now.

263
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Find someone from the New Palace to keep an eye on her.

264
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Whether she's in the hospital or being rescued,

265
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
she can't be released for 24 hours.

266
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
As long as she's still alive,

267
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
the people who killed her will come again.

268
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
All right.

269
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Doctor, how is she?

270
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I'm sorry.

271
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
We've tried our best.

272
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Wencheng.

273
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Wencheng.

274
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Wencheng, look at me.

275
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Wencheng.

276
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Sister.

277
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Wencheng.

278
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Wencheng.

279
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Wencheng.

280
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Wencheng.

281
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Wencheng.

282
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Wencheng, open your eyes.

283
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Wencheng.

284
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Wencheng.

285
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Wencheng.

286
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Wencheng.

287
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
What if...

288
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
What if...

289
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I'll be back.

290
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Sit down and rest.

291
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Look,

292
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
it's the dead opposite the dead.

293
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,760
It's likely that the government is trying to point the Teacher!

294
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Looks like La 매ная is the structure of 프� villeux,

295
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
he suspects she's farms.

296
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
I also suspect that's a coincidence.

297
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,560
Was her goal to prove the surprise from the teacher by giving him

298
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,720
the antidote and push her to the rescue?

299
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
No.

300
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
What about the lyrics?

301
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
It's song and dance.

302
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,760
This old man, even if he can prove that he framed Huo Xiao and did fake evidence,

303
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,760
but in fact, Du Pucheng has already explained all these things.

304
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Why did the organization want to kill him so soon?

305
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,760
Could it be that he has touched the core of the organization?

306
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,760
In addition to Pei Cheng Yu, Wei Zhahong, and Zhou Junhao, the organization has never really acted.

307
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,760
They have never shown their true face in front of them.

308
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Just like Wang Li, a leader and a trusted person,

309
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,760
does he need Zheng Kaifeng or the organization to accept him?

310
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Could it be that the other party saw Tao Zeman on the street and arrested Li Minghao?

311
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
What did they know?

312
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
They sent a Pika to kill him.

313
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
It's too late.

314
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Senior,

315
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,760
we don't have to worry about whether the other party is an organization or an accomplice.

316
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
We don't have to judge their purpose.

317
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Someone leaked the information between us.

318
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,760
There was a little man next to Tao Zuo,

319
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,760
and a brother who led the south bend patrol team.

320
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,760
And he called me today.

321
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Tao Zuo and Bao Li found the Pika and we were very careful.

322
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
And he called me on my private phone.

323
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
My phone is absolutely fine.

324
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
There are only two people and one car that are in trouble.

325
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
The car is an engineering car.

326
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
There are records of parking and usage.

327
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
This way, the search is not stopped.

328
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
Hello, I'm going to the hospital right now.

329
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Captain Luo, I...

330
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Don't come over yet.

331
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,760
You go and help me check the recent movements of the two people.

332
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
One is

333
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Wu.

334
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,760
And the other is the Kouwei City of the south bend patrol team.

335
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,760
And you go and check the recent usage records of the two cars that Tao Zuo drove today.

336
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
I want to know what kind of people he used and where he went.

337
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Including the usual rubble and five maintenance personnel.

338
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Remember, it's everyone.

339
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
It's okay if you need to learn.

340
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I'm the only one on this road.

341
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
I'm sorry.

342
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
I'm sorry.

344
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Tang Lin, sit down.

346
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Here.

348
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Thank you.

349
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Thank you.

350
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
I'm sorry.

351
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
The pain slowly went away.

352
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
When we broke up,

353
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,760
he was still in a daze for over a month.

354
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
He was still in a daze.

355
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
He helped that girl carry her luggage.

356
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
After carrying it, he asked me to drink.

357
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
He was so confused.

358
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
What kind of person is Tao Zuo?

359
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,760
I guess he will never say anything good in his life.

360
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,760
And he will never do anything romantic.

361
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
He is good to people.

362
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,760
He is always in a daze.

363
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,760
You can't find it if you don't pay attention.

364
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
When I was the captain,

365
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
I was used to being the captain.

366
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Tao Zuo didn't know how many fruits he had carried for me.

367
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
If it wasn't for the office that Zhang was in,

368
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
I wouldn't have been able to help.

369
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm afraid I'll never know.

370
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
I'm afraid I'll never know.

371
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
After all this, we can all go to the office.

372
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,720
The

373
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
It's all the patient's family.

374
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
The director has finished the operation.

375
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
The patient mainly had a fracture in the accident.

376
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
And internal bleeding.

377
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
The car exploded and he was blocked with his back.

378
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
He needs to be in the intensive care unit for a night.

379
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
If the situation is stable,

380
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
there should be no life danger.

381
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Boss, the patient is awake.

382
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
But the car accident caused internal bleeding.

383
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,760
We need to sign the operation.

384
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
We need to find the victim.

385
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Housufen.

386
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Girl.

387
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
53 years old.

388
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Chinese.

389
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
You and Lin Ming are husband and wife.

390
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Do you know Lin Ming's older brother, Lin Tao?

391
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Then you know Lin Tao may have died.

392
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
And the murderer may be your husband, Lin Ming?

393
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Answer me, Housufen.

394
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
She didn't tell me anything.

395
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
I didn't ask you if she said it or not.

396
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
I just asked if you knew your husband might have killed someone.

397
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
After a while,

398
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
she often said that she was going to kill someone.

399
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
She said that she was going to kill someone.

400
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
She said that she was going to kill someone.

401
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
She often had nightmares.

402
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
In the middle of the night,

403
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
she was being played by a nightmare.

404
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
She always cried out loud.

405
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
She often shouted.

406
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
What did she shout?

407
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
She shouted,

408
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
don't bother me.

409
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Get away from me, Lin Tao.

410
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Don't bother me.

411
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Your soul is not with you.

412
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Get away from me.

413
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Don't bother me.

414
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Get away from me.

415
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Our family

416
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Our family

417
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
has a flat.

418
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
We have a yard.

419
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
We have a yard.

420
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
We have a yard.

421
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,760
There were two big tree trees in the yard.

422
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
There were two big tree trees in the yard.

423
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
But he fell down.

424
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
He was like a sick person.

425
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
But he fell down.

426
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
He had to cut those two trees.

427
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
He told me

428
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
that the trees were impolite.

429
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I felt something was wrong with him.

430
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Where is the house?

431
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,760
The house is in the old town he went to today.

432
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
His older brother used to live there.

433
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
He was a good boy.

434
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
He was a good boy.

435
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
He was a good boy.

436
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
He was a good boy.

437
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
He was a good boy.

438
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
He was a good boy.

439
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
He was a good boy.

440
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
He was a good boy.

441
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
He was a good boy.

442
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
He was a good boy.

443
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
He was a good boy.

444
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
He was a good boy.

445
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
He was a good boy.

446
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
He was a good boy.

447
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
He was a good boy.

448
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
He was a good boy.

449
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
He was a good boy.

450
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
He was a good boy.

451
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
He was a good boy.

452
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
He was a good boy.

453
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
He was a good boy.

454
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
He was a good boy.

455
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
He was a good boy.

456
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
He was a good boy.

457
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
He was a good boy.

458
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
He was a good boy.

459
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
He was a good boy.

460
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
He was a good boy.

461
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
He was a good girl.

462
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
He was a good boy.

463
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
He was a good boy.

464
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
He was a good boy.

465
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
He was a good boy.

466
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
He was a good boy.

467
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
He was a good boy.

468
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
He was a good boy.

469
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
He was a good boy.

470
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
He was a good boy.

471
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
He was a good boy.

472
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
He was a good boy.

473
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
He was a good boy.

474
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,760
The results of Lin Min's surgery are not optimistic.

475
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,760
The doctor said that although the surgery was done,

476
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
he still doesn't know when he will wake up.

477
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,760
And there will be a sequela after he wakes up.

478
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,760
The optimistic thing is that he is half-dead and can't speak clearly.

479
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
If it's more serious, he will simply

480
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,760
not be able to recover his normal cognitive level.

481
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
What?

482
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
He is stupid.

483
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
Why is he stupid?

484
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,760
If he is stupid, I will just make up for it.

485
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I will just let him go over there and apologize.

486
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Senior, calm down.

487
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Let's go find other clues.

488
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
What other clues can we find?

489
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
He left and is now in a panic.

490
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
He thinks I am stupid.

491
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Even my colleague, I don't know who to trust.

492
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,760
As the leader, I am the only one who can help the world.

493
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,760
And me.

494
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Senior.

495
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Captain Luo.

496
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Captain Luo, you told me to check the people and vehicles

497
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
that were used that day.

498
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
They are all here.

499
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
There are two copies. One is for Brother Xiao Wu.

500
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,760
The other is for the South Bay patrol team, Kong Wei Cheng.

501
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Tell me the key points.

502
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
The key point is Kong Wei Cheng.

503
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Kong Wei Cheng, a South Bay person, didn't work in South Bay before.

504
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
He didn't work in the patrol system.

505
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
He used to be an SID.

506
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
He is considered our predecessor.

507
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
So?

508
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
I investigated his file.

509
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
He used to work in our 5th action team.

510
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
The leader of the 10-15 team...

511
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
It's Team Leader Du.

512
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
What does that mean?

513
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,760
When Tao Fu and the others returned to their home,

514
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
he received a call.

515
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
I printed the call records.

516
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
It's Team Leader Du.

517
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Brother Xiao Wu and I have confirmed that

518
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,760
before the arrest, he saw Kong Xun Cha calling.

519
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
He even asked.

520
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Kong Wei Cheng said that the leader was concerned about this.

521
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
He reported to him.

522
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Brother Wu thought it was the patrol team.

523
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
So he didn't care.

524
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,760
I also found out that Kong Wei Cheng was assigned to the West Forest.

525
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Du Zu told him to come back to the South Bay.

526
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Xiao Han Ying, are you crazy?

527
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
If it were you, you would have killed someone first and then saved them.

528
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
And then you would have put yourself in danger to save them?

529
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I know he is a hunter.

530
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
I also know that the people in South Bay would beat me.

531
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
You want to beat me too.

532
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
But I don't care if you believe it or not.

533
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Before the arrest, he had a crush on Du Zu.

534
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
That's the truth.

535
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
Why do you suspect Du Zu?

536
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
It can't be Du Zu.

537
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Boss, say something.

538
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
People will change.

539
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
If you can use the phone to call and change your job,

540
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
you can use this as evidence.

541
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Then you can arrest me too.

542
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
I am also under Du Zu's arrest.

543
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
I also have a suspicion.

544
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
You...

545
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Xiao Qiao, this is just Xiao Han Ying's personal guess.

546
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Don't get agitated.

547
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
Wait.

548
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
Listen to me first.

549
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Whether the phone call between Kong Xun Cha and Du Zu

550
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,760
is the one he leaked,

551
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
there is no guarantee of a connection.

552
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Unless you can get a complete call record,

553
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
find the relevant witness,

554
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
and the evidence that proves that it was his phone call,

555
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
it is important to leak the information to Pika.

556
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
You are right.

557
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Did you find the car?

558
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Yes.

559
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
The car was badly damaged.

560
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
The witness team has checked the car.

561
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
The car hasn't been maintained.

562
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,760
But it was used frequently before Du Guosheng was arrested.

563
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Basically, all the foreign officials have touched it.

564
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
If it's the car,

565
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
everyone in our team is suspicious.

566
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
I think we should find out as soon as possible

567
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
the motive behind Du Zu's attention to this matter.

568
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
And if that car is related to him.

569
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
If it's...

570
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Xiao Han Ying,

571
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
evidence?

572
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Do you know who you are accusing?

573
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,760
You have found the evidence.

574
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
I will send it to you online.

575
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Otherwise,

576
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
we can pretend that we didn't hear this today.

577
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
When Kong Weicheng was buried,

578
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
you have to kowtow to him.

579
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
And apologize to him.

580
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Otherwise, Tao Ze will not let you off.

581
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Say something.

582
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
I...

583
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I want to see Tao Fu.

584
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Okay?

585
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Go.

586
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Xiao Qiao, don't dream.

587
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
You stay in the hospital.

588
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Keep an eye on Lin Ming.

589
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,760
No matter if he is a fool or a bad person.

590
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
No matter what,

591
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
nothing can happen.

592
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Wait.

593
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Don't hold your hand.

594
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Go and apply for a leave.

595
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Apply for a leave.

596
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Yes.

597
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Impossible.

598
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Impossible.

599
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Xiao Han Ying is doing things

600
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
without thinking or intuition.

601
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Even Wei Zhan Hong doesn't know

602
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
who is behind her.

603
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Now I can only point at Lin Ming

604
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,760
after he wakes up.

605
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
But even if he points at her,

606
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
he is the same person.

607
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
He is talking nonsense.

608
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Du Zu...

609
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Du Zu...

610
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
Senior, you know Du Zu earlier than me.

611
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
What kind of person do you think Du Zu is?

612
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
I don't know.

613
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Du Zu is an old man.

614
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
He is older than you.

615
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
He is a high-ranking officer.

616
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
He is a very important person.

617
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
He has many prisoners in prison.

618
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
He even dreams of killing him.

619
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
When I joined the special investigation team,

620
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I participated in a case of arresting Tao.

621
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
A new criminal was released.

622
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
I saw him at night.

623
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I went to his house to find him and get revenge.

624
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Do you know how the knife came on his face?

625
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
That's how it came.

626
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
Fortunately, he escaped quickly.

627
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
If that knife had used some more force...

628
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I...

629
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Am I crazy?

630
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Why would I kill him?

631
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
He wouldn't do that.

632
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
And...

633
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
And I don't know what he said on the phone.

634
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
What did he say?

635
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,760
But why did he call Kong Wei Cheng at that time?

636
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
He doesn't know how sensitive this is.

637
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Senior,

638
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,760
have you ever heard

639
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
how the lives of two worlds look like

640
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
when they are together?

641
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,760
If an ant lives in a paper all its life,

642
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
when I walk into it,

643
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,760
the ants can't see us

644
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,760
because of the dimensions.

645
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
They can only feel the huge shadow

646
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,760
we put on the paper.

647
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
They can't see it.

648
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
In fact, we don't want to hurt them.

649
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,760
In fact, people usually behave like this.

650
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
We can only see one person's behavior.

651
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
But the motivation behind this behavior

652
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
is hard to imagine.

653
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
The habit of one person's behavior

654
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,760
is hard to change.

655
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
It's hard to pretend.

656
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Senior, you know Mr. Du.

657
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
You said

658
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
these are not evidence.

659
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Why would you let an action

660
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
that doesn't know the motivation

661
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,760
interfere with your judgment?

662
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
You are right.

663
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,760
I'm confused.

664
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
Senior, you are worried about the consequences.

665
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
You grew up in light.

666
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,760
You are the one

667
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
who is the most important person

668
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,760
in the world.

669
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,760
You are the one

670
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,760
who is the most important person

671
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,760
in the world.

672
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
You are the one

673
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,760
who grew up in light.

674
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,760
It's not easy for you to accept

675
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,760
the betrayal of the people around you.

676
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
Unlike me,

677
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,760
I'm used to it.

678
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,760
Senior, do you know

679
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
what kind of feeling this is?

680
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Whether it's the relationship between

681
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
Kong Weicheng and Du Zu

682
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
or the conversation between them

683
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
before they arrested Ling Ling,

684
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,760
these are all too easy to investigate

685
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,760
and too obvious.

686
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,760
It's like someone deliberately

687
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
put the evidence in front of you.

688
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,760
Let the person suspect the person

689
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,760
and then the witness is dead.

690
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,760
The evidence is one by one

691
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,760
and the witness will appear

692
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,760
according to the order.

693
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,760
Think about it.

694
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,760
This is exactly the same

695
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,760
as the fire and fire case

696
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,760
ten years ago.

697
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,760
It's like a reenactment.

698
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
Everything that happens in the world

699
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
will leave a mark.

700
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
Instead of being influenced by emotions

701
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
and being unable to advance,

702
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
we might as well start from the current clues.

703
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,760
This is the reason why

704
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,760
you and Senior

705
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
are the first to be connected.

706
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
I'll go and wake up

707
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
the only clue we have.

708
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Is it too late?

709
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,760
If there's no clue

710
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
that can be accepted by the core members of the organization,

711
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,760
we might as well change our mind.

712
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,760
What do you mean?

713
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,760
Do you remember the case

714
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,760
of the contract in May?

715
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,760
At that time,

716
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I was in your office

717
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,760
and was under interrogation.

718
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Cooperate with the investigation.

719
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,760
Cooperate with the investigation.

720
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Okay.

721
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Cooperate with the investigation.

722
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,760
At that time, I began to suspect

723
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,760
that the hot topic of this case

724
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,760
was strange.

725
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
You mean

726
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
we should start from the beginning?

727
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,760
Start from the beginning.

728
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,760
Following these clues,

729
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,760
we should start from the beginning.

730
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Let me help you recall.

731
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
In May,

732
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,760
after the murder of Master Zhou

733
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,760
and the case of the contract,

734
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,760
the investigation was carried out.

735
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
The investigation was carried out.

736
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Jin Zai Hong was guilty.

737
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
He was afraid that if he was to be the murderer,

738
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
the murderer would be the real reason

739
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,760
for the murderer to choose

740
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
the Golden Triangle.

741
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
That's why Cui Hong Liang

742
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
insisted

743
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,760
to make the case

744
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
a familiar case.

745
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,760
A familiar case?

746
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,760
It's definitely a familiar case.

747
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
But even if the case was small,

748
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,760
until Miao Xiao Gui showed up,

749
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
he said that the conspiracy of the case

750
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
was a conspiracy of the ghost.

751
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Plus, his drug addiction,

752
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,760
he was destined to be in trouble.

753
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,760
It's like someone

754
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
deliberately

755
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
made that place

756
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,760
a place of private affairs

757
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
and killed him in front of you.

758
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
And then there's Chen Zhen.

759
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
I still don't understand

760
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
why he

761
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,760
broke into the Hong Fu Grand Hall that night.

762
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Why did Jin Zai Hong

763
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,760
have to kill him

764
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,760
when I was rushing over?

765
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,760
Unless...

766
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Unless Chen Zhen

767
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
wasn't killed by Jin Zai Hong.

768
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
He was...

769
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,760
A car.

770
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
A car.

771
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,760
There should be

772
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,760
a companion

773
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,760
in the Hong Fu Grand Hall

774
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,760
that night.

775
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,760
He gave me

776
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,760
a warning sign.

777
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,760
He arranged a room

778
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,760
with a secret window

779
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,760
to make sure that

780
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Jin Zai Hong would escape

781
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,760
when he was in danger.

782
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
He was a witness

783
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
to everything in the Hong Fu Grand Hall.

784
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,760
The last person

785
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,760
in this case

786
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
was the one who sent

787
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
a message to He Zong Yu

788
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,760
and changed the message

789
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
to Jin San Jiao.

790
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,760
I thought it was

791
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
Zhou Hong Chuan who sent the message.

792
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,760
But that number

793
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,760
is obviously not the same.

794
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,760
It does sound like

795
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
the message of the person who sent it.

796
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
If it wasn't for this message,

797
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
Zhou Hong Chuan

798
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
wouldn't have been so sure

799
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,760
about He Zong Yu's identity.

800
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Maybe

801
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,760
he wouldn't have committed

802
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,760
the next murder.

803
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,760
The second case.

804
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,760
The case of the Su family's

805
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,760
girl who betrayed her.

806
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
There is

807
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
only one explanation for this case.

808
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,760
Who told the police

809
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,760
and led Su Ruowan

810
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,760
to imitate the signature

811
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,760
of Su Linai?

812
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,760
And then there is

813
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
the case of Zhou Shi.

814
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,760
Zheng Kaifeng

815
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
had the name of Zhou Huai Jin

816
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
and connected with Dong Xian

817
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,760
and murdered Zhou Jun Hao.

818
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,760
All of these are correct.

819
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
But if we want to

820
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
burn Dong Xiao Qing

821
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
into the contract of the murderer,

822
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,760
he was attacked,

823
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,760
killed Zhou Huai Jin,

824
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,760
and killed by Wang Li.

825
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
If all of these

826
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
are because of him,

827
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
it would be too strange.

828
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,760
From the motive of murdering Zhou Huai Jin,

829
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,760
Zheng Kaifeng is indeed

830
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,760
very suspicious.

831
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
But the way is not like him.

832
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,760
After all, the clothes he could buy

833
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,760
could be more safe and more reliable

834
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,760
than the long-term operation

835
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,760
of an ordinary woman.

836
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
Wang Li killed Dong Xiao Qing

837
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
and directly exposed him.

838
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
There are many cases

839
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
where Wang Li killed Dong Xiao Qing

840
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
and directly exposed him.

841
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Someone made a fake car accident

842
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,760
and made a murder case.

843
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
So,

844
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
the fake courier

845
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
who was missing

846
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
and the one who took Dong Xiao Qing's phone

847
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
and sent a text to Xiao Han Yang

848
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,760
and sneaked into Dong Xiao Qing's house

849
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,760
and made a fire,

850
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,760
and even hired and murdered

851
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,760
Wang Li,

852
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,760
are all their people.

853
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,760
They may be different people.

854
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
It is also possible

855
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,760
that they are the same person.

856
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,760
Finally,

857
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
it is Feng Bin's case.

858
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,760
First, it is A13

859
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
who hid in the organization's cleaning factory

860
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,760
and planned the whole case.

861
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
Finally, Wei Wen Xuan explained

862
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,760
that he did not want to kill Feng Bin,

863
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,760
but wanted to find a hitter

864
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
to teach him a lesson.

865
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
But A13 did not tell Du Guosheng

866
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
like that.

867
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,760
He asked Du Guosheng to kill Feng Bin

868
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,760
and left Xia Xin Nan

869
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,760
and himself

870
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,760
as the rightful S.A.P.

871
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
Finally, it is the fake security of Long Yun Cheng.

872
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,760
He specifically edited the surveillance video

873
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,760
twice

874
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,760
and left Du Guosheng's face

875
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,760
so that we could find Feng Chao.

876
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
And it is Zou Feng.

877
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,760
The waitress, courier, cleaning worker, security.

878
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,760
These are indeed

879
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,760
the most easily let people

880
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,760
put down the guards.

881
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,760
It is also a group of people

882
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:01,840
who can not see the traces of the

883
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,760
And the target of these people is

884
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
those who are in the same group.

885
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
They are going to kill

886
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
those who have been

887
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
in the same group

888
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,760
in Xinzhou.

889
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,760
The first three cases

890
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,760
they hid in the case

891
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,760
and did not leave any traces.

892
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,760
It is like a group

893
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,760
that can not see the traces of the mystery.

894
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:40,760
I think there is a feeling

895
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
that it is about to be

896
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,760
the time for them to draw a line.

897
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,760
If this is their purpose,

898
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,760
who will remember

899
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,760
a case from ten years ago?

900
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,760
In fact, I have a clue.

901
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
It should be the news in a few days.

902
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,760
I am not sure

903
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,760
if Feng Chao is the one who killed the guard.

904
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

905
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

906
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

907
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

908
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

909
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

910
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

911
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

912
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

913
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

914
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

915
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

916
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

917
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

918
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

919
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

920
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

921
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

922
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

923
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

924
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

925
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

926
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

927
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

928
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

929
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

930
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

931
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

932
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

933
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

934
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

935
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

936
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
I think he is the one who killed the guard.

937
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,760
