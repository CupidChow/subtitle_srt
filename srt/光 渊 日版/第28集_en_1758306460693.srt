1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You

8
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I saw

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I saw

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I saw

11
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Senior

12
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why are you here?

13
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Pian Su, are you a human?

14
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you want to live, you can't

15
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you have to kill yourself?

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know

17
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know

18
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know

19
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know

20
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't know

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know

24
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
I don't know

31
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Look at that

33
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We caught Zou Fong together

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He left us with his submission��

35
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is the fake key to the Red Vest.

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He's taken the key to the bag.

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It seems that there's a reason for the first case

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in Zofeng's plan to lead the army.

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The invaders are eager to get the organization out of here.

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you're going to say something,

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know something's wrong.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Did someone contact you?

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Who?

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The invaders or the organization?

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The invaders.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Doctor Zhang,

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
what did the invaders' plan, Pei Shisan,

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ask you to do?

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What they asked me to do is not important.

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What they said is more important.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They've always been very confident and very secretive.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But this time,

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
they revealed a very important information.

54
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
When I was hypnotized,

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
although I couldn't see the invader,

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I could clearly feel that

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
he was sitting in the whole city.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've always ignored my memory.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
At that time, my height was only about 1.6 meters.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When I was pulled out by Pei Shisan from the cabinet,

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
he came to my front door.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I looked at him.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He was sitting on the chair.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I was very surprised.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Brother,

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
help me to sleep.

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We only have one step away from the truth.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,960
The

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
They called him teacher.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've seen him and forgot about him.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He has a disability, so I'm sorry I can't come personally.

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,340
I don't know if he's a ghost or a

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I must find him this time.

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't believe in you.

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Go.

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't say it.

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now you can say it.

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You didn't do it on purpose.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Say it.

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't believe in you.

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't believe in you.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Say it.

83
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You don't say it, do you?

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mom.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Mom.

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Mom.

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Pei Su,

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
come to me.

89
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're tired.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't pursue the truth.

91
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What's the benefit of removing that scar?

92
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why do you make yourself so painful?

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Pei Su,

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you're tired.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Pei Su,

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it's all fake.

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Pei Su,

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you've fed them too well.

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just a grave.

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They're not satisfied with the knife in your hand.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Pei Su,

102
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
where are you going?

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Come to mom.

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Pei Su.

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Pei Su,

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
you're too tired.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You need to rest.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Pei Su,

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
come to mom.

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Pei Su,

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you're too tired.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Where are you going?

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Pei Su, help me.

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Help.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Pei Su.

116
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Pei Su.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Pei Su,

119
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
a cat likes to hide.

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Pei Su,

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
are you a cat?

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Pei Su,

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
what did you hear?

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Good kids shouldn't eavesdrop on adults.

125
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You didn't do it on purpose, right?

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What did you hear?

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Speak!

129
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You won't tell me?

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I know who did it.

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Pei Su,

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you can't run away from me.

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't.

134
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Little boy,

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you can't just run away.

136
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:29,060
Come on, get it on!

137
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:37,260
Come on!

138
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,100
There.

139
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Hot.

140
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,700
yea.

141
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,620
don't

142
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,620
Don't kill me. I beg you.

143
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,060
to

144
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,060
的

145
00:13:43,060 --> 00:14:07,620
Yes draftable.

146
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,620
原来你是被上天选中的幸运儿啊。 You are the lucky one chosen by the heavens.

147
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,620
你可真是个怪物。 You are a monster.

148
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,620
未来合作愉快。 I hope we can work together in the future.

149
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,620
白色。 White color.

150
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
白色。 White color.

151
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
不要被他们控制。 Don't be controlled by them.

152
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
妈妈知道。 Mom knows.

153
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
你是个善良的孩子。 You are a kind child.

154
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
一直都是。 Always.

155
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
记得妈妈给你念的那句话。 Remember the words I told you.

156
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,620
不自由。 Not freedom.

157
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
我宁死。 I'd rather die.

158
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,620
妈妈。 Mom.

159
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
妈妈。 Mom.

160
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,620
当我醒了。 When I am done.

161
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,620
我的心都在悲哀。 I know my soul is so weary.

162
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,620
当麻烦来到了。 When troubles come.

163
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,620
让我的心变得更疼痛。 Let my heart be more painful.

164
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,620
当我还在。 When I am still.

165
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,620
我在静静的睡觉中。 I'm awake in the silence.

166
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,620
直到你醒来。 Until you come.

167
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,620
让我好好地照顾你。 Let me be well.

168
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,620
你带我上去。 You raise me up.

169
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,620
让我能看到你的眼睛。 So I can see your eyes.

170
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
你带我上去。 You raise me up.

171

你和他和他们不一样。 You are different from them.

00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
你要记住。 Remember.

174
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
无论到什么时候。 No matter what happens.

175
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,620
都不要让自己成为他人手里伤害别人的工具。 Never let yourself be a tool for others to hurt others.

176
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
妈妈也一样。 Mom is the same.

177
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,620
我也不能成为陪着你伤害你训练你的工具。 I can't be a companion to hurt you and train you.

178
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,620
你带我上去。 You raise me up.

179
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,620
我知道你是个善良的孩子。 So I can see your eyes.

180
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,620
你带我上去。 You raise me up.

181
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,620
我知道你是个善良的孩子。 So I can see your eyes.

182
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:29,620
我知道你是个善良的孩子。 So I can see your eyes.

183
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:41,620
爱不成爱不成。 I will save my love.

184
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,620
爱不成爱不成。 I will save my love.

185
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,620
爱不成爱不成。 I will save my love.

186
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,620
对不起。对不起。 I'm sorry, Bei Su.

187
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,620
你能原谅妈妈吗? Can you forgive me?

188
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,620
梦中眼睛不敢多看一眼的梦。 I can't see the same person in my dreams.

189
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,620
我是你。你是我。 I am you. You are me.

190
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,620
上天长久的身影最长的底。 The longest body in the sky is the longest bottom.

191
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:51,620
却过不识过。那花殷随处落了。 The flower has fallen. The flower has fallen.

192
00:20:52,620 --> 00:21:06,620
在各地悬坠落。在雨水分开一颗。 In each land, the rain falls. In each land, the wind blows.

193
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,620
四张头并藏着我。四张头并藏着我。 Four hairs are hidden behind my head.

194
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,620
人间稍微铁壳。 The world is still small.

195
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,620
伤口不愿失落。 The wound is not willing to be lost.

196
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:35,620
赦风化成黑色。 The wind turns black.

197
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
嫂嫂。嫂嫂。 A'登。 A'登.

198
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
别走! Don't go!

199
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Oh

200
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,100
What

201
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,620
Don't think about it.

202
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Don't force yourself.

203
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
I saw her.

204
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,620
She is...

205
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,620
Fan Si Yuan.

206
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,420
The

207
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,620
Are you sure that person you remember is her?

208
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
Where did she come from?

209
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
You knew it.

210
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
I just suspect that person.

211
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,620
But I have no evidence.

212
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Dad, I want to look into the first 0 degree plan.

213
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,620
I found that the first 0 degree plan was not written by Pan Yue Hong.

214
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Don't tell me.

215
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
I need your help.

216
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Is there a criminal psychology institute in Xinzhou University of Law?

217
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,620
I want the original material of this institute.

218
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,620
But the founder of this institute is...

219
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
Fan Si Yuan.

220
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,620
The first 0 degree plan

221
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,620
So she is the soul of the first 0 degree plan.

222
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Pan Yue Hong's teacher.

223
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
I don't know.

224
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
After Huo Xiao came to the special investigation team,

225
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
she used to study at Xinzhou University of Law.

226
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
But I guess it was her.

227
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,620
So she started the first 0 degree plan after Huo Xiao's death.

228
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
I think so.

229
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
So the Huo Xiao case is a starting point.

230
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,620
She thinks the first 0 degree plan killed her most talented student.

231
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
She thinks she did her best to study it.

232
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,620
The genes decided to find the evidence in the real world.

233
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,620
And she kept on writing to the first 0 degree plan.

234
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
She didn't want them to have a negative feeling.

235
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
Finally found the clue.

236
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,620
What a fool.

237
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,620
So I have a question.

238
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
If as Yang said, this person is gone.

239
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Who is leading the group?

240
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,620
Or...

241
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
Senior.

242
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
Is this crazy guy really dead?

243
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
They didn't catch him.

244
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Before they caught him, Fan Si Yuan disappeared.

245
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
At the same time, the group received a report.

246
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,620
They said Fan Si Yuan was once in the ice mountain.

247
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
They almost caught him.

248
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
During the arrest, Fan Si Yuan jumped into the sea.

249
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
Blood was left on the rock.

250
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,620
But the body was never found.

251
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
When did this happen?

252
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,620
7 years ago.

253
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
7 years ago?

254
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,620
7 years ago?

255
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
What?

256
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
I was thinking which year I saw him.

257
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,620
You know.

258
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,620
I killed myself.

259
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
7 years ago.

260
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,620
What was the season when you saw him?

261
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,620
7 years ago.

262
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,620
7 years ago.

263
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,620
Qingming Festival.

264
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Qingming Festival?

265
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Yes.

266
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
Pei Cheng Yu wouldn't let my mom go out.

267
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,500
When it's the Chinese New Year, my mom will be in the backyard

268
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
secretly worshiping my grandpa.

269
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,020
She definitely won't leave.

270
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,220
Senior, when is the time for Fan Siyuan to jump into the sea?

271
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,420
When she's out of the cave.

272
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
After the bomb is dropped.

273
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
So...

274
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
she really didn't die.

275
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,220
Recently, supporters of the financial inspection bill

276
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
have been going to the center of the city to protest.

277
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,620
Apparently, after the recent case of the evil case

278
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,620
of the Chinese New Year,

279
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
the people's nerves have been tight.

280
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Maybe soon,

281
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
we will hear the news of the financial inspection bill.

282
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,620
Teacher, the person who sent you has met Pei Su.

283
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,620
The message has been received.

284
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
But he said

285
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Pei Su is a wolf-like man.

286
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,620
He's unreliable.

287
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
He's never reliable.

288
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
But it's not necessary.

289
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
It can't be used.

290
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
After so many years,

291
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,620
our plan is finally going to be completed.

292
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
These monsters

293
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
will soon

294
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
have no place to hide.

295
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
It's time

296
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
to attack them.

297
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,440
The

298
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
Chinese New Year

299
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
is coming.

300
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,620
A few years ago,

301
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
Fan Si Yuan escaped from the ice sea.

302
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
The organization found him

303
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
and took him in.

304
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
He discovered them because of the fire.

305
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
He was guilty of revenge.

306
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,620
He was very careful.

307
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
He put his own people in it.

308
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
He met Pei Cheng Yu.

309
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
He thought he could use him.

310
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
He used Pei's financials

311
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
to understand the organization.

312
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
But he was not satisfied with the organization

313
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
because of the plan.

314
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
He was the most unprepared person.

315
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
He got Pei Cheng Yu's trust.

316
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
He used Pei Cheng Yu

317
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
to control the organization.

318
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
He made a plan to subdue the organization.

319
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
But the plan was exposed in advance.

320
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Then,

321
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
Pei Cheng Yu was hit by a plant.

322
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,620
He took the cleaners and fell into the dark.

323
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,620
He was in the dark for three years.

324
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
He wanted to use the case

325
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,620
to incite the public's emotions.

326
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
He promoted the gene test plan

327
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,620
and pulled out people from all sides.

328
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
He eliminated the guilty people they thought were guilty.

329
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
He was in the dark until the fire was put out.

330
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
He pointed out the best old man.

331
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
No matter who the best old man is,

332
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
I don't think they will be able to do anything.

333
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
I will not leave.

334
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
I am a vice president of a two-state company.

335
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
My surname is Su.

336
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,620
I went to Dongyue for business these days.

337
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,620
Then, after Pei Cheng Yu was hit,

338
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,620
the public health fund stopped operating.

339
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
These days, I have been paying back

340
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
to a client in Dongyue.

341
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,620
He didn't run away.

342
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,620
You have always known?

343
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
How did you know about Zou Feng's case?

344
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,620
It was the first case of the 0 degree plan.

345
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,620
Pei Su.

346
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
I guessed it.

347
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
When I was testing this case,

348
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
I saw that Mr. Pan had studied the theory of this case

349
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
from the perspective of the criminal.

350
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
I knew that he was not a good person.

351
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
I have studied the theory of this case from the perspective of the criminal.

352
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
Then, when the 0 degree plan was transferred to the old case,

353
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
I drew it out.

354
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,620
At that time, I guessed that

355
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,620
this was the old case that I had studied

356
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
in the first 0 degree plan.

357
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,620
I didn't expect that I guessed it right.

358
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,620
You just said that

359
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
after Pei Cheng Yu was hit,

360
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
the public health fund stopped operating.

361
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
What does this mean?

362
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,620
Why do you emphasize on Pei Cheng Yu?

363
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,620
What do they want to do?

364
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Hello, Mr. Pei.

365
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
Hello, Dad.

366
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
The person behind the 3rd case and the case

367
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
has been found.

368
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
It's Pei Cheng Yu.

369
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
The investigation team wants Pei Su

370
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,620
to cooperate with the investigation.

371
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,620
You should return to the special investigation team as soon as possible.

372
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
It seems that

373
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
Pei Cheng Yu is going to take the blame now.

374
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
Nonsense!

375
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Pei Cheng Yu has been a person for 3 years!

376
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,620
But when Liang Wan Yuan called,

377
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Pei Cheng Yu disappeared.

378
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,620
And even if he died by accident,

379
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
I was still there for the 3 years.

380
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
I'll go upstairs to call him.

381
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,620
I'll go upstairs to call him.

382
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
With one person,

383
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,620
You can leave,

384
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
do house chores,

385
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
and discuss housework.

386
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,620
OK?

387
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Stop.

388
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Did you mean this?

389
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
I'mthe third victim,

390
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
and you're the last victim?

391
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
If not,

392
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
what is your father like?

393
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
Carbon的話嗎?

394
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Captain Fu.

396
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
Let's pick up Mr. Pei.

397
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
We'll go back to cooperate with the investigation.

398
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Senior.

399
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
I'll go with them.

400
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,620
You don't go.

401
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
I'll talk to the surveillance.

402
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
I'm fine.

403
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
Since they asked me to go with them,

404
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
now I'll go with the surveillance.

405
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
It's the safest option.

406
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,620
We should trust the?

407
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Isn't it?

408
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
Senior.

411
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,620
Senior.

412
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,620
The storm is very important to us.

413
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Since they left it to us,

414
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,620
it means that they must have some key clues that we haven't found.

415
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
And Zhou Yingchuan.

416
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
We haven't found the real connection between him and Su Fei.

417
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
And...

418
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
You'll take care of the vacation.

419
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Let's go.

420
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,620
By the way.

421
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
All my codes are...

422
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
I know.

423
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,620
It's the date of that day.

424
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,620
Captain Sui.

425
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
and was locked up in the mental hospital.

426
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,620
After the incident, you refused to believe SID's judgment.

427
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,620
You kept visiting all those who knew about the future,

428
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
trying to prove that Yu Bin's death was not an accident.

429
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,620
You persisted in your judgment for nearly 10 years,

430
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,620
until you finally had the chance to disguise as a caretaker

431
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
and sneak into the安定 hospital in the future.

432
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Ten minutes later, you were discovered by the nurse in the ward.

433
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,620
You took the knife and the murderer you thought killed your husband.

434
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
You were in a small ward,

435
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,620
and you were with him for 10 minutes.

436
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,620
According to the report, he didn't kill Yu Bin with one knife.

437
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,620
He cut him with eight knives and stabbed him with a knife.

438
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Why didn't you take the opportunity to take revenge?

439
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,620
Were you afraid?

440
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Or did you find out that the person who gave up everything for revenge

441
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
was just a coward?

442
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
I didn't! I didn't! I didn't!

443
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,620
So why did you let him go?

444
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
Because that person...

445
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,620
he wasn't the murderer who killed my husband.

446
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,620
That morning,

447
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
we went out together.

448
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
When we just separated,

449
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,620
I remembered that he had a class.

450
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
I didn't bring my keys.

451
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
I went back to look for him.

452
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,620
I heard someone screaming.

453
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,620
Then I saw

454
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,620
a man who was covered in blood,

455
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,620
and he was running over with a knife.

456
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,620
I was so confused.

457
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Then I realized

458
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
that the blood on his body

459
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620
was from my husband.

460
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,620
I...

461
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,620
The patrol team came soon.

462
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,620
That man was caught before he could take a few steps.

463
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,620
I thought my soldier could see clearly,

464
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
but I didn't expect

465
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,620
that man

466
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,620
was drunk because of mental disorder.

467
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,620
I didn't believe it. I didn't believe it at all.

468
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
Then

469
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,620
I sneaked into his ward.

470
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
I...

471
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
I was a nurse before.

472
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
I knew

473
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,620
that such symptoms

474
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
and diseases

475
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,620
couldn't be faked.

476
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,620
Then why did you say that he didn't kill him?

477
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,620
I didn't want to believe it.

478
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,620
I asked everyone who knew about the past.

479
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
They all said that

480
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
although he was a man,

481
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,620
he was very gentle.

482
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,620
He didn't have any violent tendencies.

483
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
My soldier caught him.

484
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,620
He said that he was unlucky.

485
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
I didn't believe it.

486
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
I wouldn't believe it at all.

487
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,620
How could it be so coincidental that my soldier caught him?

488
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620
That's your basis.

489
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,620
Do you think

490
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,620
I'm a fool?

491
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,620
I'm telling you.

492
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
I have evidence.

493
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,620
What evidence?

494
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,620
The teacher is right.

495
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,620
Even if he was mentally ill,

496
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,620
he might have been

497
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,620
instructed or framed.

498
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
This is a good proof.

499
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
How?

500
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
Proof?

501
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
It's simple.

502
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,620
If they really instructed Qian Cheng

503
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,620
to kill your husband,

504
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,620
if you go to him,

505
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,620
they will definitely think that

506
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
Qian Cheng has exposed himself

507
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
and will kill him immediately.

508
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
If you don't believe me,

509
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,620
you can try.

510
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,620
How did I find it?

511
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,620
I

512
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
came to help you.

513
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,620
The teacher is right.

514
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
Qian Cheng is dead.

515
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
Qian Cheng died

516
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
because of those who killed my husband.

517
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,620
They are the real killers.

518
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
They are the real killers.

519
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
Zeng Feng, who are they?

520
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,620
They are garbage.

521
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,620
They need to be cleaned.

522
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
Zeng Feng, who is going to kill Yu Bin?

523
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
Why?

524
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,620
What do you know?

525
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,620
You are garbage.

526
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,620
Xiao Qiao, get out.

527
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
Don't be so bold.

528
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,620
I want you out.

529
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,620
I came to clean you.

530
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,620
You will pay for it sooner or later.

531
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
You need to be cleaned.

532
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,620
You just wait to be cleaned.

533
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,620
You will pay for it.

534
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,620
You will pay for it.

535
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,620
You will pay for it.

536
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
You will pay for it.

537
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,620
You just wait.

538
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,620
You are the real killers.

539
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,620
You are the killers.

540
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,620
You will pay for it.

541
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,620
You will pay for it.

542
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,620
Why did you kill Zeng Feng?

543
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,620
To protect your teacher?

544
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
You are the real killers.

545
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
You don't cooperate with the investigation

546
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,620
of SID to protect your teacher.

547
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620
You don't even let your husband

548
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,620
continue to speak.

549
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,620
Do you think your teacher

550
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,620
is a good person?

551
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
What do you know?

552
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,620
For the sake of the interests of all my brothers and sisters,

553
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,620
he can wait for so long.

554
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,620
What am I afraid of?

555
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,620
I want you all to be avenged.

556
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,620
When you went to see Qian Cheng,

557
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,620
no one found him.

558
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,620
What are you talking about?

559
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,620
Your teacher just finished talking to you.

560
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,620
You went there.

561
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,620
Qian Cheng died.

562
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,620
How can it be so coincidental?

563
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,620
Have you ever doubted it?

564
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,620
Qian Cheng is a real mental patient.

565
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,620
Even if you go to see him,

566
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,620
it will lead to his exposure.

567
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,620
But for the organization behind him,

568
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,620
is it really that important

569
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,620
to kill him?

570
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,620
What are you talking about?

571
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,620
Don't forget one more thing.

572
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,620
Why didn't you run away

573
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,620
when you were caught?

574
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
Who sent the car to pick you up?

575
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,620
Who changed the key

576
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,620
into a fake one?

577
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,620
Do you really think your teacher

578
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,620
won't kill innocent people?

579
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,620
The End

580
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,620
The End

581
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,620
The End

582
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,620
The End

583
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,620
The End
