00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Episode 1

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,820
In her heart

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,160
there is a garden

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,980
A coldyah

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,720
a palace gate

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,140
A torrential area

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,140
And I, a man in dirty clothes,

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,140
who is always suffering,

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,140
was accidentally forbidden to enter this area.

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,140
The Red Sake

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,140
It's right ahead.

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,140
I've brought you your favorite red sake.

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,140
We'll drink and chat later.

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,140
Okay, let's drink and chat.

15
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,140
The Red Sake

16
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,140
The Red Sake

17
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
Pei Song

18
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,140
The Red Sake

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,140
I love you.

20
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,140
I'm a monster.

21
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,140
But I love you.

22
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm despicable and shameless.

23
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
I'm rude and rude.

24
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,140
And so on.

25
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,140
There were many times when I knew how you felt.

26
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
And knowing this,

27
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,140
it was so painful.

28
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,140
The Red Sake

29
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,140
The Red Sake

30
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,140
The Red Sake

31
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,140
The Red Sake

32
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,140
The Red Sake

33
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,140
The Red Sake

34
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Episode 2

35
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,140
The Red Sake

36
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,140
Search around, okay?

37
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,140
And compare these two fingerprints.

38
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,140
Send it to me as soon as possible.

39
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Okay.

40
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Okay.

41
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,140
And confirm

42
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,140
the victim and the other people.

43
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Okay.

44
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,140
And send me detailed information.

45
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Okay.

46
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
And these two.

47
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Okay.

48
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
Captain Luo, what's going on?

49
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
The students of the Kangxin Middle School in Xinzhou

50
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
came to the Xiling

51
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,140
to visit the former village.

52
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
They met the kidnappers on the way.

53
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
Then they followed the GPS system

54
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
of the kid's phone

55
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,140
to the crime scene.

56
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
The kidnappers were killed.

57
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,140
It's so easy to solve.

58
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,140
Why did you ask me to come here?

59
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,140
To clean up the battlefield?

60
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Because a kid disappeared.

61
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
I'll check the surroundings again.

62
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Okay.

63
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Captain Luo.

64
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Boss.

65
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
This is the record of today's visit.

66
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
The missing girl's name is Qu Tong.

67
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
She's 15 years old.

68
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
She's from Xiling.

69
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
After the accident,

70
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
she escaped from the car

71
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
while fighting with the kidnappers.

72
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Did the police report come out?

73
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Yes.

74
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
It's been four hours.

75
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,140
The patrol team has searched

76
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
the surrounding mountains

77
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
for 10 kilometers.

78
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
The last clue

79
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
is near the Suishi Road

80
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,140
about five kilometers from here.

81
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
Miss Qiao is on her way.

82
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
The kid disappeared

83
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
in 24 hours.

84
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
It's a golden time.

85
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,140
Xiao Yang, report to the police.

86
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Get some police officers here.

87
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Yes.

88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Wu,

89
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
contact the police

90
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,140
and the police station.

91
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
If you have any news,

92
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,140
report it to them.

93
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Tell Qiao

94
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
to send me the location of Suishi Road.

95
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I'll go there now.

96
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Yes.

97
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
It's so funny.

98
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
Yes.

99
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
A villa.

100
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Do you often come here to play?

101
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Yes.

102
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,140
We haven't played here.

103
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
It's mainly the East Lan City area.

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
It's a nice place.

105
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Captain Luo,

106
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
you are also involved in this.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140
A kid was lost

108
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
and transferred to us.

109
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,140
What are you doing here?

110
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,140
Watching the fun?

111
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
You didn't see it, Captain Luo.

112
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,140
It was too dangerous just now.

113
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
If it wasn't for our patrol team,

114
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,140
we would have won the man

115
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
and confused the criminals

116
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
to the point

117
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
that they formed

118
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
the situation

119
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
of catching mice and cats

120
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
and dreaming of catching bats.

121
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,140
Today,

122
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,140
it's over.

123
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Translate it.

124
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
We have a racing club

125
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,140
in Xiling Mountain.

126
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,140
We just left the car today.

127
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
I didn't expect

128
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
to encounter this kind of thing.

129
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
The manager asked us to cooperate.

130
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
So we

131
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
acted out our performance.

132
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
You can catch the criminals

133
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
even if you are in a car.

134
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,140
Should I

135
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
give you a prize

136
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140
and send you off?

137
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
No need.

138
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
Captain Luo,

139
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
don't be so polite.

140
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,140
We are not related.

141
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
We are family.

142
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
We are family.

143
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
I haven't thanked you

144
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
for the last time.

145
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,140
Is there anything else?

146
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
Just a word from you.

147
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Who is your family?

148
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Brother Dong Lan,

149
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
I just heard from an investigator

150
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,140
that there is a girl

151
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
who hasn't been found.

152
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
The child is lost?

153
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Yes.

154
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
If there is such a thing,

155
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,140
I must go to the scene.

156
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
If intelligence can't keep up,

157
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
we have to help with physical work.

158
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
So many cars are not needed.

159
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Right, Captain Luo?

160
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
If the child is lost,

161
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
we have to help to find it.

162
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
Yes, we have to.

163
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
We have to.

164
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
We have to.

165
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,140
OK.

166
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,140
The car

167
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
really lost a little girl.

168
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
Send the photo to the police.

169
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
Send it to me.

170
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
Captain Luo and the police

171
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,140
are our own business.

172
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Find your child.

173
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,140
Let's go.

174
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,140
OK.

175
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
OK.

176
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Boss,

177
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
let's go over there first.

178
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Right here.

179
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,140
I have already shown it to the parents.

180
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
This shoe bag

181
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
is the decoration on the shoe of Qu Tong Liang.

182
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
You can't take it.

183
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,140
Don't come out.

184
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
That person is my boss.

185
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
I know you.

186
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,140
You can't take it.

187
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,140
Don't come out.

188
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,140
Don't come out.

189
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,140
The car is on the side.

190
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Let's go.

191
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,140
OK.

192
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,140
OK.

193
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,140
OK.

194
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
OK.

195
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
OK.

196
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
OK.

197
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
OK.

198
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
OK.

199
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
OK.

200
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
OK.

201
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
OK.

202
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
OK.

203
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
OK.

204
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I will go to the car and find it.

205
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,140
OK.

206
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,140
OK.

207
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,580
Her structural structure faces against the horizon misfire

208
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,780
· My heartummer pain

209
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,140
· I almost wanted to die

210
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,380
They might get hurt

211
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,660
I'm here now

212
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,300
Seriously

213
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,820
This place...

214
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,620
I don't care

215
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,620
It's good news, right?

216
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,020
After all, it just rained

217
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,420
There is a mountain area here

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
The mud is loose

219
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,620
There may be a safety hazard

220
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,020
Someone passed by here

221
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,220
Save that girl

222
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,020
At least tonight

223
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,620
She doesn't have to spend the night in the wilderness

224
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,420
Is it a wish or a forced one?

225
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,220
It's still a position now

226
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,820
Could it be

227
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
Don't be ridiculous

228
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,020
The witnesses came to see

229
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
See if there are any traces

230
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,220
Judging

231
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,820
Is the child willing to follow

232
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,620
Near the close attention

233
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,420
Did you find the child and report it?

234
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,020
And

235
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Go to contact

236
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
The children went to the abandoned park today

237
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,820
Check today's visitors

238
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,820
And the surveillance of the nearby roads

239
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,820
Take a closer look

240
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,020
All the vehicles passing by

241
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,020
Special attention

242
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,420
Single male car accident

243
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Increase search power

244
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,020
Remember to be on time

245
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,620
Yes

246
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,820
Captain Lu

247
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,820
When the girl passed away

248
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,340
Do you also wear a

249
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,220
math pillow?

250
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,220
A few days ago

251
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,540
A young woman died in a Embankment地

252
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,620
The girl bought a small Brilliance

253
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,200
High School Short School

254
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
SID rounds

255
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,420
Immediately run an emergency pre-ompounding

256
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
The missing child is now in contact with the missing child.

257
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,420
At this time, the distance from the missing child is over 24 hours.

258
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,420
As everyone knows, 24 hours is the golden time for the missing child.

259
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,420
Every minute, the child is more secure.

260
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I don't know who put it there.

261
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,420
I don't know when it was put there.

262
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
It was in our milk carton.

263
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
We can't find the child.

264
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,420
We don't have a story for this day.

265
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
Today, when Mrs. Song knocked on the door of our house,

266
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
I opened the milk carton.

267
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,420
One thing fell.

268
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,420
What's in here?

269
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,420
The missing child's body.

270
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,420
What's in here?

271
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,420
It's a recording.

272
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
We have too many clues now.

273
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
We shouldn't have thought of it.

274
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,420
But I heard Lao Yang mention Lianhua Mountain for the most of my life.

275
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,420
I have a deep impression.

276
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,420
So I have to find you to confirm it.

277
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,420
The missing girl, Qu Tong, is very similar to the victim of the Lianhua Mountain case.

278
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,420
When she was missing, she was wearing a broken dress.

279
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
After she was missing, no one came to search.

280
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
But they sent us a recording of an unknown case.

281
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
This is the recording?

282
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
Yes. Qu Tong's parents sent it to us.

283
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
It's a case from 16 years ago.

284
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,420
We all read it in the hall.

285
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,420
You are the director.

286
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Do you think this recording is similar to the phone call

287
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,420
the kidnappers called the victim's parents?

288
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,420
The case of Lianhua Mountain was very chaotic.

289
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,420
But now we can find the reports of the same kind in the newspaper.

290
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,420
But there is a detail that we never revealed.

291
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,420
I remember the missing girl was the one your teacher received the report.

292
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,420
The victim's parents mentioned something when they were working on the investigation.

293
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
I heard my daughter's pencil case on the phone.

294
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
It must be the kidnappers.

295
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Do you think you heard it wrong?

296
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
I didn't hear it wrong.

297
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Don't be excited.

298
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
Take your time.

299
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
Lingling.

300
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,420
She killed a colorful little girl.

301
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
She put it in the pencil case.

302
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,420
She likes to shake the pencil case.

303
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
Listen.

304
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
She is my daughter.

305
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
I won't make a mistake.

306
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,420
The victim's parents admitted that the recording is their daughter.

307
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Of course, this is just a small detail.

308
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,420
There was no sound evidence left at that time.

309
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,420
Only the victim's parents' testimony.

310
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
No wonder.

311
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,420
It's not mentioned in my master's notebook.

312
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,420
The special investigation team wouldn't tell such a small detail.

313
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,420
Could it be that the case was really killed the wrong person?

314
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,420
The murderer came out again after more than ten years.

315
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Such a serial killer.

316
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,420
It's impossible to stop your desire to kill for no reason.

317
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
If the murderer was really wrong.

318
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
He has been enough to kill a thousand people in the past ten years.

319
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,420
So I think he should be a zero-degree accomplice.

320
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Director Du.

321
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Why do you think Wu Guangcheng is the suspect in this serial kidnapping case?

322
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,420
Is it because of the clothes of the children in his hands?

323
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,420
No.

324
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,420
In addition to those clothes that were cut into pieces.

325
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Wu Guangcheng is the main reason for the suspect.

326
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
There are seven other girls.

327
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,420
And there are traces of abuse on his body.

328
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
And after he woke up.

329
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
He directly pointed to Wu Guangcheng.

330
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,420
That girl's name is Su...

331
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
Su Linan.

332
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Yes.

333
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
That's the name.

334
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,420
It's been too long.

335
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,420
I can't remember a lot of things.

336
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
You can go to the file.

337
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
I'm going to the file room now.

338
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Director Du.

339
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Actually, I have an idea.

340
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,420
Now the investigation of the kidnapping case has entered a calm.

341
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Whether you track the recording of the recording.

342
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Or check the school bus and follow the car.

343
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
That's all like digging a needle in the sea.

344
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
There is no difference.

345
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
I suggest we change the dead.

346
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
From the old case 16 years ago.

347
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
Combined investigation.

348
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,420
You mean restart the investigation.

349
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,420
But this case has long been a change of direction.

350
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Although the suspect is dead.

351
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
But the missing girl still has no trace.

352
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,420
The testimony of the single survivor may also be investigated.

353
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
And the case now.

354
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,420
It's not just the characteristics of the suspect.

355
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Even the details of the case like the bell in the pencil box.

356
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
Not the relevant person of the case.

357
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
Or the deep participant.

358
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
It's impossible to understand so clearly.

359
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
According to these evidences.

360
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
The missing girl in Xiling Mountain District.

361
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
It's definitely not a coincidence.

362
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
The person who kidnapped and kidnapped the girl.

363
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
It's very likely that it's a person who didn't catch her.

364
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
The one who contributed to the 0 degree.

365
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
Wei Zhao.

366
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,420
What expectations do the special investigation team have in Xinzhou?

367
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
Do you understand?

368
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Once it's done.

369
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
No matter what you did wrong.

370
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,420
It's the honor of the whole special investigation team.

371
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
If it fails.

372
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
We won't fail.

373
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
Okay.

374
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,420
I will explain the situation to the inspection team.

375
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Wei Zhao.

376
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,420
From now on, it's your world.

377
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
We are all old.

378
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,420
We have no one left.

379
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Only me left to take you guys.

380
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
I'm not far from retirement.

381
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
Retirement is not good.

382
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
I dream about retirement every day.

383
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,420
I can talk about natural awakening every day.

384
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Take my wife around the world.

385
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
The grandchildren who go out to take the subway.

386
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
I have to let them do it.

387
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Get lost.

388
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
You don't even have a young wife.

389
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
If you don't talk, I'll throw you out.

390
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Okay.

391
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
Yes.

392
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
I'll throw you out.

393
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
Good boy.

394
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
Listen, everyone.

395
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
What I'm going to bring you next is.

396
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,420
The famous national treasure of reading.

397
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,420
The winner of the award.

398
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
The winner of the award.

399
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,420
He can be discolored.

400
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
He can be withered.

401
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,420
He can do anything.

402
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
But I just want to look at him.

403
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,420
He is so tender.

404
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
It's always on my mind.

405
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
No matter how hard Hengbo Te tries.

406
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,420
It's so touching.

407
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
But.

408
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Sin is always a sin.

409
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
What's wrong with you?

411
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Just now.

412
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,420
There was a strange person.

413
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Where?

414
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
I didn't see it.

415
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
I'm sorry.

416
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,420
I'm sorry.

417
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,420
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
I didn't see it.

425
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Thank you.

426
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
It's okay.

427
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,420
Master.

428
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Do you have any drink?

429
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Take it yourself.

430
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,420
It's raining heavily.

431
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
I'll hide here.

432
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,420
Sit down.

433
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Sit down.

434
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Sit down.

435
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Sit down.

436
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,420
Sit down.

437
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,420
Sit down.

438
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
It's raining.

439
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
You can't hear me.

440
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
What do you do?

441
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,420
SID.

442
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Uncle Guo.

443
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
I want to talk to you.

444
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
About Guo Feilin's case 16 years ago.

445
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
He's been dead for 16 years.

446
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,420
I recorded the murderer.

447
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
I recorded it myself.

448
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,420
I've been looking forward to it.

449
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
What's left to talk about?

450
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,420
Uncle Guo.

451
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
I'm not here to pick you up.

452
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
We received a case.

453
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
It's also a missing girl case.

454
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,420
It's the one you just saw.

455
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
You think too much.

456
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
I didn't see it.

457
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
Uncle Guo.

458
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
There's evidence to prove that

459
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,420
it might have something to do with the case.

460
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
What?

461
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,420
She was wearing a piece of clothing when she disappeared.

462
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
There are too many missing children in this world.

463
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
What does it have to do with me?

464
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Three days after she disappeared,

465
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,420
a suspect sent a recording to her parents.

466
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
There was crying and crying.

467
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
There was also a piece of clothing.

468
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
It was like a box of bells.

469
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
Uncle Guo.

470
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,420
This is exactly the same as when Lingling was killed.

471
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Impossible.

472
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I've already killed her.

473
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,420
This girl is called Qu Tong.

474
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
She's usually very sensible.

475
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Today is the fifth day she disappeared.

476
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Uncle Guo.

477
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
The six girls in Lotus Mountain have died.

478
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,420
But this girl might still have some chance to survive.

479
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,420
I beg you to help us find her.

480
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Give Lingling

481
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,420
and the other children who couldn't even find their bodies an explanation.

482
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
I'm sorry.

484
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,420
I'm sorry.

485
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
I'm sorry.

486
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,420
I only have a few questions.

488
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,420
I'll leave after I finish asking.

489
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
I won't bother you.

490
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
Uncle Guo.

491
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
Did you mention the details of the case

492
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,420
where the bell was placed in the pencil box?

493
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
I did.

494
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Can you give me a list?

495
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,420
Lingling's class teacher

496
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,420
was a relative who worked in the telephone bureau.

497
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,420
The one who called

498
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,420
and the few people who were in the garbage station

499
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
all know everything.

500
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
It's too confusing.

501
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
There are some things

502
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,420
I repeated with many people many times.

503
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,420
I can't remember.

504
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
And the person in charge at the time,

505
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,420
his surname is Yang.

506
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
His name is Yang Zhengfeng.

507
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,420
He knows everything about the case.

508
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Go ask him.

509
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,420
He's my teacher.

510
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
He's already been promoted.

511
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Let's talk about Lv Zhixian.

512
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
When did you start investigating?

513
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,420
How did you find Wu Guangcheng?

514
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
At that time, the special investigation team

515
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,420
didn't make any progress.

516
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,420
I was anxious.

517
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
I couldn't help it.

518
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
I went to investigate it myself.

519
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
The garbage disposal station in the pencil box

520
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,420
was the only clue I knew.

521
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
I was dreaming

522
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
about the person who kidnapped my daughter

523
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
and took her away.

524
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
There's a passage from the city to Lianhua Island.

525
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,420
To avoid the mountain,

526
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
we just passed the garbage disposal station.

527
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Who are you looking for?

528
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Have you seen my daughter?

529
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Never.

530
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Go.

531
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I'm sorry.

532
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
I knew it.

533
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
The faster I find the clue,

534
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
the safer the people will be.

535
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,420
You mean the person who kidnapped Guo Feiling

536
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
took her away from Lianhua Island

537
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
for some reason.

538
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,420
He stopped the car in front of the high speed.

539
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
He took her to the garbage disposal station

540
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
and made that call.

541
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
Why did he do that?

542
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
It's unreasonable.

543
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,420
He kidnapped a teenager.

544
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
He's not a baby.

545
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
He took a child

546
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
in a car

547
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
at a high speed

548
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,420
and put her in an unfamiliar environment

549
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
to be punished.

550
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
It's too risky.

551
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Your master said so.

552
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Later, the case was said to be a cross-border case.

553
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Several cases were investigated together.

554
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
I couldn't wait.

555
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,420
I couldn't wait for a day.

556
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
I couldn't wait.

557
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,420
So I followed the clue

558
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,420
of the only outsider

559
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
and asked the hotels and hotels

560
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
near Lingling School.

561
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Finally,

562
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,420
I found Wu Guangchang.

563
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Wu Guangchang is not from Xinzhou.

564
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
But I heard

565
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,420
he was in the hospital nearby.

566
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Why do you suspect him?

567
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
The nurse saw

568
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
a girl coming to him.

569
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Do you understand?

570
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
If you have a daughter

571
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
who is so big,

572
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,420
you will be

573
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
sensitive

574
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,420
to everything.

575
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Then I followed her.

576
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
I didn't see the girl.

577
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
I saw a boy in school uniform

578
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,420
and followed her secretly.

579
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
It was said that

580
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
a girl in the class

581
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
was innocent.

582
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,420
She was the class monitor.

583
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
The class monitor asked her

584
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
to find out the situation.

585
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
The girl didn't go home.

586
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,420
She clearly saw

587
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
Wu's pick-up

588
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
after school.

589
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
But when she asked him,

590
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
he didn't admit it.

591
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
Then?

592
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
One day,

593
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
the boy called me suddenly.

594
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
I saw

595
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Wu Guangchang

596
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,420
was holding a girl.

597
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
The girl was struggling.

598
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
She was dragged away.

599
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
It was Su Lingnan.

600
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
I asked the boy

601
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
who was in the same class to leave.

602
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
I went to Wu Guangchang's house

603
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
and saw that bastard.

604
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
He dragged that girl home.

605
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,420
I...

606
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,420
Who is it?

607
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
The one who charge the electricity bill.

608
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
Come again.

609
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
What are you doing?

610
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
What are you doing?

611
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
Get out.

612
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Get out.

613
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,420
What are you doing?

614
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
The end

615
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
Uncle Guo

616
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
in your opinion,

617
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
Is Wu Guangchang

618
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
a spiritual leader?

619
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
Not really.

620
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
One last question.

621
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Do you remember

622
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
what the boy's name was?

623
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
His surname is Xu.

624
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
It seems to be

625
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Xu Dongyu.

626
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
Boss,

627
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
I forgot to bring the diet tea.

628
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Xu Dongyu's information

629
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
looks nothing special.

630
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
He's a second generation immigrant from Wu Island.

631
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
He has money at home.

632
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
He's a free photographer now.

633
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
Where's Su Lingnan?

634
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
She's not here.

635
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Not here?

636
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,420
She left the new house and went back to her hometown?

637
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
Yes.

638
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
But she didn't go back to the one on Wu Island.

639
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
She went to the one in heaven.

640
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
She's gone.

641
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
How old is she?

642
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
She's gone.

643
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
After that,

644
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
she basically died.

645
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
She didn't get a name card.

646
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
She didn't get any grades.

647
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
She was so poor

648
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,420
that she got a degree in the university.

649
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
She was young and beautiful

650
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
and she was with some rich people.

651
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
Later, she was very messy.

652
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
She got sick.

653
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,420
She passed away two months ago.

654
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
This is the last

655
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,420
end of the survivor.

656
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,420
Just a thin book.

657
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
It seems that all of this

658
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
is on Xu Dongnv.

659
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Don't worry.

660
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
It's nothing.

661
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
We just want to trouble you

662
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
to help us get back to the city.

663
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
We'll help you.

664
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
We'll help you.

665
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
We'll help you.

666
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
We'll help you.

667
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
We'll help you.

668
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
You can help us

669
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
with some things.

670
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Okay.

671
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Did you study

672
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
in the school of economics in high school?

673
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
Yes.

674
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Do you remember

675
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
a classmate called Su Lingnan?

676
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,420
Yes.

677
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
Can you tell us about her?

678
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
She

679
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
hasn't contacted me for many years.

680
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
She is

681
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
a very beautiful girl.

682
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
She likes to wear all kinds of

683
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
random dresses.

684
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
You asked me to come

685
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
for the case of the girl

686
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
in the broadcast.

687
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
I received it on the way.

688
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Then I don't know the whole thing.

689
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
About the case of

690
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Wu Guangchang kidnapping and murdering,

691
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
how much do you know?

692
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
Well,

693
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,420
not much.

694
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
Because at that time, I thought

695
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
that this kind of thing

696
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
wouldn't let a child

697
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,420
know so clearly.

698
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
But there was a victim's father

699
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,420
who said he had found you.

700
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
The reason why Su Lingnan was able to get it

701
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
was because you

702
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,420
sent a letter in time.

703
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
I don't remember.

704
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
I don't remember.

705
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
It's been more than ten years.

706
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
I really don't remember.

707
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
One of the victims

708
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
of the kidnapping and murder case

709
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
was the victim's father.

710
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
He was once in the middle school

711
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
and followed up on investigations.

712
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
He saw you secretly

713
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,420
following up on this Wu Guangchang

714
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
and started to discuss it.

715
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Do you remember?

716
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
It seems

717
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
that there is such a thing.

718
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,420
I really don't remember.

719
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,420
He answered the question

720
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,420
and was still in a daze.

721
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,420
Why is he so slow?

722
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,420
Boss, do you think he is suspicious?

723
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
Just a bunch of broken flowers.

724
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,420
It's not enough.

725
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
Pingzhao Middle School is a private school.

726
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
They usually wear uniform and strict management.

727
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,420
There are only some special students

728
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,420
who can meet the appropriate standards

729
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,420
based on the requirements in their image.

730
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
There is only one Su Lingnan in the class.

731
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
He can remember.

732
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
It's normal.

733
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
But...

734
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
But...

735
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,420
I think it's a bit strange.

736
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
The case of Wu Guangchang

737
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,420
was also a case of confusion.

738
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,420
How come you,

739
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,420
a person who participated in it,

740
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
can't remember it clearly?

741
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,420
I can't remember it clearly.

742
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,420
It's like this.

743
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,420
When I was in high school,

744
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,420
I had a serious illness

745
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
and a high fever.

746
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
I didn't recover.

747
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
I had a fever

748
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
and a little bit of a headache.

749
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
Since then,

750
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,420
I don't have good memory.

751
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,420
My reaction is also rather bad.

752
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
I'm sorry.

753
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Are you married?

754
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
Where were you on the night of the 27th?

755
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
At home.

756
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Were you alone?

757
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
Of course I was alone when I was single.

758
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
What did you do at home?

759
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
I read books.

760
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
A book about photography skills.

761
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Mr. Xu.

762
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
In order to cooperate with the investigation,

763
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
can we fish for your vehicle's record?

764
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,420
Of course we can.

765
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
My car is outside.

766
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Do you two have any questions?

767
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,420
If not,

768
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
can I leave today?

769
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
You can leave first.

770
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,420
It's like this.

771
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
I have a job tomorrow.

772
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
I might have to go back to the hospital in advance.

773
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
Brother, I've arranged it.

774
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,420
Leave here

775
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,420
and go to the hospital 24 hours later.

776
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,420
Okay.

777
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
Thank you, Brother.

778
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
Thank you.

779
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,420
Go to the hospital today.

780
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,420
The management of the school is very strict.

781
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Yes.

782
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,420
I only asked you to study more.

783
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,420
But I'm used to it.

784
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Thank you.

785
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
Is it because you don't have time to date?

786
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
If you say a word to a girl,

787
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,420
eight teachers will listen to you.

788
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
Whoever likes her, she has to endure it.

789
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,420
Yes.

790
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Did Mr. Xu have a girl he liked?

791
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
The special students of the school's school age

792
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,420
must be very eye-catching in the class.

793
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Who didn't like pretty girls when they were young?

794
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,420
Now people have left.

795
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,420
It's meaningless to talk about this.

796
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Please.

797
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,420
I'll go first.

798
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,420
You can stay here.

799
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Okay.

800
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,420
I knew this person had died

801
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
when I was planning to send a message to Suling Night.

802
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,420
I haven't told him about this until now.

803
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,420
So,

804
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,420
Xu Dongyu, who hasn't contacted him for many years,

805
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,420
is the bad guy who knew from the hot-hearted classmate

806
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,420
or...

807
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Follow him closely

808
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,420
to know the answer.

809
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,420
Yes.

810
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,420
Okay.

811
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
I just got lucky with Lu Guanghao.

812
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
I really can't talk nonsense.

813
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,420
It's serious.

814
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,420
Why didn't you get hurt?

815
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
I'm fine.

816
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
I'm fine.

817
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,420
I'm fine.

818
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
I'm fine.

819
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
I'm fine.

820
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,420
I'm fine.

821
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,420
I'm fine.

822
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
I'm fine.

823
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,420
I'm fine.

824
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,420
I'm fine.

825
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
I'm fine.

826
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm fine.

827
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm fine.

828
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Did you get hurt?

829
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,420
I'm fine.

830
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm fine.

831
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Did you get hurt?

832
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
What happened?

833
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
You know what happened?

834
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
You're done, right?

835
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
Mr. Pei,

836
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
you can't do this.

837
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,420
You're just not following the rules of life.

838
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
Young people nowadays

839
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,420
are too busy with their work and don't like to exercise.

840
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,420
They play computer games all day long.

841
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
You can't do this.

842
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
How can you be healthy?

843
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Don't think that you're young

844
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
and you're twenty or thirty years old,

845
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
but you're twenty or thirty years old.

846
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,420
You're old and you're not young.

847
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Doctor,

848
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,420
these young people don't play computer games.

849
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
They play songs every day.

850
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
Look at your face.

851
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
It's so pale.

852
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
This is a sign of decay and loss of life.

853
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
I'm a little bit.

854
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Fortunately, this time, it's just a minor problem.

855
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Let me fix it for you.

856
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
You can come and get it in a few days.

857
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,420
No,

858
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,420
but you must remember

859
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,420
to quit smoking, drinking and drinking.

860
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,420
And you must stop drinking.

861
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
Otherwise, Mr. Pei,

862
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,420
ten years later,

863
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,420
you'll become

864
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,420
a little bit more drunk.

865
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Thank you, doctor.

866
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
You're welcome.

867
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Thank you, doctor.

868
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
Gapeng Cui.

869
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
The exit ahead...

870
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
You've walked past it.

871
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Do you know how to see the island?

872
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Be polite.

873
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,420
I've missed my last appointment

874
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,420
to take care of you, the disabled person.

875
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,420
And did I say I was going to send you home?

876
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I was going to sell you out.

877
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I've been calling every home.

878
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
Let's go.

879
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,420
The buyer is waiting for the goods.

880
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I can't stop you.

881
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,420
You should take me in a little bit more carefully.

882
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,420
You go and get the buyer.

883
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm leaving.

884
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
Okay.

885
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,420
I'll go.

886
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
Bye.

887
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,420
Take care.

888
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,420
The buyer is waiting for the goods.

889
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,420
I miscalculated the right way to the right.

890
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,420
I was driving the wrong way.

891
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,420
It's an accident.

892
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,420
It's not a birthday cake.

893
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,420
Why are you hiding?

894
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,420
The cake won't bother you.

895
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
What's wrong?

896
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,420
Did I remember it wrong?

897
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Or did you say you don't have to buy anything tonight?

898
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
The doctor said

899
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,420
you should quit smoking and drinking.

900
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,420
I see you're a good driver.

901
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Don't go out tonight.

902
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,420
Just live a happy life

903
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,420
with me, an old man.

904
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,420
The destination is home.

905
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,420
Please continue to show the route in high light.

906
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,420
I'm sorry.

907
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,420
I'm sorry.

908
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,420
I'm sorry.

909
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,420
I'm sorry.

910
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,420
I'm sorry.

911
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,420
I'm sorry.

912
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,420
I'm sorry.

913
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,420
I'm sorry.

914
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,420
I'm sorry.

915
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,420
I'm sorry.

916
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,420
I'm sorry.

917
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,420
I'm sorry.

918
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,420
I'm sorry.

919
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,420
I'm sorry.

920
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,420
I'm sorry.

921
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,420
I'm sorry.

922
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,420
I'm sorry.

923
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,420
I'm sorry.

924
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,420
I'm sorry.

925
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,420
I'm sorry.

926
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,420
I'm sorry.

927
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,420
I'm sorry.

928
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,420
I'm sorry.

929
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
I'm sorry.

930
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,420
I'm sorry.

931
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
I'm sorry.

932
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,420
I'm sorry.

933
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,420
I'm sorry.

934
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,420
I'm sorry.

935
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,420
I'm sorry.

936
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,420
I'm sorry.

937
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,420
I'm sorry.

938
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,420
I'm sorry.

939
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,420
I'm sorry.

940
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,420
I'm sorry.

941
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,420
I'm sorry.

942
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,420
I'm sorry.

943
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
I'm sorry.

944
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,420
I'm sorry.

945
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,420
I'm sorry.

946
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,420
I'm sorry.

947
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
I'm sorry.

948
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,420
I'm sorry.

949
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,420
I'm sorry.

950
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,420
