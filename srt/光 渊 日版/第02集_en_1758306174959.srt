1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,360
Fuchun you know who can live in life

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You

11
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You

12
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You

13
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You

14
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You

15
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You

16
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You

17
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You

18
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You

19
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You

20
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You

21
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But that day

22
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He Zongyi asked him about a place

23
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What place?

24
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Boss, I got it

25
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That place is

26
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Chengguang Public Library

27
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You

28
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Brother Tao Ze

29
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Haven't seen you for a day

30
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The night before

31
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you in Chengguang Public Library?

32
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes

33
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What's wrong?

34
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you with someone called Zhang Donglan?

35
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes

36
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What's wrong?

37
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you sure it's a suspect?

38
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes

39
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The Chengguang Public Library you found

40
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is a private meeting place set by Zhang Donglan

41
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And on the day of the crime

42
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Zhang Donglan was in Chengguang Public Library

43
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Did you bring him back?

44
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There's no barrier in the next district, right?

45
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No

46
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This matter involved the special investigation team

47
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But now there is a reason

48
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The next district thinks it's Zhang Zuo's nephew

49
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What's the fun?

50
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So we can't bring him back

51
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But this is a long story

52
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes

53
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I might have beaten this bastard

54
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So?

55
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's wrong?

56
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've beaten many people

57
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But this has nothing to do with me

58
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You should ask Pei Su

59
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I told you

60
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was with him that day

61
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Manager Tao

62
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I tell you

63
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If it weren't for Pei Ye

64
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You guys are holding me like this

65
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm so

66
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm so

67
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Manager Tao, you're so smart

68
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Captain Luo

69
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There's a Pei who wants to talk to Manager Tao

70
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Pei?

71
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's him again

72
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please sit

73
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You really treat this as your own house?

74
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Where's Tao Ze?

75
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He's busy

76
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Manager Du

77
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Your coffee has a strange scent

78
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you need me to bring you some good coffee?

79
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll bring it to you

80
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay

81
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you

82
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm going to go to the office

83
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll be back

84
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you

85
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Thank you

86
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you

87
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The night before the third

88
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
8 to 11

89
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Where are you? Who are you with?

90
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you doing? Tell me if you want to know

91
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you have to worry about this case?

92
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You have to be polite to me

93
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because if someone doesn't ask you to come in

94
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Your interrogation won't be forced

95
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm not happy

96
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can leave anytime

97
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to make you happy

98
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay

99
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
How?

100
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going to sing a song for you

101
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Or go out and buy you a candy

102
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Sorry, Qian Yi

103
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm a little dizzy

104
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you're dumb

105
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You can't leave the world

106
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not far from world peace

107
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can't read this

108
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Have you seen this person?

109
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes

110
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Time, location

111
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The night before the third

112
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I went to the cafe

113
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I only saw one side

114
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I remember it so clearly

115
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The features on the forehead are too clear

116
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You know

117
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've been like this since I was a kid

118
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In a month, I'll be over the moon

119
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The night before the third

120
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Have you been to Chenguang Park?

121
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
8 to 11

122
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Can you testify for Zhang Donglan?

123
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Around 8.30 at night

124
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I left yesterday

125
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I didn't talk to him during these two hours

126
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Only these two hours

127
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There are three and a half hours in the middle

128
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If I say I've been with him

129
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You won't believe it

130
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That means

131
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can't testify

132
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He didn't finish the night

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't, but someone can

134
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you need

135
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Can't let everyone who accepted him that night

136
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Come in two hours

137
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Are you hinting at me?

138
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You plan to use your financial transactions

139
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
To fake a witness

140
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What?

141
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
A few models to fake a witness?

142
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A manager like Luo

143
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Will be worried

144
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That he can't find out the truth

145
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No

146
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm telling you

147
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why Zhang Donglan can't be the murderer

148
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If it's him

149
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He doesn't have to kill

150
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He can call someone

151
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
To kidnap him

152
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Anyway, the West District is

153
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A populous population from all over the island

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
People leave without notice every day

155
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And disappear without anyone noticing

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When a murderer

157
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Is killed, it's usually not clear

158
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You mean

159
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Intimacy

160
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So, manager Lu

161
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Except for the moment he was beaten

162
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is there any other sound of a shield?

163
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Are you asking me or me asking you?

164
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It sounds like nothing

165
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But I suggest you put the attention

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
On the person beside the dead

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This situation is very likely to be a familiar case

168
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The two have a deep relationship

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Are you trying to make Zhang Donglan

170
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Disregard the relationship?

171
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm just asking

172
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Occasionally, or someone you're not familiar with

173
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Losing your mind for a short time

174
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Is a murder

175
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's not a murder

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The murderer's emotions are explosive

177
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Anger rushes to the top

178
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And then it's explosive

179
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Facing a person who has been beaten

180
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And has no ability to fight back

181
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I think his head should be smashed

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Very used

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But

184
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If it's a person I've always wanted to kill

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I will choose

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Lace

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Lace

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Lace is a kind of

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A way of killing in a water-soaked and enjoyable way

190
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Sometimes it even has a little

191
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The meaning of that aspect

192
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
A person who coughs his throat

193
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you think he would sit down

194
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And taste it?

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I personally think

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This process is not very natural

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So you think

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Murder is a taste of tea

199
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's just an analogy

200
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No need to be so polite

201
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I mean

202
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The murderer can't be Zhang Donglan

203
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Even if he kills, he won't throw his body

204
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Even if he throws his body, he won't choose

205
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A person he doesn't know

206
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is a rational point of view

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
From a instinctive point of view

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Zhang Donglan's father

209
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Zhang Zhaolin

210
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He is the chairman of Hehe

211
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
His uncle is the head of your special investigation team

212
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Not to mention he has been spoiled since he was a child

213
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And he is a coward who can't stand the wall

214
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Anger is the most common

215
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Even if he kills

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
He doesn't have the courage to do it

217
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Captain Lu

219
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Can I go now?

220
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Sign

221
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Confirm

222
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Thank you for your cooperation in the investigation

223
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're welcome

224
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I am Chong Taozhe

225
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This process

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I really have to thank you

227
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Captain Lu

228
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Don't you think this matter has a bigger doubt?

229
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why does your special investigation team have to intervene in this case?

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Your case

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
From the beginning

232
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's inexplicably attracted

233
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Such a high level of attention

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And at the beginning it was said that the serial case

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
lead you to intervene

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Normally

237
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
After a brief attention

238
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
People will lose interest in him

239
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But at this time

240
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Zhang Donglan is involved

241
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If it's really him

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Then for your special investigation team

243
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That is what people say

244
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The last hope

245
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Is a huge grudge

246
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You have to be careful

248
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I think

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You have to be careful

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Is this a coincidence?

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Or

252
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Is there someone behind

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But this is also normal

254
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Just like that sentence

255
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
How to say

256
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
In Xinzhou

257
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
No heart

258
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No heart

259
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No heart

260
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No heart

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No heart

262
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No heart

263
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No heart

264
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Chengguang Public Library

265
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The surveillance photos of the stone road have been posted on your mobile phone

266
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I may be a little too much

267
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Since you have already found Chengguang Public Library

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I believe you will find this

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You are just

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
A normal warm-hearted citizen

271
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Provide a set of clues

272
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Pei Su

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's next week

274
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's been seven years

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You still can't get over it

276
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait a minute

278
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What's up

279
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Xia Xixun has arrested Miao Xiaowei

280
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
How is it

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That kid said

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He might have drunk some wine that night

284
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He was a hooligan

285
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He was impulsive

286
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He didn't remember

287
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Which social youth he was

288
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I showed him the photo

289
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He said he only had a little impression

290
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He said he never apologized to anyone

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And never gave anyone a phone

292
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I think the last sentence is true

293
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He still doesn't think he's wrong

294
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Maybe there is a chance

295
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe

296
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Zhang Donglan is not on the scene

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Did you find someone to investigate

298
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
By the way

299
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Did Pei Su come just now

300
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He left early

301
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I told you that this little bastard is getting more and more

302
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I told you before, don't get used to it

303
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Look at him now

304
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Pei Su just said

305
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That night, Zhang Donglan, except for being with him

306
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He was having an affair with a girl

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He should have never left Chengguang Public Library

308
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If Zhang Donglan didn't have time to do the case

309
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
At least he can clear the special investigation team

310
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It doesn't matter if it's clear now

311
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What

312
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What

313
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Xiao Hanyang called in a hurry

314
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Said Cui Hongliang had caught Miao Xiaowei

315
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And he admitted that he had a major suspicion

316
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What? What is the evidence that he admitted

317
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's He Zongyi's phone

318
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Xiao Wu and the others found that phone

319
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The thief who stole the phone confessed

320
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He admitted that Miao Xiaowei was the one who sold the phone

321
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then the next day, the police also checked Miao Xiaowei and the deceased's fingerprints on the phone

322
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Just one phone, the evidence is not complete

323
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This can only show that Miao Xiaowei stole He Zongyi's phone

324
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Not enough to prove that he killed someone

325
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And the statement

326
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The police brought him back to interrogate him

327
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Asked him where the phone came from

328
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He was late for a while, said he heard the quarrel and picked it up at the crime scene

329
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What's the difference with suicide

330
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes

331
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I haven't seen such a honest murderer in many years

332
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And more

333
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
They are still on Miao Xiaowei's arm

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Found the needle and needle

335
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's the West Lake again

336
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you think a lot of things

337
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I dare to grab

338
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Unprecedented

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This was originally a gunshot case

340
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But now it involves Zhao Nan Group

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And it involves Xidu

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
correct

343
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We interrogate Zhang Donglan

344
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What did Zhang Zu say

345
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Hiding from the world

346
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Du Zu

347
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
How did this thing

348
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Shock you

349
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You brought Zhang Donglan

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Can i not come

351
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm doing this for Zhang Zu

352
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I killed Zhang Donglan

353
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Others can't catch the evidence of the team

354
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You kid

355
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm afraid someone will use this relationship to make an article

356
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I can't see your mind

357
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This case involves Zhang Zu

358
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The surveillance agency is very important

359
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Zhang is trying to avoid suspicion

360
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Now I will temporarily

361
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Take this job

362
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So serious

363
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You come to me

364
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Boss, the phone records of the joint

365
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And the surveillance of Chengguang Public Hall

366
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The phone is mine, the surveillance is yours

367
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
No bonus

368
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Work overtime

369
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You mean

370
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This Posh has a special type

371
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes

372
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We checked the victim's shoes

373
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In the crime scene, it was full of mud and garbage

374
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Very clean

375
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And Miao Xiaowei also confirmed

376
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
When He Zongyi went out

377
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So basically excluded the possibility of the murderer changing

378
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If the murderer wants to transfer the crime scene

379
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Why did he choose

380
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
A place with a large number of

381
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Where people bump into

382
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Unless this place

383
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Say it

384
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Unless this place

385
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Even if someone sees something

386
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I dare not say

387
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Miao Xiaowei when he was being interrogated

388
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He clearly explained that he heard someone arguing near the crime scene

389
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But the one who asked what he saw downstairs

390
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Just know nothing

391
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This shows that in this place

392
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Things often happen that these people dare not say

393
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Luo Weizhao

394
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What are you hinting at

395
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Du Zuo

396
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
At first I was just suspecting

397
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
When Zhang Zuo told me

398
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I knew Liu Cunfan was just an excuse

399
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm afraid it's a few months ago

400
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Xia Xiqun has been continuously

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Poisoning and murdering

402
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
That's what we need to pay attention to

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Just now Xiaoqiao told me

404
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Found an injection needle hole on Miao Xiaowei's arm

405
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm basically sure

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This is an anonymous report

407
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Inside are the three cases you mentioned

408
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The three cases

409
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Cui Hongliang, the chief of Xia Xiqun

410
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Is the protector of the drug group

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What do you think?

412
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
As you can see, the three cases are all in the same area

413
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The same as He Songyi's throwing place

414
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But these are just speculations

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And lack of solid evidence

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So this is why Zhang Zuo asked us to enter

417
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There are many clues in here

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Many things

419
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Very ambiguous

420
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I didn't get it this morning

421
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If this material is true

422
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Then there is a reason for throwing away the body

423
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
There is also a reason for everyone to be in a coma

424
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
As for He Songyi

425
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Either he has a connection with the drug addict

426
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Or the murderer knows the inside

427
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He deliberately moved the body

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let these drug dealers place a life-saving bullet

429
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
These suspicions are not enough

430
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And lack of solid evidence

431
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Otherwise the special investigation team

432
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Still has no right to intervene in the investigation

433
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Don't let Tao Zi and the others

434
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Follow Zhang Donglan's line

435
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Because it involves the Zhang team

436
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's already a matter of the special investigation team

437
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Another line, you go and check alone

438
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Don't go to Xia Xiqun

439
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
If you have any news, report it to me directly

440
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes, we will check it separately

441
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I have evidence, I will apply for official intervention

442
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Okay, go ahead

443
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Go back and look

444
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Xia Xiqun is full of fish

445
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Many drug dealers are life-saving

446
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Don't forget what your master told you

447
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Don't be reckless

448
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Don't worry, Lao Du

449
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Tao Fu, I finished

450
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Tao Fu, I finished

451
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
My eyes are blind

452
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
How is it

453
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You look like you have the wrong blood

454
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What's wrong

455
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Did you see the doctor

456
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I didn't see the doctor

457
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I can't see

458
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I can't see

459
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So I can't see

460
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I see

461
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You can't see

462
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I can't see

463
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I can't see

464
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,120
My eyes are about to go blind.

465
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,720
How is it?

466
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Zhang Donglan went out four times in total.

467
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,320
The total time is 40 minutes.

468
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
But each time is shorter.

469
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,880
Around nine o'clock,

470
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,920
the dinner in Chengguang Palace was about to end.

471
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,480
Zhang Donglan came out of the room.

472
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,280
The first time he was photographed by the surveillance cameras in the yard.

473
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,920
He stayed in the yard for a while.

474
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,840
Then he went back to the room.

475
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,120
At nine forty-five,

476
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,800
the surveillance cameras in the yard photographed him again.

477
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,960
He talked to a girl for a while.

478
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,960
Then they went to the woods together.

479
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,880
That's right.

480
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,240
The surveillance cameras in the yard photographed Zhang Donglan and a girl.

481
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,760
They came out of the woods together.

482
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,840
It's so slow.

483
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,720
It seems that Zhang Donglan has no time to do anything.

484
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
Did you take a photo of the clothes?

485
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,360
There are too many cameras in the yard.

486
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,240
I'm still checking.

487
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,320
Captain Luo said that in the surveillance cameras in the yard,

488
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,120
we can find the surveillance cameras of the stone road.

489
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,280
Stone road?

490
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,240
Why?

491
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,520
I don't know.

492
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,560
But...

493
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,880
It seems that Pei Su said it.

494
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
Pei Su?

495
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Tao Fu.

496
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,840
Actually, I've been wanting to ask you a question for a long time.

497
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,560
Can I ask you?

498
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,640
You want to ask Pei Su?

499
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,120
Who is Pei Su?

500
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,160
Why is Boss so against him?

501
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,960
But it seems that he still values his opinion.

502
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,720
And seven years ago...

503
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,240
What happened seven years ago?

504
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,120
Seven years ago?

505
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,440
Who told you that?

506
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,640
I heard Boss said it himself at the door.

507
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,600
But I didn't eavesdrop on them.

508
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,080
So...

509
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
What happened?

510
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,320
Pei Su is the person who handled the case with me and Wei Zhao.

511
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,560
It was seven years ago.

512
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,760
Wei Zhao and I just graduated from school.

513
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,840
You know that.

514
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,080
His family has been in Xinzhou.

515
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,040
He has good grades.

516
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,200
He rarely competes with him in terms of ability.

517
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
So when we started to do social surveys,

518
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,360
Wei Zhao wanted to save the Galaxy every day.

519
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,720
He could turn a social conflict into a battle.

520
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,040
But what good cases could he encounter in social surveys?

521
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
The only case we encountered was also the first case.

522
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,000
It was Pei Su.

523
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Mom!

524
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
What's wrong?

525
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
What's wrong?

526
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
What's wrong?

527
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
What's wrong?

528
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
What's wrong?

529
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
What's wrong?

530
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
What's wrong?

531
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
What's wrong?

532
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
What's wrong?

533
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
What's wrong?

534
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
What's wrong?

535
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
What's wrong?

536
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
What's wrong?

537
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
What's wrong?

538
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
What's wrong?

539
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
What's wrong?

540
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
What's wrong?

541
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
What's wrong?

542
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
What's wrong?

543
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
What's wrong?

544
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
What's wrong?

545
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
What's wrong?

546
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
What's wrong?

547
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
What's wrong?

548
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
What's wrong?

549
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
What's wrong?

550
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
What's wrong?

551
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
What's wrong?

552
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
What's wrong?

553
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
What's wrong?

554
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
What's wrong?

555
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
What's wrong?

556
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
What's wrong?

557
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
What's wrong?

558
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
What's wrong?

559
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
What's wrong?

560
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
What's wrong?

561
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
What's wrong?

562
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
What's wrong?

563
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
What's wrong?

564
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
What's wrong?

565
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
What's wrong?

566
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
What's wrong?

567
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
What's wrong?

568
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
What's wrong?

569
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
What's wrong?

570
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
What's wrong?

571
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
What's wrong?

572
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
What's wrong?

573
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
What's wrong?

574
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
What's wrong?

575
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
What's wrong?

576
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
What's wrong?

577
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
What's wrong?

578
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
What's wrong?

579
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
What's wrong?

580
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
What's wrong?

581
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,600
What's wrong?

582
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
What's wrong?

583
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
What's wrong?

584
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
What's wrong?

585
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
What's wrong?

586
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
What's wrong?

587
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
What's wrong?

588
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
What's wrong?

589
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
What's wrong?

590
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
What's wrong?

591
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
What's wrong?

592
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
What's wrong?

593
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
What's wrong?

594
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
What's wrong?

595
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
What's wrong?

596
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
What's wrong?

597
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
What's wrong?

598
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
What's wrong?

599
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
What's wrong?

600
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,360
What's M TM Se bookstore?

601
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,600
What's wrong?

602
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
What's wrong?

603
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
What's wrong?

604
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
What's wrong?

605
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
What's wrong?

606
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
What's wrong?

607
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
What's wrong?

608
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
All the evidence points to suicide.

609
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,280
But the

610
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,320
police didn't believe it.

611
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,880
No.

612
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,600
It's very emotional.

613
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,880
My dad is a spiritual listener.

614
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,680
He must have killed us.

615
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,480
My mom couldn't have killed herself.

616
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,600
It's my dad.

617
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,160
She insists that her mom's death

618
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,680
is related to her father.

619
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,840
My mom couldn't have killed herself.

620
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,240
My mom couldn't have killed herself.

621
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,320
Impossible!

622
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,520
Mr. Lin.

623
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,360
Although the case has been dismissed,

624
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
there will be some procedures

625
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,760
to be followed.

626
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,000
Please cooperate.

627
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,800
Okay.

628
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Sorry to trouble you.

629
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,080
Wait.

630
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,400
Mr. Su.

631
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,040
Do you have anything else?

632
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,040
There are some doubts about this case.

633
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:33,320
...

634
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,480
Boss,

635
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,100
did you just

636
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,780
investigate the case without considering the rules?

637
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Impossible. This is not his style.

638
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,780
It's not a case of investigation.

639
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,380
The evidence for this case is incriminating.

640
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,220
His father, Pei Cheng Yu,

641
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,660
was not very concerned about his family.

642
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,340
But he didn't kill his mother.

643
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,140
Then, Pei Su is...

644
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,620
This matter

645
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,340
was finally told to him by Zhao.

646
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,780
I don't know what Zhao said to him.

647
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,540
But since then,

648
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,020
they have been a little different.

649
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,580
We all think that Pei Su's death

650
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,180
to his mother is never to be forgotten.

651
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,380
It's because in the subconscious,

652
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,980
he may have abandoned his mother in the hospital.

653
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
But these words

654
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
are not enough to prove his innocence.

655
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
I don't know what Zhao said to him.

656
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,980
But since then,

657
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,580
they have been a little different.

658
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,580
He never listened.

659
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,380
Although we have been together for seven years,

660
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,580
they are...

661
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,780
One is crazy and free.

662
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,980
The other is meticulous and patient.

663
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,580
As long as they are together,

664
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,580
they are always in conflict.

665
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,380
They are always in conflict.

666
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,580
I can't blame him anymore for this.

667
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,780
Not everyone has a metallic heart.

668
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,620
He was also very obedient.

669
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,120
His parents and his mother

670
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
are similar.

671
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
Even as別長得 Concealfening

672
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,980
He is not very literate.

673
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,380
If the impression is not big enough,

674
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,780
then he could be כ Wakashio.

675
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
Let me see.

676
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,180
Why did he say his father did it?

677
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,620
His father, Pei Cheng Yu,

678
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,260
is the chairman of Pei Group.

679
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
He's a talent.

680
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,540
He doesn't care much about his family.

681
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,420
I guess he thinks

682
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,860
his father's absence

683
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,700
is responsible for his mother's suicide.

684
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,780
It's cruel for a child.

685
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,780
How's his relationship with his father?

686
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
His father had an accident three years ago.

687
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
He's been abandoned.

688
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
Are their father and son

689
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,780
really the same-sex lovers?

690
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
We can't find anything,

691
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,780
but Wei Zhao has been keeping an eye on him.

692
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
He said he found that

693
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
he has a special talent.

694
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
What talent?

695
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
Crime.

696
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,780
His memory is cruel.

697
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,780
He starts to recreate the night

698
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,780
when he was in the hospital.

699
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,780
He starts to think that

700
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,780
no matter

701
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
what happens in the future,

702
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,780
he'll look for it.

703
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
President Pei, what's up?

704
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
I'm sorry.

705
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,780
There's an update.

706
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,780
What's this time?

707
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
Yulian.

708
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,780
The Last of Us

709
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
So you are...

710
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
T.

711
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Pin the girl. Pin the girl. Pin the girl.

712
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Yeah.

713
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Jin Sanjiao Kong Di.

714
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Hello, Taozi.

715
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
Yes?

716
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
A cowhide?

717
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,780
That's right.

718
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
I got a call and left at 9.30.

719
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,780
9.30?

720
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,780
This is Kong Hao's phone number too?

721
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,780
Yeah. Who else?

722
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
No one.

723
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
Did you find where he went?

724
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Yes.

725
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,780
When he left, he didn't go to Chengguang Public Library.

726
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,780
He went to another direction.

727
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
There was a bus station.

728
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,780
Lan Qiao and I found He Zongyi on the street surveillance.

729
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,780
He got on a 34-way train.

730
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,780
He left at 10 o'clock and left at Wenchang Road Station.

731
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,780
So, Liao Xiaowei's statement is incorrect.

732
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,780
He Zongyi can't be in the next station at this time.

733
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Yes.

734
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
Good.

735
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Organize everyone.

736
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,780
Turn over Wenchang Road tomorrow.

737
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Yes.

738
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,780
I said, Pei Suo, why are you here again?

739
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,780
You came to give us warmth again?

740
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Okay, don't worry.

741
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
I'll notify you later.

742
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Let them issue you a WIP fine.

743
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,780
Do you want to eat the fine if you come here with your friend's sister?

744
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
No.

745
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,780
You're too ungrateful to ordinary citizens.

746
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Zhang Ying?

747
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Tell me frankly, do you know this person?

748
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Can you be polite to the girl?

749
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,780
It's okay, don't be afraid.

750
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Miss Zhang, this is the reception room.

751
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
Not a interrogation room.

752
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Your brother is a major suspect now.

753
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
This is a life sentence.

754
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Every word of yours is important.

755
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Do you understand?

756
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,780
It's okay, just tell the truth.

757
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
If you have the same opinion as me,

758
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,780
I think your brother has no connection with this matter.

759
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
What's the matter?

760
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,780
I've seen this person.

761
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,780
I was an intern at Jingbang.

762
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,780
I was so sleepy that day that I wanted to buy a cup of coffee.

763
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,780
I don't know why someone kept following me.

764
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
I can't remember what they were saying.

765
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Do you know a person named Feng Nian?

766
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Or Feng Nian Guo?

767
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Feng?

768
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Guo or Guo?

769
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
I don't know.

770
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
It sounds like these two.

771
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
He doesn't sound like a Xingzhou person.

772
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
He has a accent.

773
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
I don't know what he said.

774
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,780
I don't know if it's a name or a name.

775
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,780
I was so scared that I wanted to avoid him.

776
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
When did this happen?

777
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
It's been a while.

778
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
And then?

779
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Did that person get back at you?

780
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,780
No, he just hid.

781
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,780
I saw that he was quite young.

782
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,780
So I thought I misunderstood him.

783
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
I quickly pulled my brother and let him stop.

784
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
Who else was there?

785
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,780
My boyfriend.

786
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
My brother was drunk that day.

787
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
So my boyfriend drove the car.

788
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,780
They came together.

789
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,780
Why do all good girls have boyfriends?

790
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
Who is it?

791
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Why are you talking so fast?

792
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,780
It's Zhou Hongchuan from Rongshun.

793
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,780
We met at Chengguang Public Administration.

794
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,780
The law firm used by Pei's.

795
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Captain Luo has a lot of information.

796
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
And then?

797
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,780
Have you seen He Zongyi?

798
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,780
Captain Luo.

799
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,780
My brother really can't kill people.

800
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,780
He Zongyi's roommate said that

801
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,780
He Zongyi took a new phone.

802
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,780
He said that after the conflict,

803
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
the other party paid him.

804
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Do you know about this?

805
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
I don't know.

806
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,780
My brother didn't mention it to me.

807
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
I think it's not possible.

808
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
My brother really did it for me.

809
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,780
He did it.

810
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,780
There is no more relationship between us and this person.

811
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,780
My brother won't kill people because of this.

812
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,780
He won't kill people.

813
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,780
Captain Luo, please believe me.

814
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,780
Okay, don't worry.

815
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,780
Since your brother can't kill people,

816
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
he won't do anything to me.

817
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
Zhang.

818
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
Yes.

819
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Sorry, we have a flow.

820
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Please compare with my colleague.

821
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,780
It's okay.

822
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
Go ahead, don't be afraid.

823
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,780
I'll wait for you here.

824
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,780
Goodbye, Captain Luo.

825
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Where is Tao Ze?

826
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,780
Thanks to a hot-hearted citizen,

827
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
he gave us more clues.

828
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,780
He is running around the streets of the city.

829
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,780
I haven't found it yet.

830
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,780
Yes.

831
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,780
Are you too concerned about this case?

832
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,780
I remember someone once told me

833
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,780
that the market is not good.

834
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,780
Everything that happens in the world will leave a mark.

835
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,780
And these marks

836
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,780
are the only evidence that proves that I am a judge.

837
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,780
It's very important.

838
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,780
Where is Huizhang?

839
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,780
Everything that happens in the world will leave a mark.

840
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,780
And these marks

841
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,780
are the only evidence that proves that I am a judge.

842
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,780
The doors and windows are locked.

843
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,780
All rooms have no traces of intrusion.

844
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,780
The most advanced security system

845
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,780
has not been touched.

846
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,780
We have changed our clothes,

847
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,780
even put on music.

848
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,780
There is a sense of ritual.

849
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,780
The blood on the table next to it

850
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,780
is the blood of the victims.

851
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,780
The blood on the table next to it

852
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,780
is the blood of the victims.

853
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,780
The blood on the table next to it

854
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,780
is the blood of the victims.

855
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
The blood on the table next to it

856
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,780
is the blood of the victims.

857
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
The person who wrote this letter

858
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,780
has a clear sense of ritual.

859
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,780
The victim is an adult.

860
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,780
There is no sign of any person's unconsciousness.

861
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,780
There is no resistance wound on the body.

862
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,780
This is all the evidence we found at the time.

863
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
You are a security guard.

864
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,780
You came to the scene earlier than we did.

865
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,780
Unless you told me

866
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,780
what evidence you had hidden.

867
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Otherwise, this is a suicide without a doubt.

868
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,780
I told you at the time

869
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,780
that everything that happens in this world

870
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,780
will leave a trace.

871
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,780
As long as it is real,

872
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,780
you might have a sense of sense.

873
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,780
You might be able to

874
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,780
dig into someone's heart.

875
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,780
But we can't be conscious of it.

876
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,780
Okay.

877
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,780
Let's talk about the inside.

878
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,780
I don't know if you've heard

879
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,780
of a theory abroad.

880
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,780
If a person wants to commit suicide,

881
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,780
he might suddenly confess to his family

882
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,780
in a certain way.

883
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,780
Confess to his family?

884
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,780
You heard his confession at the time.

885
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,780
The night is young.

886
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,780
The night is young.

887
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,780
A person dies for seven years.

888
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,780
The concept is set.

889
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,780
The relevant evidence is already in the eye.

890
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,780
A living person can think of only emotional memories.

891
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,780
But if you only think of it,

892
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,780
it's meaningless.

893
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,780
I don't accept your theory.

894
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,780
I'm the chief.

895
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,780
I'm the chief.

896
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,780
I'm the chief.

897
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,780
I'm the chief.

898
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,780
I'm the chief.

899
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,780
I'm the chief.

900
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
I'm the chief.

901
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,780
I'm the chief.

902
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,780
I'm the chief.

903
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,780
I'm the chief.

904
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,780
I'm the chief.

905
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,780
I'm the chief.

906
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,780
I'm the chief.

907
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,780
I'm the chief.

908
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,780
I'm the chief.

909
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,780
I'm the chief.

910
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,780
I'm the chief.

911
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,780
I'm the chief.

912
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,780
I'm the chief.

913
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,780
I'm the chief.

914
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,780
I'm the chief.

915
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,780
I'm the chief.

916
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,780
I'm the chief.

917
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,780
I'm the chief.

918
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,780
I'm the chief.

919
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
I'm the chief.

920
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,780
I'm the chief.

921
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,780
I'm the chief.

922
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,780
I'm the chief.

923
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,780
I'm the chief.

924
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,780
I'm the chief.

925
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,780
I'm the chief.

926
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,780
I'm the chief.

927
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
I'm the chief.

928
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
I'm the chief.

929
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,780
I'm the chief.

930
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,780
I'm the chief.

931
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,780
I'm the chief.

932
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,780
I'm the chief.

933
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,780
I'm the chief.

934
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,780
I'm the chief.

935
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,780
I'm the chief.

936
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,780
I'm the chief.

937
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,780
I'm the chief.

938
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,780
I'm the chief.

939
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,780
I'm the chief.

940
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,780
I'm the chief.

941
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,780
I'm the chief.

942
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,780
I'm the chief.

943
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,780
I'm the chief.

944
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,780
I'm the chief.

945
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,780
I'm the chief.

946
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,780
I'm the chief.

947
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,780
I'm the chief.
