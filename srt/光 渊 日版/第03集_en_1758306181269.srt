1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
baby

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Come to me.

3
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Can you feel the pain?

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
The

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,160
That's right!

6
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll be right there.

7
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've prepared

8
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
your favorite style.

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We'll have a drink later.

10
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

11
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's have a drink.

12
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Pei Su!

13
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Pei Su, you're going to kill me?

14
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Pei Su,

15
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm different from the others.

16
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Pei Su, save me!

17
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Pei Su,

18
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
are you going to kill a pet?

19
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Pei Su!

20
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Pei Su,

21
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
are you going to kill a pet?

22
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Pei Su,

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
are you going to kill a pet?

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Pei Su,

25
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
are you going to kill a pet?

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Pei Su,

27
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
are you going to kill a pet?

28
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Pei Su,

29
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
are you going to kill a pet?

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Pei Su,

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
are you going to kill a pet?

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Pei Su,

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
are you going to kill a pet?

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Pei Su,

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
are you going to kill a pet?

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Pei Su,

37
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
are you going to kill a pet?

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pei Su,

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
are you going to kill a pet?

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Pei Su,

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
are you going to kill a pet?

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Pei Su,

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
are you going to kill a pet?

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Pei Su,

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
are you going to kill a pet?

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Pei Su,

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
are you going to kill a pet?

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Pei Su,

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
are you going to kill a pet?

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Pei Su,

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
are you going to kill a pet?

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Pei Su,

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
are you going to kill a pet?

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Pei Su,

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
are you going to kill a pet?

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Pei Su,

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
are you going to kill a pet?

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Pei Su,

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
are you going to kill a pet?

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Pei Su,

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
are you going to kill a pet?

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Pei Su,

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
are you going to kill a pet?

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Pei Su,

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
are you going to kill a pet?

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Pei Su,

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
are you going to kill a pet?

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Pei Su,

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
are you going to kill a pet?

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Pei Su,

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
are you going to kill a pet?

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Pei Su,

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
are you going to kill a pet?

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Pei Su,

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
are you going to kill a pet?

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Pei Su,

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
are you going to kill a pet?

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Pei Su,

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
are you going to

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
kill a pet?

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Pei Su,

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
are you going to kill a pet?

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Pei Su,

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
are you going to kill a pet?

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Pei Su,

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
are you going to kill a pet?

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Pei Su,

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
are you going to its snake-eatame stand?

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Pei Su,

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
are you going to its snake-eaten stand?

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Are you still trying to hypnotize yourself?

92
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,760
Very little.

93
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,400
Is it because

94
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,000
you have found

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
the memory of that period?

96
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
Actually, I don't understand

97
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,000
what's the meaning

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
of you coming to me

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,480
every once in a while

100
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
in the past year.

101
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,880
After all, from this scale,

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
you are even healthier than ordinary people.

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,800
So,

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
you should be very careful.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
From you point of view,

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I've gotten a lot from it.

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
I have never felt that

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
I've never seen

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,080
this thing you've hidden all this one year,

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,440
yet you've never experienced

111
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,680
a progress in it.

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Even until now,

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to study psychology.

114
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,420
You're doing this to study yourself?

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is this the reason why you asked me about...

116
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
...the people who share the same spiritual sense?

117
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,920
It's time.

118
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

119
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,000
It's time.

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Thank you, Ms. Bai.

121
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
I should go.

122
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Pei Su.

123
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,780
I've always thought that the friend you mentioned...

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
...would be the miracle of your memory.

125
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Maybe.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I don't need anyone else anymore.

127
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,200
Why?

128
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Because I've found...

129
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,400
...a way to solve the problem.

130
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm sorry. Dr. Wang isn't here.

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
I can help you make an appointment at 3 p.m.

132
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
Okay, bye.

133
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Mr. Pei, you're here to see your father again?

134
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
Yes.

135
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Please come in. I've made an appointment for you.

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
The doctor is already inside.

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Thank you.

138
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Thank you.

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,060
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,980
I think this flower suits you well.

146
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
Thank you.

147
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
The flower that Mr. Xiang gave me.

148
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Mr. Pei.

149
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
It's been a long time. I thought you'd come here...

150
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
...after your birthday.

151
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
I just had time to come and see you.

152
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
How are you?

153
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
I'm doing well.

154
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,060
But it's been three years.

155
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,180
I don't think I can wake up.

156
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I see.

157
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Thank you for your concern.

158
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
I'll get back to work. Call me if you need me.

159
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Look at them.

160
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
They care about you.

161
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
You're asleep.

162
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
You're even more awake.

163
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Do you remember FM 88.6?

164
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,140
I remember it.

165
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I remember it.

166
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I remember it.

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
I remember it.

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
FM 88.6?

169
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,060
It's renamed as Qiming Music.

170
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
You invested in it.

171
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I found an interesting ID on this app.

172
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
It's called...

173
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
...the Green Green Girl.

174
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
I find it interesting...

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
...because...

176
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
...they read a famous book...

177
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
...every so often.

178
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,840
What do you think...

179
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
...they're trying to do this time?

180
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I'm not sure.

181
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,220
I'm not sure.

182
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm not sure.

183
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm not sure.

184
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I'm not sure.

185
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm not sure.

186
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm not sure.

187
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
I'm not sure.

188
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm not sure.

189
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm not sure.

190
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm not sure.

191
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
I'm not sure.

192
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm not sure.

193
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
I'm just trying to scare you.

194
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
A person like you...

195
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
...shouldn't be afraid.

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I'll answer him later.

197
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,020
cars

198
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,620
I'll send you the news today.

199
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,740
Okay, Mr. Tao.

200
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,260
Hello, how is it?

201
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,300
Hello, Mr. Lu.

202
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,820
The clue is broken.

203
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,380
I just brought everyone back.

204
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,020
I'm going to do the victim analysis again.

205
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,180
What about you? Are you still outside?

206
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,140
Maybe you can find a way

207
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,180
to get to Zhang Donglan.

208
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,020
Zhang Donglan?

209
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,260
Isn't his suspect

210
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,820
basically cleared?

211
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,780
His sister came here.

212
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,940
She mentioned a mysterious person named Feng.

213
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,900
If He Zongyi didn't recognize the wrong person,

214
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,180
he should have had a relationship with Zhang Ying.

215
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
You mean the person

216
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,300
He Zongyi is going to meet at Chenguang Public Hall

217
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,460
is likely to be Zhang Donglan?

218
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,940
So you're going to interrogate Zhang Donglan again

219
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,780
and let him list

220
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,980
everyone who was at Chenguang Public Hall that night.

221
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,500
Yes.

222
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,380
But it's time to release him.

223
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,780
If you think he's suspicious,

224
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,940
should we be stopped

225
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,380
and extend the time a little bit?

226
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,220
No need.

227
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,940
Let him go.

228
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,500
But in this case,

229
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,380
we have no reason

230
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,740
to interfere with He Zongyi's case.

231
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,540
Listen to me.

232
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,060
Release him.

233
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,620
Mr. Chen.

234
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,380
This is a case

235
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,980
that the special investigation team is investigating.

236
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,940
We can only reveal

237
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,140
some details after the investigation is over.

238
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,820
So we have to keep it a secret.

239
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,940
What are you talking about?

240
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,780
I don't understand.

241
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,340
Chen Zhen.

242
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,940
I don't care

243
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,060
if you're going to ask for punishment

244
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,580
for pretending to park the car.

245
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,140
What did you say just now?

246
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,700
Didn't you send the anonymous letter?

247
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,820
I...

248
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,740
There are three cases in the anonymous letter.

249
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,940
The victim of the first case, Chen Yuan,

250
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
is your sister.

251
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,940
They were not sent in Junior Sergey's quarters.

252
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,620
Your sister Chen Yuan

253
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,500
was Eunuch Bai Bo

254
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,180
after being connived for a salt output.

255
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,060
Stepá辦法會被頒獎

256
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,540
that's impossible.

257
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,860
Do you think of power

258
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,180
I have an umbrella behind me

259
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,340
But I have seen all the materials you submitted

260
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,340
There is no evidence

261
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,700
Four people a month

262
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,420
Can't you still count the evidence?

263
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,660
Just because there is no evidence

264
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,340
Just clean up the case

265
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,300
Should my sister be framed to death?

266
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,060
Of course there is evidence to the case

267
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,540
Anyway, I must raise the importance of the whole of Xinzhou

268
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,620
Better check it out than you

269
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,420
Yes, sir

270
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,540
You are so sure

271
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,980
Why don't you just call our SID?

272
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,220
Ask for your sister's case

273
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,300
Have to use the way of anonymity

274
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,820
Go around such a big circle

275
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,500
What's your point?

276
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,820
Chen Zhen

277
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,380
Who knows if there is any problem in your SID?

278
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,260
Last hope

279
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,100
Last hope

280
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,900
The SID is like this

281
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,540
What proof do you use?

282
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,660
You are the last hope of Xinzhou

283
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,060
Zhenzhen

284
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,460
If our SID is the same as the SID

285
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,180
And we can confirm their conclusion

286
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,940
We can let you go to the SID

287
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,460
with full confidence

288
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,700
But not like this

289
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,220
In this place

290
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,740
Talk to you secretly

291
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,340
Zhenzhen

292
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,580
Whether you believe the SID or not

293
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,300
If you still want to find out the truth about your sister

294
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,180
The SID is your only hope now

295
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,220
I will go to the SID with you

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,660
I will go to the SID with you

297
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,020
I will go to the SID with you

298
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,300
I will go to the SID with you

299
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
I will go to the SID with you

300
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,780
I will go to the SID with you

301
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,140
I will go to the SID with you

302
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,500
I will go to the SID with you

303
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,780
I will go to the SID with you

304
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,980
I will go to the SID with you

305
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,180
I will go to the SID with you

306
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,460
I will go to the SID with you

307
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,660
I will go to the SID with you

308
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,860
I will go to the SID with you

309
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,140
I will go to the SID with you

310
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,500
I will go to the SID with you

311
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,620
I will go to the SID with you

312
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,900
I will go to the SID with you

313
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,260
I will go to the SID with you

314
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,540
I will go to the SID with you

315
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,300
This is my sister's relic

316
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,100
I only kept this

317
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,460
She didn't tell me anything

318
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,060
During that time

319
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,340
She couldn't sleep at all

320
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,900
It seems like she is afraid of something every day

321
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,060
She couldn't sleep at all

322
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,780
She couldn't sleep at all

323
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,460
It seems like she is afraid of something every day

324
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,260
I asked her

325
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,140
She told me to mind my own business

326
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,780
During that time

327
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,620
She seemed to call someone else

328
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,140
Who?

329
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,420
Have you heard of the Golden Triangle?

330
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,180
If I knew

331
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,860
I wouldn't ask you

332
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Not wherever the Golden Triangle is

333
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,100
Don't marry Er comunicari

334
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,420
Just have a speech

335
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,340
Opening it

336
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,260
problem

337
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,380
Shit

338
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,060
No

339
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,060
There are more

340
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,380
There are more

341
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,140
Up there is my phone

342
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,380
Finally, I should say it to you

343
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,880
Yes.

344
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,280
I don't want to be seen.

345
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,680
Ni Mu Group.

346
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,680
Hello.

347
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,180
Please help me look up another guy.

348
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,180
His name is Cui Yin.

349
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,060
Tao Fu.

350
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,660
Look at the list he listed for me.

351
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,860
I guess all the rich second generation in Xinzhou

352
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
are listed on it.

353
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,420
Then we'll have to see

354
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,500
who is suitable for the character of the narcissistic personality.

355
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
Call everyone here.

356
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Ask them one by one.

357
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,180
What about Zhang Dong Lan?

358
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,500
The time limit is about to come.

359
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,580
What else can he do?

360
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,780
There's not enough evidence.

361
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,180
According to the rules, we can only let him go.

362
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Just let him go?

363
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Yes.

364
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,740
Why is he still standing there? Go.

365
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,340
It's been a long time.

366
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
What else can he do?

367
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
He's still standing there.

368
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,860
He's still standing there.

369
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
He just left.

370
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
He's still standing there.

371
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
He's still standing there.

372
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
I'm worried about him.

373
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Captain Luo.

374
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,660
I've been thinking about it.

375
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,220
Why are you

376
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,620
with Zhang Dong Lan?

377
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Because I think he's living a very philosophical life.

378
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,860
I'm back.

379
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
You've suffered a lot.

380
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Zhang Dong Lan.

381
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I, Zhang Dong Lan,

382
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
am back.

383
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
You've suffered a lot.

384
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I'm back.

385
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm back.

386
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
I'm back.

387
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm back.

388
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
I'm back.

389
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm back.

390
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,460
All right.

391
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Today, all of you are Dong Lan's relatives.

392
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
If you need anything in the future, just say it.

393
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
Dong Lan will cut your eyes out.

394
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,460
Cut it out.

395
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Cut it out into a knife.

396
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
Come.

397
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Come.

398
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Come.

399
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Lord Pei.

400
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I missed you so much.

401
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Why did you come to save me?

402
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
I can't do it anymore.

403
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Who...

404
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
Who hurt my son?

405
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Auntie.

406
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Who...

407
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Who hurt my son?

408
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Who hurt my son?

409
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
What's going on?

410
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Let me go.

411
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
Auntie, let go of me.

412
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
What are you doing?

413
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Auntie.

414
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Let go of me.

415
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Let go.

416
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
All right.

417
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
I can't go.

418
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
I can't go.

419
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
You're not me.

420
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,460
Auntie.

421
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,460
You're not me.

422
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460
Let go of me.

423
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Auntie.

424
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Be gentle.

425
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
She...

426
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
I'm not gentle.

427
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
Are you all right?

428
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Auntie.

429
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,460
You can't go.

430
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,460
You have to give me an explanation.

431
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Zong Yi.

432
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,460
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,460
You have to give me an explanation.

434
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
Zong Yi.

435
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,460
My Zong Yi is so small.

436
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,460
What should I do?

437
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Auntie.

438
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
I'll help you get up first.

439
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,460
Get up first, okay?

440
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Get up first, Auntie.

441
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Come on.

442
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
You go first.

443
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
Don't worry about me.

444
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
I can't go.

445
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
I can't go.

446
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Let's go.

447
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
I can't go.

448
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,460
I can't go.

449
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
I can't go.

450
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,460
I can't go.

451
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,460
I can't go.

452
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Can I stay with her for a while?

453
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
Auntie.

454
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
If you have anything to say, tell me.

455
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Okay?

456
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
I can't go.

457
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
I can't go.

458
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
I can't go.

459
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
If you have anything to say, tell me.

460
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
Let's go in first.

461
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,460
Auntie.

462
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
Let's go in first.

463
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Captain Luo.

464
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Thank you for my brother's matter.

465
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
You're welcome.

466
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
We all follow the rules.

467
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Captain Luo.

468
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
What are you talking about?

469
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,460
If you hadn't helped Dong Lan to clear the suspicion,

470
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,460
he would have been hard to get out of the special investigation team.

471
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
Who told you he could clear the suspicion?

472
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
We're not enough to help you.

473
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
We must let go when the time comes.

474
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
Is he your boyfriend?

475
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Yes.

476
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,460
I'm a lawyer.

477
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
I'll be in contact with Captain Luo.

478
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,460
This is my business card.

479
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
You're a lawyer.

480
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
I'm from the special investigation team.

481
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,460
It's only right that we don't interact with each other.

482
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
I think the relationship between Zhou Dong Lan and Zhang Dong Lan

483
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,460
is not bad.

484
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Was he also in Chengguan Public Relations on the day of the crime?

485
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
I've known Dong Lan for a long time.

486
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
That's why he calls me every time.

487
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Come on, pick me.

488
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Thank you.

489
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Captain Luo.

490
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
Let me change your card.

491
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Is there anything different?

492
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
Actually, it's not that important.

493
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
It's just a custom in our hometown.

494
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
After a pack of cigarettes is opened,

495
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
pick one and put it back.

496
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Make a wish.

497
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
This one must be picked by yourself in the end.

498
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
The wish can be fulfilled.

499
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
There's such a custom?

500
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
It's common.

501
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
Yang Yang.

502
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Let's go. I'm so sleepy.

503
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,460
Captain Luo.

504
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Goodbye.

505
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
Captain Luo, see you next time.

506
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Everyone should be present at the scene

507
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
at the night.

508
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,460
Everyone should be there.

509
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
I understand.

510
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
Why are you still here?

511
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,460
I said I would send him to the reception.

512
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,460
He refused.

513
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
He said he wanted to guard you

514
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
and catch the murderer.

515
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460
It's not a big deal to sleep here.

516
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
I'm fine.

517
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Aunt.

518
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Aunt.

519
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Aunt.

520
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Officer Cheng.

521
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,460
My son.

522
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,460
The murderer was caught.

523
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Not yet.

524
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
But we've been investigating.

525
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Aunt.

526
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Let me take you to the reception first.

527
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
It's next door.

528
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
I'll take you there tomorrow.

529
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
Okay?

530
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
Wait.

531
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Aunt.

532
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Did I mention someone to you?

533
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
His name is Feng Mian Guo.

534
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
No.

535
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
Then it's okay.

536
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,900
We've been investigating place in places around the aspect that

537
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,460
he had been Sab plastic surgery.

538
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,460
In the pocket of Complimentsoft August

539
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,060
your son is dead.

540
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,160
and Top Th ноo

541
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,460
as I know.

542
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
That's right.

543
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
The crime scene at the street is just so ambiguous

544
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,460
and aggressive.

545
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,460
How about to go to the reception?

546
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
You did it on purpose, right?

547
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,860
You said you released Zhang Donglai because you lack evidence.

548
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,260
But you went to check the surveillance footage of Chengguan Public Administration.

549
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,660
He must have a proof.

550
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Who told you?

551
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,260
No one needs to tell me about this.

552
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,460
Just use your brain.

553
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,460
I say, Director Pei, aren't you being too shallow?

554
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,660
Don't you need your commander to lead your country?

555
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
If you have nothing else, go to bed.

556
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,860
Don't mind your own business.

557
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Enough.

558
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,060
What's going on between you two? Why are you starting again?

559
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,860
How is Auntie?

560
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
She's calm emotionally.

561
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,060
But she feels like we won't be able to handle the case well.

562
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,660
Oh, right. I just asked.

563
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,660
She said she never heard He Zongyi mention

564
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,260
any special person in her heart.

565
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,860
She never mentioned those 100,000 yuan.

566
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,660
Who is she?

567
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Why is she acting so mysterious?

568
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,660
I don't know.

569
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,660
We can only start from Zhang Donglai's name list.

570
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,260
I...

571
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,460
What's wrong?

572
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,260
Nothing. Forget it.

573
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,460
You have something to say?

574
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,260
I want to ask you for a leave.

575
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,660
I won't be eating in the team tonight.

576
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,860
A leave? Where are you going?

577
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,260
I...

578
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,060
I...

579
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm going on a blind date.

580
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,460
You're going on a blind date?

581
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,660
Brother,

582
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,260
are you going on a blind date?

583
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,660
The boss is not young. He introduced me to someone.

584
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,260
I...

585
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,060
I...

586
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Pei Su, I'm fine.

587
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
You don't have to say that to me.

588
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,060
You've taken care of me enough all these years.

589
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,060
It's time to move on.

590
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,060
But before I become my sister-in-law,

591
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,660
I have to see her first.

592
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,860
You're going on a blind date?

593
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,660
You're only wearing this?

594
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,660
Is it important?

595
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,060
What's important is what car you drive after dinner.

596
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,060
Do you want to borrow my car?

597
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,260
Let's go.

598
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,260
Let's go.

599
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,860
You don't eat cooked food.

600
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,260
You don't eat cooked food.

601
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,460
You don't eat sour food, spicy food, or mixed oil.

602
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,660
You don't eat plant-based food.

603
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,260
You don't eat eggplant and tomato with skin.

604
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,860
You don't eat animal's knees,

605
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,460
neck, and intestines.

606
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,060
You don't eat boiled egg yolk

607
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,660
and braised tofu.

608
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,060
What about the fried food? You don't eat shrimp?

609
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,060
I don't like oil. It's troublesome.

610
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,960
Where is the sweet one?

611
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
The sweet one.

612
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,660
Is it OK?

613
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,060
I don't know how you got me here.

614
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
You're even worse than my cat.

615
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Just treat me like a cat.

616
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,060
I'm not a cat.

617
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
I'm a dog.

618
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,060
I'm a dog.

619
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
I'm a dog.

620
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
I'm a dog.

621
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Come on, Mr. Pei.

622
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
Eat shrimp.

623
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
I think...

624
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
it's all Tao Ze's fault.

625
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
As long as you say you want shrimp,

626
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
he can run out and buy it for you in the middle of the night.

627
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,060
If this is my house,

628
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
then you only have time to eat noodles.

629
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm sorry.

630
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
Before I went to college,

631
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,060
I often went to Tao Ze's house.

632
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
I think I've disturbed her.

633
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
It's not true.

634
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,060
I often thought at that time,

635
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
if she got married one day,

636
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
and had children,

637
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,060
I couldn't go to her house often.

638
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,060
Don't do it.

639
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,060
My psychologist said,

640
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
friends move into the family or move away from home,

641
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
relatives gradually get old,

642
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
or they have to part with each other.

643
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
It's not a big deal.

644
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
It's like natural rules,

645
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
objective and permanent.

646
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
It doesn't mean anything.

647
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,060
It's too deep.

648
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,060
It's like being too deep.

649
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
It doesn't mean anything.

650
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
The world is changing.

651
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
People are changing.

652
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,060
So are we.

653
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,060
It's illogical to refuse to part

654
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,060
and to refuse to change.

655
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
So I gradually figured it out.

656
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Tao Ze was right.

657
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,060
I can't let go of the past.

658
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Look at the psychologist.

659
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,060
Are you still dreaming?

660
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
No.

661
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,060
It's gone.

662
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
Hello, who is it?

663
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Help! Help!

664
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
Hello?

665
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
Hello.

666
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
The number you dialed

667
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,060
I'm busy.

668
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
I'm leaving.

669
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Hello?

670
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
Okay, I'll be there soon.

671
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
You eat first.

672
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,060
I'll be there when I'm done eating.

673
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
I'm leaving first.

674
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
Thank you.

675
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Same old, same old.

676
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,060
Still the same as before.

677
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Nothing has changed.

678
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
I'm leaving.

679
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Hello, Boss?

680
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,060
Xiao Wu, find someone to help me locate two phone numbers.

681
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,060
The base station, 239911, 69511.

682
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,060
Another strange number, 2360003, 1212.

683
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,060
I predict that the range of these two people's interactions should be below.

684
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Hurry!

685
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
I'm leaving.

686
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
Boss, I found it.

687
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
His name is Hu Xue Chun.

688
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Hu Xue Chun?

689
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Yes.

690
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
His identity information has been sent to your phone.

691
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,060
Is there a connection?

692
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
What's wrong?

693
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Is there a problem, Boss?

694
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,460
The

695
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
location of my location will be located on my phone.

696
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
What do you mean, Boss?

697
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Where are you?

698
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,060
Xiao Wu, don't ask.

699
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
Xiao Wu, don't ask.

700
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
I'm not asking.

701
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,060

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
I'm just asking.

759
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
I'm just asking.

760
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I'm just asking.

761
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
I'm just asking.

762
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
I'm just asking.

763
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
I'm just asking.

764
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
I'm just asking.

765
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,060
I'm just asking.

766
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
I'm just asking.

767
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm just asking.

768
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
I'm just asking.

769
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm just asking.

770
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
I'm just asking.

771
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,060
I'm just asking.

772
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
I'm just asking.

773
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
I'm just asking.

774
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
I'm just asking.

775
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
I'm just asking.

776
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
I'm just asking.

777
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
I'm just asking.

778
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I'm just asking.

779
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
I'm just asking.

780
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
I'm just asking.

781
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm just asking.

782
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm just asking.

783
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm just asking.

784
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Such a Lordsman.

785
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,060
Ready, set, begin.

786
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Hello, welcome.

787
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,860
I'm sorry.

788
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
I'm sorry.

789
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm sorry.

790
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm sorry.

791
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I'm sorry.

792
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I'm sorry.

793
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,140
Hello, welcome.

794
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,020
Order a high-end.

795
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,380
A few friends will come later.

796
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,100
How many customers are there?

797
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
How many waiters are there?

798
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
Look at the photo first.

799
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,220
This photo

800
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,380
can't even recognize mom.

801
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,260
Is there anything normal?

802
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,060
Do you have a person

803
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,380
called Hu Xuechun?

804
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,220
What?

805
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,340
Nothing.

806
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,340
Here's the thing.

807
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,580
The waiters here

808
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,020
usually use the name of the person.

809
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,260
You suddenly said your name.

810
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,100
I can't react.

811
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,820
Hu Xuechun seems to be Linda.

812
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,140
Your corporate culture

813
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,380
is quite international.

814
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,580
Sir, Linda is a little uncomfortable today.

815
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,860
Why don't you look at others?

816
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,780
Or you knew her before?

817
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,580
Uncomfortable?

818
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,540
What are you looking for?

819
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,780
I want Linda.

820
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,660
OK.

821
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,140
Then I'll contact Linda for you

822
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,260
and let her be in charge of your room.

823
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,060
Wu Xiancheng, Wu Xiancheng.

824
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,820
Roger that.

825
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,580
Please take this gentleman to Wu Xiancheng.

826
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,060
OK.

827
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Sir, come with me.

828
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,020
Sir, this way please.

829
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,540
Good evening, sir.

830
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,700
Good evening, sir.

831
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,620
This way.

832
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,020
Sir, we're here.

833
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,980
This is the last room in the corridor.

834
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,500
This is not a good place.

835
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,380
It's OK, sir.

836
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:23,460
This is the

837
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,260
you see a little rowdy.

838
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,580
You look

839
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,500
at the politics

840
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,000
Last night you were saying that my daughter

841
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,480
You must have seen through some of these

842
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,700
You Australian

843
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,440
It's these

844
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,560
You've think so much

845
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,780
What are you thinking about?

846
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,100
Find a way to get out of here

847
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,000
I haven'tides

848
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,200
That's it

849
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,920
Go

850
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,820
Go

851
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,900
Go

852
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,440
Go

853
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,660
Go

854
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,220
Go

855
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,380
Get

856
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,860
Go

857
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:00,920
Go

858
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:01,560
Hello

859
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,860
Hi there I am Linda

860
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:10,780
Sit

861
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,460
Brother is pouring under-dog

862
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,380
Airlines must be lots of customers

863
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,160
Maybe we can have some .

864
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
They're all on you.

865
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
And they're causing trouble.

866
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Why are your eyes so red?

867
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,540
Shuai, let's order.

868
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,420
Drink first.

869
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
Come on, drink more.

870
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
Okay.

871
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
Here, drink one.

872
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,160
Shuai, don't. I'll have that.

873
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
This woman is Zhao.

874
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
Boss.

875
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
What's wrong?

876
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
What do you mean?

877
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
What are you doing here?

878
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Come and sit.

879
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Why did you bring her here?

880
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
Boss, do you want to?

881
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
Wait a minute.

882
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
This is a special team.

883
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
How long have you been working here?

884
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Do you have a boyfriend?

885
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Not for a year.

886
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Do you have a better boyfriend?

887
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
Yes.

888
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
There's one.

889
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
He's my old neighbor.

890
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
I was entangled in my work.

891
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
He helped me.

892
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
And he always took care of me.

893
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
But what's the point?

894
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,500
I'm from here.

895
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
He must hate me.

896
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
Hate you?

897
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Do you still have a relationship?

898
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Is he stable now?

899
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Yes.

900
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
But I'm too ashamed to see him.

901
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
As long as he's fine,

902
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
I'll be satisfied.

903
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
What does he do?

904
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I just ask.

905
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
See if I have a chance.

906
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I don't know.

907
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Just do it.

908
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
I heard that

909
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
he has a child.

910
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
He left home a while ago.

911
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,500
He's looking for him all over the world.

912
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
That child

913
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,500
came here a while ago.

914
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
He seems to have had a boyfriend.

915
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
He asked me about it.

916
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
The child disappeared.

917
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Why didn't you report it?

918
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
It's useless.

919
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
No one cares.

920
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
There's an address

921
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
on the child's workbook.

922
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
It's nearby.

923
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,500
He also asked me.

924
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Luo has been

925
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
with this woman for a few minutes.

926
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Why hasn't he finished?

927
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
He's a spy.

928
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
He knows that child is fine.

929
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
He doesn't dare to act rashly.

930
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
How's Chen Chen?

931
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Is he obedient?

932
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
I gave him a shot.

933
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
I'll go and see him.

934
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Go.

935
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
He can't be beaten up.

936
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
He can't find Chen Chen.

937
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
He won't leave.

938
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,500
No.

939
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,500
Let him go.

940
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
Boss.

941
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,500
Something happened.

942
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
He's dead.

943
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
What?

944
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Chen Chen is dead.

945
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
Who told you to move?

946
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Who told you to move?

947
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Boss.

948
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
We just hit him a little.

949
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
It's okay to hit these grandchildren.

950
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
