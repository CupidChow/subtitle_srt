1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,220
how about me?

2
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,700
I am veryмет up

3
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,860
Don't worry

4
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,700
I am fed up

5
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,980
Don't worry

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,240
Don't worry

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,800
No

8
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,980
Brother

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,480
I feel bad

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
Tieencing Music

11
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Boss,

12
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,520
There's a spy.

13
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't worry.

14
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,600
How about disелейing the money

15
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,640
and finding other runs of Vijay Jho's foil?

16
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,920
Besides, that house is so small.

17
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,280
It's okay to live there for a day or two.

18
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
It's not suitable for you to keep living there.

19
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
Take your car.

20
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,880
What's going on?

21
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,560
You want to kill me?

22
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,600
The

23
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
The

24
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
The

25
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
The

26
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
The

27
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
The

28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
The

29
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
The

30
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
The

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
The

32
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
The

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Excuse me, Mr. Lu.

34
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,600
The car that was stolen by my subordinate at midnight.

35
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Did you say something?

36
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I haven't seen this brother.

37
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
I'll introduce you.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Hello, sir.

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm Du Jia.

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Mr. Pei is my boss.

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Misunderstanding.

42
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
What are you doing at Mr. Pei's house?

43
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Do everything.

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
The main species

45
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
May be excavated.

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Is this a robot?

47
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm going to ask you something.

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Go back and talk.

49
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
What's going on?

50
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
What's going on?

51
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
What's going on?

52
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
What's going on?

53
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
We were talking.

54
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,680
Do you want to play a game?

55
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
Do you want to play Hello Kitty?

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,120
I've been to the basement.

57
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,120
I know everything.

58
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,360
That villa.

59
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,960
That basement.

60
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,560
Pei Su.

61
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,240
Let me ask you.

62
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,640
Since you're a normal person,

63
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
you don't know the pervert of love and hate,

64
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,640
why do you have

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,680
such a complicated and complicated equipment?

66
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
I've been working in the first-tier hospital for so many years.

67
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
I've never seen anyone

68
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,880
who likes to make trouble for himself.

69
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,000
And the wound on your body

70
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,160
was left when you were a pilot, right?

71
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,920
Aren't you afraid of being hit by a internal injury?

72
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
Aren't you afraid of being careless

73
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,320
and dying in your basement

74
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
without any reason?

75
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,560
What do you want?

76
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,760
I don't mean anything else.

77
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,480
I just want to tell you.

78
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
In my place,

79
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
you'll never be the pervert you talk about.

80
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,000
I want to know

81
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,440
why.

82
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,640
Have you ever been

83
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
angry at me?

84
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,280
When I'm angry,

85
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,200
you've always been my fantasy partner.

86
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,200
I thought I could use a Avenue,

87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,160
give you a hard time by finding you inside.

88
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
But then,

89
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Tao Zi didn't say anything at that time.

90
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
We didn't care.

91
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Teacher Pei, did you buy you a cold fish?

92
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
No one cares about this detail.

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
What are you doing?

94
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Yes.

95
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Later, Tao Zi told me that you went to several market

96
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
and bought the same pen and paper.

97
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
You mentioned it so carefully

98
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
because you were afraid that the master of the market would see it.

99
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
I thought that although you were always in the way,

100
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
sometimes it hurts.

101
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,680
If you go wrong, you will be late for work.

102
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
So I was always strict with you.

103
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,680
I didn't go back and forth with anyone

104
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
when I was with you.

105
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,680
You were obviously having a fight with a group of friends

106
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
in the special team that day.

107
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I was always in the way.

108
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
But in the end,

109
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
I was always with He Zong Yi's mother.

110
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I didn't understand at that time.

111
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
I thought you were pretending.

112
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,680
I really understood until I was in the basement.

113
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Even if you said it to yourself,

114
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
you lack compassion in your instinct.

115
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,680
But you still have pity for this world.

116
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
So I thought,

117
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
even if I didn't care about you,

118
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
I would treat you every day.

119
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
You also don't love me.

120
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
That's right.

121
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
I am a person

122
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,680
who is sometimes hard-hearted and doesn't care about you.

123
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
I am not sharp enough in observation.

124
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Many times in the past,

125
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I may have missed your help,

126
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
entrust,

127
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
or even trust.

128
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
I regret it.

129
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
I let you walk in the dark for so long.

130
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
But this time,

131
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I will stop you.

132
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
I will definitely do it.

133
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
I will definitely do it.

134
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
About you,

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
I have a story in the basement.

136
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
You can tell me when you want to.

137
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
If you still don't believe me,

138
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
don't want to be honest with me,

139
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
it doesn't matter.

140
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
I understand.

141
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
I don't want to force you.

142
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
I don't want to make you embarrassed.

143
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
It's late.

144
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Have a rest.

145
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
Senior.

146
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
That basement room

147
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
used to belong to Pei Zhongyu.

148
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
I don't know where he is.

149
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I don't know where he is.

150
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
I don't know where he is.

I don't know where he is.

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
I don't know where he is.

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't know where he is.

156
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
I don't know where he is.

157
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
I don't know where he is.

158
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,680
I don't know where he is.

159
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
I don't know where he is.

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
I don't know where he is.

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't know where he is.

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I don't know where he is.

00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
I don't know where he is.

I don't know where he is.

I don't know where he is.

166
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
I don't know where he is.

167
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
I don't know where he is.

168
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
I don't know where he is.

169
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
I don't know where he is.

I don't know where he is.

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
The Long Ballad

191
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Episode 1

192
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
The Long Ballad

193
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
The Long Ballad

194
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
The Long Ballad

195
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
The Long Ballad

196
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
The Long Ballad

197
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Pei Chang Yu is that kind of person.

198
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
He is the most dangerous person

199
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
among the spiritual leaders.

200
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
In his world,

201
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
except himself,

202
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
everyone else is just

203
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
a wild animal

204
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
that has his own killing power.

205
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
He can control everything.

206
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Just like the owner can kill a bug.

207
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
At home,

208
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
he is everything.

209
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
If my mom breaks his rules,

210
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
she will be dragged into the basement to punish him.

211
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Since I was a child,

212
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
I've been thinking about getting rid of him.

213
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
But I've always thought that I've never done anything

214
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
until he committed suicide.

215
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
He was trapped in the devil's cage.

216
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
There was only me

217
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
beside him.

218
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Before he slept,

219
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Pei Chang Yu asked me to read an hour's book.

220
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
He spent two years

221
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
to mix his words

222
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
into the reading books.

223
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
He tried to tell me

224
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
the concept of freedom.

225
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Maybe it's because I inherited his genes.

226
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
His reaction was too cold.

227
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
So until he finished the last book,

228
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
he finally showed me

229
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
what freedom is.

230
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Freedom of thought.

231
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm sorry.

232
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Actually, I knew he committed suicide

233
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
from the beginning.

234
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
I didn't agree with his suicide conclusion

235
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
and kept pestering you

236
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
and forcing you to investigate.

237
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I just wanted to use you

238
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
to make trouble for Pei Chang Yu and them.

239
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
They?

240
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Do you know what is

241
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
the relationship between the two?

242
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
I don't know.

243
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
It's the relationship between the two.

244
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
You gave him nutrients,

245
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
carbon dioxide and water.

246
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,680
He gave you the protection of the sea.

247
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Pei Chang Yu had a

248
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
parasite like this.

249
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
The parasite you mentioned

250
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
is just a fund, right?

251
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
But the company is a shell.

252
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
It has no value.

253
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
The person who really

254
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
controls everything in the dark

255
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
is the real parasite.

256
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
How did you know about this?

257
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Pei Chang Yu didn't

258
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
avoid you in these things?

259
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
It's about

260
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
my grandfather's death.

261
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
My grandfather got the news

262
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
that my mother was pregnant.

263
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
He couldn't help but want to see her.

264
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
The car hit him.

265
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
A car hit him.

266
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Does it sound

267
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
like a version of Zhou's music?

268
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
I asked Pei Chang Yu

269
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
I said,

270
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,680
what if someone suspected the driver's background?

271
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
What if someone suspected that

272
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,680
it was not an accident,

273
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,680
but a deliberate murder?

274
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,640
As a heritage beneficiary,

275
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,520
Pei Cheng Yu was too suspicious.

276
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Pei Cheng Yu said to me in a strange way.

277
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,080
These things are handled by professionals.

278
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,720
It won't be judged.

279
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,680
This is the first time I've heard from him

280
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
the existence of the organization.

281
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Pei Cheng Yu regularly sends money to the organization.

282
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
And these people,

283
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
whether it's illegal crime,

284
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
murder, or murder,

285
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
in short, they will do everything

286
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
to clear all his obstacles.

287
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Pei Cheng Yu once told me

288
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
that this organization

289
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
is a treasure knife in his hand.

290
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
He can pass it on to me in the future.

291
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
I can take it now.

292
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
But don't worry.

293
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Don't worry.

294
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
I can't get this knife.

295
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Because Pei Cheng Yu

296
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
is against this knife.

297
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
They are in trouble

298
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
because of the plan to go to the ice beach.

299
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Through the case of the Su family,

300
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
we can't reject the purpose of the ice beach.

301
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
If it's just to build

302
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
a private powder factory for rent,

303
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
it shouldn't violate your father's interests.

304
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
No.

305
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
On the contrary,

306
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
it's the ice and sea project

307
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
that makes Pei Cheng Yu feel uneasy.

308
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Pei Cheng Yu is a monster

309
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
who is extremely strong

310
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
and extremely self-reliant.

311
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
He wants to establish his own system.

312
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
He will never allow anything

313
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
to go beyond his control.

314
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
He is organizing

315
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
the behavior of this circle

316
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
and the powder factory.

317
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
He is predicted

318
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
that they are not satisfied

319
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
with the knife in his hand.

320
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
The organization is using

321
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
the ice and sea project

322
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
to build a huge network

323
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
to attract all the people

324
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
who are hiding in the dark

325
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
and to hold them in their hands

326
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,680
to establish their own kingdom and order.

327
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
So, at first,

328
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Pei Cheng Yu thought

329
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
he had raised this monster by himself.

330
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
But he didn't expect

331
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
that after he raised it,

332
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
he planned to build his own store

333
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
and make Pei Cheng Yu

334
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
a common partner.

335
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Is that what you mean?

336
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
But Pei Cheng Yu refused to pay.

337
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
They still took away that land.

338
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
The organization found

339
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
other sponsors.

340
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Do you remember what Zhou Huai Jing

341
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
said in the interrogation room?

342
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Twenty years ago,

343
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
he heard that Zheng Kaifeng

344
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
and Zhou Junhao were secretly

345
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
talking about a murder case

346
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
of a fake city.

347
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
If Zhou Huai Jing didn't lie,

348
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
then this organization

349
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
has been building

350
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
more than one gold mine from the beginning.

351
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Pei Cheng Yu

352
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
is such a person

353
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
who thinks he is a bad guy.

354
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
He might not be able to

355
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
see through the truth.

356
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Are you done?

357
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Is it my turn?

358
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
What do you mean?

359
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Don't you want to know

360
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
what my master Yang Zheng Feng

361
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
wrote in his heart?

362
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
How did I get it?

363
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
How did you know that Qi Ming read it?

364
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
When you found out

365
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Jun Hao's case,

366
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
you already knew it.

367
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
Everyone thinks that

368
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Ma Er Kang and Dao Na Ben

369
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
killed their kind father.

370
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
What?

371
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Did Luo De Yue see this scene?

372
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Actually, when Xu Dong Yu's case was on,

373
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
I was hinting at you.

374
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Maybe someone told Su Ruowan

375
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
about the details

376
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
in the pencil and the bell.

377
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
I was already suspecting

378
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
your reaction.

379
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
So, Senior,

380
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,680
how did you start to notice

381
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Qi Ming read it?

382
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
The sample...

383
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
The sample...

384
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
28 days...

385
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I don't know

386
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
where did Yang find this ID.

387
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
But you said

388
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
there was an organization

389
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
that provides the service

390
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
of murdering people.

391
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
I was sure of a guess.

392
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Yang found this organization

393
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
with some clues

394
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
provided by the cleaners.

395
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
He was very careful,

396
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
but they found out.

397
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Then,

398
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
they created his death

399
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
with a perfect accident.

400
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
There's only one thing

401
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
I don't understand.

402
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
What role

403
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
did the cleaners play?

404
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
What were their goals?

405
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I had a guess.

406
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
I don't know if you heard it.

407
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Senior, don't you think it's strange?

408
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Why did Du Guosheng

409
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
let Xia Xin'nan go?

410
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Isn't it obvious

411
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
that he told the special investigation team

412
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
about this girl

413
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
and wanted you to interrogate her?

414
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
And,

415
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
who told Su Ruowan

416
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
about the details of the case?

417
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Why did she suddenly

418
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
imitate Su Lin'nan

419
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
and the case of Su Lin'nan

420
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
and the case of Su Lin'nan

421
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
that happened many years ago?

422
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
I think

423
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
many seniors

424
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
want to know

425
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
the mystery of the case.

426
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I think

427
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
the case of Su Lin'nan

428
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
is a very important case.

429
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
I think

430
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
the mystery of the case

431
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
is a very important case.

432
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
I have a reasonable explanation.

433
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Do you want to hear it?

434
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
It's not a good idea.

435
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
That is, some people

436
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
know that they may be used by you,

437
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
but they still provide clues

438
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
to the special investigation team

439
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
and let you keep investigating.

440
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Those organizations that

441
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
are confused and make mistakes

442
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
and almost expose themselves

443
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
three times

444
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
in a row

445
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
will eventually be out of control.

446
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
The direct-intentioned cleaners

447
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
will be pushed out

448
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
as a shield.

449
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
But these cleaners

450
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
are not too many.

451
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Because there are not many real perverts.

452
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
And

453
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
the more money they have,

454
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
the more they can afford

455
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
to be rich.

456
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
When these people

457
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
seek for self-protection

458
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
and cut themselves

459
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
into a official commander,

460
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
they will break through

461
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
the need for new funds

462
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
and find new investors.

463
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
For example...

464
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Shut up.

465
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Shut up.

466
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
For example, the successor of Pei Cheng Yu

467
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
I...

468
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I meet all their requirements.

469
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
And I should have been

470
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
one of them.

471
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
If it weren't for

472
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
the fight with them before,

473
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
I would have

474
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
taken this knife long ago.

475
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
And

476
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
I've been thinking about

477
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
making Pei Cheng Yu

478
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
a born leader-in-chief.

479
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
He wouldn't have

480
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
pursued the so-called killer.

481
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Moreover,

482
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I sneaked into the special investigation team

483
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
and participated in the investigation

484
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
of the water and water station.

485
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I was blinded by it.

486
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Shut up.

487
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
In fact, the organization

488
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
has been trying to

489
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
contact me before.

490
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
But I never answered.

491
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Because I didn't want to show

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
that he knew about the money.

493
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
But if they

494
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
try to

495
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
get into the new gold and gold,

496
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
they will soon

497
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
become four-faced.

498
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
They will break through the need

499
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
for new funds.

500
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Then they can only

501
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
kneel on the ground

502
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
and beg me for help.

503
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I have a chance to

504
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
break their wings

505
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
and make this parasite

506
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
completely

507
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
become my guard dog.

508
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
I'm afraid this is

509
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
what Pei Cheng Yu

510
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
always wanted to do,

511
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
but failed.

512
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
They have contacted you.

513
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
When did it happen?

514
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Why didn't you tell me?

515
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Maybe because

516
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
I haven't prepared

517
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
for the death.

518
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Let go.

519
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
I said I was going to hold you.

520
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Why did you say

521
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
you were suspicious?

522
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Senior.

523
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I haven't told you yet

524
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
that the investment agreement

525
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
of Qi Ming Yue Du

526
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
was made in the basement

527
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
of Pei Cheng Yu's.

528
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
No matter what,

529
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I'm the biggest suspect

530
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
of the invaders.

531
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
The new intern

532
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
from Xinzhou

533
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
who is a psychology master

534
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
and a new student

535
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
of Xinzhou Political and Legal Affairs.

536
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Captain Luo.

537
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
He has entered the special investigation.

538
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Is he also

539
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
holding other purposes?

540
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
I think I lost my watch.

541
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Have you seen it?

542
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,680
It should be in the study.

543
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
This is

544
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
the dead body.

545
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
What?

546
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Has Captain Luo

547
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
seen this scene?

548
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
If it can be

549
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
the development area

550
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
of the humanoid robot,

551
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
it will be great.

552
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
The murderer

553
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
committed a serial murder

554
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
in 327.

555
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
He has been wanted for 10 years.

556
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
But he failed.

557
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Do you want to know

558
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
what the sign of this pen is?

559
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
I don't believe it.

560
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I don't believe

561
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
a person who doesn't trust

562
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Zhou Yan and He Zong Yi

563
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
will be the one

564
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
who led Zhou Hong Chuan

565
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
to kill his son.

566
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
I don't believe

567
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
a person who has been

568
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
involved in this several times

569
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
will be the one

570
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,680
who led Zhou Hong Chuan

571
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
to kill his son.

572
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I don't believe

573
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,680
a person who will die for Zhou Huai Xing

574
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
and who is sad

575
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
will be the one

576
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
who led Dou Xiao Qing

577
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
to kill his son.

578
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I don't believe

579
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
you will deliberately

580
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
lead Feng Bin to resist

581
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
and watch him

582
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
being killed by Du Guo Sheng.

583
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Pei Su,

584
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I don't believe

585
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
you will be the one

586
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
who led Zhou Hong Chuan

587
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
to kill his son.

588
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Don't use your

589
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
secret strategy

590
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
to fool me.

591
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
You know

592
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I don't believe in these.

593
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
I only believe

594
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
in a person's will to be free.

595
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I believe you.

596
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
You are not the same as them.

597
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
I believe you.

598
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
You can trust me.

599
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Since you said that,

600
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
can I ask you

601
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
to help me?

602
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
What?

603
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
You will know later.

604
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Whoever can

605
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
stop life from going out

606
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
will become a new person.

607
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Whoever can

608
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
overcome pain and fear

609
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
will become the master.

610
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Even the best person

611
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
can't do that.

612
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
There is no pain in stone,

613
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
but there is pain

614
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
in the fear of stone.

615
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
The master is the pain

616
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,680
caused by the fear of death.

617
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Whoever can overcome

618
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
pain and fear

619
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,680
will become the best person.

620
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Then

621
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
a new life will appear.

622
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Then a new person will appear.

623
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Everything

624
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
is new.

625
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Today,

626
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
I wrote this letter

627
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
to tell everyone

628
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
what really happened

629
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
in this wall.

630
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
I'm sorry.

631
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm sorry.

632
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm sorry.

633
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I'm sorry.

634
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
I'm sorry.

635
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
I'm sorry.

636
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
I'm sorry.

637
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm sorry.

638
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
I'm sorry.

639
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm sorry.

640
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm sorry.

641
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
I'm sorry.

642
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
I'm sorry.

643
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
I'm sorry.

644
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
I'm sorry.

645
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm sorry.

646
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
I'm sorry.

647
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I'm sorry.

648
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
I'm sorry.

649
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I'm sorry.

650
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
I was very scared,

651
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
so I blocked my eyes

652
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
and pretended not to see

653
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
and covered my ears

654
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I want to say that we are all wrong.

655
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,080
We should all say sorry to him.

656
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,680
I want to apologize to my classmates, friends, parents,

657
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,080
and the family of the lost classmate.

658
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I want to say sorry to them.

659
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,680
I know it's too late.

660
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Sir, don't call people here to ask questions.

661
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,680
We are here to talk about the situation.

662
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Can you ask Wang Xiao to come here and talk to us?

663
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
He can come here once, but twice.

664
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Do you think he is a thief?

665
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Don't talk nonsense. Let's go.

666
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
You can contact me anytime.

667
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Wait for me.

668
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Wang Xiao's parents?

669
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Yes.

670
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,680
The victim ran faster than the reporter.

671
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Boss, if Wang Xiao doesn't want to show up,

672
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
we should just let him be.

673
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Besides, this is a big and small matter.

674
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Our focus is still on Feng Bin's case.

675
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
You are right.

676
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
But the case is a case.

677
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Other cases are also cases.

678
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,680
We can't just split the case into two.

679
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,680
The SED's principle of work never has a big and small case.

680
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Yes.

681
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
All right.

682
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
When Wen Wenxuan comes, I will go to interrogate him.

683
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
I will go to the dormitory with Wang Xiao.

684
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Okay.

685
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Boss, there is someone waiting for you in your office.

686
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Captain Luo.

687
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,680
You are not at home.

688
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Come and sit here.

689
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,680
Captain Luo, I wrote the inspection.

690
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Please go back.

691
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,680
You can go back after writing the inspection?

692
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
You are at home.

693
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Go and stay here.

694
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
I...

695
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Boss, Wei Wenxuan is here.

696
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Go.

697
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Let's go.

698
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
No need.

699
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
My house is not far.

700
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
I can go back.

701
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,680
I didn't say I would send you.

702
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
I want to go to that girl, Miss Wang.

703
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,680
But I forgot her registration address and door number.

704
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Do you remember?

705
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
I remember.

706
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,680
But I have already quit my job.

707
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Do you want to go?

708
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
This is it.

709
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Wang Xiao's home is here?

710
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Wang Xiao's parents have official jobs.

711
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
They work in a public company.

712
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Their income is not bad.

713
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
But for her to go abroad to study,

714
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,680
her parents have not given up a penny.

715
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Why did she have to study abroad?

716
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,680
It is said that it is because she couldn't keep up with her high school.

717
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,680
The teachers at the school are not good.

718
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
It is said that it is because she couldn't keep up with her high school.

719
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
The teachers at the school recommended her parents

720
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
to go to the community university to learn the skills.

721
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
In the future, it will be considered a one-time job.

722
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
But her parents quit one day.

723
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
They don't want her to go on her own old path.

724
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
They pursue her high school education.

725
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
They don't know where they found out about the 2 plus 2 channel of the jade.

726
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
They spent all the money to buy the house.

727
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
That's why they sent her in.

728
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
217, let's go.

729
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
Is someone there?

730
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,680
What is Huang Xiao?

731
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,680
We are the scouts in the special investigation team.

732
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
We're the scouts of the special investigation team.

733
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
You've probably seen this Officer Xiao before.

734
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,000
I know

735
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,120
you have something to tell us.

736
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,640
Don't open the door.

737
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,120
Didn't the officer tell you

738
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,000
not to open the door

739
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
to strangers when you're alone at home?

740
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,800
It's not safe.

741
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,120
How about this?

742
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,280
I'll write my phone number

743
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,800
on this piece of paper.

744
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,400
Then Officer Xiao and I

745
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,840
will go to your backyard and wait for you.

746
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,800
You can look at us from the window.

747
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,080
When you want to leave,

748
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,080
call this piece of paper.

749
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,760
Is that okay?

750
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
Why didn't you let him open the door?

751
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,720
Two strangers knock on the door.

752
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,280
No matter how big the door is,

753
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,200
girls will hesitate.

754
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,440
Moreover,

755
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,480
girls like Wang Xiao

756
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,200
won't open the door for us.

757
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,840
I guess

758
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,920
he has a knife chain

759
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,840
in his door.

760
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,720
He wants to

761
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,920
drive away from the door.

762
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,520
And the corridor is soundproofed.

763
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,240
The house next door is so dense.

764
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,640
I don't know how many ears are in the wall.

765
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,800
Under such a tense

766
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,480
soundproofed situation,

767
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Wang Xiao won't say anything.

768
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,440
So

769
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,120
I'll tell him the phone number.

770
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,480
It's also an initiative

771
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,280
to put it in his hands.

772
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,680
There is a anti-corrosive net outside their window.

773
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,880
He looks out of the window from the window.

774
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,840
The room itself

775
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,120
will also increase his sense of security.

776
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,960
Do you want to know what it is?

777
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
defeats

778
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,760
Reasons to特別調查

779
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,720
You love Chen dortside

780
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,240
Option it

781
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,040
Play game

782
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,400
Pellet

783
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:29,880
ен

784
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,880
You don't know this yet.

785
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,400
檢讨

786
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,080
Chen

787
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,320
Although there are

788
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,040
some strange things

789
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,160
What happened that day

790
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,160
например

791
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,920
The secret in Chen day

792
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,240
ini

793
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,960
My parents

794
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,680
Have already been to the top of the special investigation team this morning

795
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,640
I...

796
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I have nothing to say.

797
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I've answered all the questions.

798
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
I don't know about the others.

799
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
If there's nothing else, you can go.

800
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Do you know Xia Xinnan's goal of being selected this year?

801
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
If she doesn't run,

802
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
maybe in the future,

803
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
she will be bullied by others.

804
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
I know.

805
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Feng Bing said.

806
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,600
I said it.

807
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
How are you and Feng Bing and Xia Xinnan?

808
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Are you friends?

809
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
No.

810
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,600
I just said a few words to Feng Bing.

811
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
He helped me.

812
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Xia Xinnan is not familiar with me.

813
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
I...

814
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
I'm very lonely in school.

815
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
I don't like people.

816
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
I don't have friends.

817
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Since you're not friends,

818
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
why are you willing to run with them?

819
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
You know if Xia Xinnan changes your position,

820
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
those people who bully you will transfer their interest to her.

821
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
You will be much better in the future.

822
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
But even if you know they ran away,

823
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
you didn't tell anyone.

824
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
Right?

825
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Actually, sometimes,

826
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
you can't be free for four hours.

827
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
Because the outsiders are always

828
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
trying to hide you.

829
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
They will force you to accept the responsibility.

830
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,600
They will force you to listen to the most cruel opinion of that voice.

831
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
It's really illogical.

832
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
It doesn't fit the human nature.

833
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
It even defends your interests.

834
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
But as long as there is a little bit of survival on the battlefield,

835
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
there will always be a gentle voice, right?

836
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Just like before, he told you

837
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
to run away with Feng Bing and try to resist.

838
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
He told you to protect those

839
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
who are actually your classmates.

840
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
What about now?

841
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Does he want to pay the price

842
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
to those bad guys?

843
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
I...

844
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I heard about that person.

845
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
The murderer who killed Feng Bing.

846
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
What did you say?

847
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
You heard about it?

848
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Who told you?

849
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
I remember that we haven't

850
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
announced the identity of the murderer yet.

851
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
The murderer is still in the hospital.

852
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
I heard that he was killed by Feng Bing.

853
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
I heard that he was killed by Feng Bing.

854
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
What did you hear about the murderer?

855
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Once,

856
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,600
when we were in the special investigation team,

857
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
a sister asked me

858
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
if I had seen

859
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,600
a man in his forties

860
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
or over 40 years old outside.

861
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
She said

862
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
that he had a little bit of a pulse.

863
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
He looked very scary.

864
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I never left the hotel.

865
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
I've never seen him.

866
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
But...

867
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
I'm not sure.

868
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
It's okay.

869
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
Just tell me.

870
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
It's okay even if it's a misunderstanding.

871
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Once,

872
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
I heard Liang Yu Jing and the others

873
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
talking about

874
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Wei Wen Xuan's birthday party

875
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
in the bathroom.

876
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
What did Wei Wen Xuan's friend do?

877
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
He was so arrogant.

878
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,600
What did he do?

879
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
He was so arrogant.

880
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
He didn't drink water

881
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
for five minutes

882
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
and didn't take off his gloves.

883
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
I don't think he's a big guy.

884
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
He looked a little fierce

885
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
and had eyes.

886
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
It's scary.

887
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Where was it?

888
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Do you remember?

889
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
I don't know.

890
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
They didn't say.

891
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
I remember

892
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
a girl said

893
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
the restaurant's

894
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Fu Tao Qiang was very unprofessional.

895
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
There was a piece of cabbage in it.

896
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
She laughed so hard.

897
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Liang Yu Jing

898
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
always liked Wei Wen Xuan.

899
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
She was so angry when she heard that.

900
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,600
She told him not to talk nonsense.

901
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
She said that he was making

902
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,600
a change.

903
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I know.

904
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
Long Yun Cheng.

905
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Thank you.

906
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Thank you.

907
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
You've done a great job.

908
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
I...

909
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I...

910
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
I'm ugly.

911
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,600
I'm bad at studying.

912
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm not good at being a part of the team.

913
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
And I always drag my parents down.

914
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
I'm so glad

915
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
to be part of the team.

916
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,600
I'm so happy

917
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,600
that I can become a part of the team.

918
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
Thank you.

919
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,600
and always drag my parents down.

920
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
They said

921
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
we still live in a place like this.

922
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,600
It's all because of me.

923
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
They make me work hard every day.

924
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
But I just can't make it.

925
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
I also spent so much money at home.

926
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,600
I don't even know if I can go abroad now.

927
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
People like me

928
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
should die.

929
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
You...

930
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
I was weird when I was a kid.

931
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Now I'm even more weird.

932
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Maybe it's because I was born with it.

933
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,600
Since I was a kid,

934
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,600
no one liked to play with me.

935
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
I didn't have a good relationship with my colleagues.

936
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,600
When my parents divorced,

937
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,600
my dad said that

938
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
I was a bad son to my mom.

939
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,600
I was a bad son to my mom.

940
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
I was a bad son to my mom.

941
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
I was a bad son to my mom.

942
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
My dad told my mom that

943
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
I should take this thunderbolt away

944
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,600
and give you more money.

945
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
I was useless all the time.

946
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
Look.

947
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
I entered SID

948
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
and became a scout.

949
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,600
But one day,

950
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
I went home after work

951
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,600
and saw a thief.

952
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,600
I wanted to catch him.

953
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
But he pushed me to the ground

954
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,600
and saw him escape.

955
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,600
But I still want to continue to try.

956
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
The days in the future are so long.

957
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Maybe one day it will be better.

958
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
What if?

959
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
You can go to SID.

960
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,600
I will go to SID.

961
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,600
If one day you want those people to pay off,

962
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
you can make this call.

963
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,600
I'll take you to SID directly.

964
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,440
Flowing through the night

965
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,360
The heart is frozen

966
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,080
Even if it's destroyed, there's no way to be reborn

967
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,160
It's just a piece of cake

968
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,160
Touching the future with my hands

969
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,080
The future is still unknown

970
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,720
I'll be there for you

971
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,960
I still can't measure the world

972
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,840
Even if the pain is gone

973
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,680
Like a song, but without words

974
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,680
The truth has crossed my fingers

975
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,440
How many times have I been called by my name

976
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,480
I call out to you from the bottom of the sea

977
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,440
The wind blows away the hidden meaning, and the white light waits for you

978
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,920
I don't care about the existence of tomorrow

979
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,080
I'll try my best to come back to the color in my dreams

980
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:50,360
No matter right or wrong, I'm still a white bird

981
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:56,200
Just go forward

982
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,520
I'll take the pain alone

983
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,080
The wind in the dark, I'll be your one and only

984
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,800
Go forward

985
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,080
Pass through the fog

986
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,720
Don't forget the silence

987
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,720
In the abyss
