1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
Give it back.

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,240
No.

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,840
Su.

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,840
General chapter 3

5
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,960
Come

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,620
Chae

7
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,880
Here

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,020
Waiting for tomorrow

9
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,660
Can you go out and exercise?

10
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,660
Do some health work.

11
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,340
It should be done soon.

12
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,500
Come.

13
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,460
If you don't feel well, call me.

14
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,460
I'll be in the study.

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,620
How are you right now?

16
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,100
Give it to me.

17
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,420
How much more are you going to keep your mouth shut?

18
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,020
Senior.

19
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,960
Quickly.

20
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,680
Yes.

21
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Are you looking for me?

22
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,080
Valley of mosquitoes

23
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Please Turn Right

24
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Aren't those two cars in the car?

25
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,480
I mean, those two Dong above

26
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
are still allномano 좋을ious.

27
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,560
Whether is going to die公ед ...

28
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,900
The case ofacement problems

29
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,140
It is a good idea for me to take up a scope.

30
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,020
No.

31
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,580
Master商 short of its

32
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,640
intelligence

33
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Kaixu...

34
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Kaixu, what's wrong?

35
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Kaixu...

36
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Kaixu!

37
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Kaixu!

38
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
My spiritual map plan...

39
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
can be activated again.

40
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It can be activated again.

41
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Kaixu!

42
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Kaixu!

43
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Kaixu!

44
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Kaixu!

45
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Kaixu!

46
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Calm down.

47
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Calm down.

48
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Kaixu!

49
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Kaixu.

50
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Kaixu.

51
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
What did you do just now?

52
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Kaixu.

53
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,040
The first time I entered the basement,

54
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,880
I couldn't bear to leave that color-coded pearl.

55
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then I heard from there

56
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
the conversation between Pei Zhong and Guanyu.

57
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
I didn't ask you about that.

58
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I entered the room again after half a year.

59
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
This time, it wasn't by chance.

60
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
I entered the room using a password.

61
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Pei Su.

62
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Who were you imitating just now?

63
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
I don't know.

64
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
It's true.

65
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
The words I only remember in my memory,

66
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
I can't bear to look at them.

67
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Pei Su, what were you doing in your nose?

68
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
My mouth was too big for me to take another bite.

69
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Say something.

70
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
What did you do in your nose?

71
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Eat this.

72
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,080
I have this deep suspicion in my heart.

73
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,400
So I'm trying to find a way to kill myself when I was a kid.

74
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
Kill yourself?

75
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,080
How?

76
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
You're hypnotizing yourself.

77
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Is this the new trick you're trying to make?

78
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,840
Pei Su.

79
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,400
Since I first entered the basement,

80
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,880
I just want to tell you that

81
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
people are complicated.

82
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,280
They can't be changed by a set of foundation.

83
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,480
We have willpower,

84
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,560
thoughts,

85
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,480
and emotions.

86
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,560
Just like when you were in the hospital,

87
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,240
you were afraid and shivering because you were worried about being scolded.

88
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
That's because you can feel the pain of others.

89
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,960
You can have a normal emotion.

90
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,080
You've already chosen to be a different person from him.

91
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Senior.

92
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
I was just an accident.

93
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,400
Senior.

94
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,960
Hypnotizing yourself is a basic method of processing memories

95
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
through clinical tests.

96
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,680
It's mainly for patients

97
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,320
who are quite strong in self-defense.

98
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,600
Listen up.

99
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,040
I'll go back and look for other clues.

100
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
Don't bother yourself anymore.

101
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,640
Just do it.

102
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,800
I'll go back and look for other clues.

103
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,200
I'll go back and look for other clues.

104
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
I'll go back and look for other clues.

105
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,480
Listen up.

106
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,360
It's too late, Senior.

107
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,800
If the organization and the relatives

108
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,720
are dealing with the Huo Xiao case,

109
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
we don't have much time left.

110
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,440
The clues from Lin Ming have been broken.

111
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,240
There's no progress from Zeng Feng.

112
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,960
Now, only the memory of Pei Cheng Yu and Liu Gui Wu

113
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,480
is the fastest way for us.

114
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,360
If the relatives

115
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,400
completely clean up the organization,

116
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
sink into the ground, and disappear,

117
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,800
it's too late.

118
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,440
But if with the end of the blockade,

119
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:17,000
the

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,480
I was so confused

121
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,640
It's because of my self-hypnosis

122
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,440
that I slowly remembered the Plain Bay Project

123
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
The more I know

124
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,000
I found out the truth with the Guangyao Foundation

125
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,960
It's just a little bit

126
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
closer to the last one

127
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
But my self-defense mechanism is too strong

128
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,160
Senior

129
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,080
Let me try

130
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay?

131
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
Relax

132
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,040
Relax

133
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Imagine you're on a warm beach

134
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
and it's still very difficult

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,160
The wind is very light

136
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,720
Relax

137
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,200
Relax

138
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I saw it

139
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
What did you see?

140
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I saw

141
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
a group of bikinis

142
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I think I should find you a professional bikini

143
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,320
for the hypnosis test

144
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,080
It's no use to me

145
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,840
So what?

146
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
I'll go and learn the hypnosis certificate

147
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,600
That's not necessary

148
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,280
Senior

149
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,320
Actually, not all hypnosis

150
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,920
needs to be entered through relaxation

151
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,040
How to enter?

152
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,800
You just need to ask questions from the perspective of the observer

153
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,040
and find it with me

154
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,360
Just remember every block of memory

155
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,280
An analysis procedure

156
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Don't go

157
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Don't be afraid.

158
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
What did you hear?

159
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Someone came in.

160
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Pei Chunyu said something.

161
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
What did she say?

162
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
No need.

163
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
No need.

164
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
President Pei.

165
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
You fed them too well.

166
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,160
So they are greedy and ungrateful.

167
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:30,620
They don't listen to the

168
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
Isn't it just a grave?

169
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,620
Can they still make a living?

170
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,620
President Pei, you shouldn't not understand.

171
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,620
Otherwise, we don't have to sit here and talk.

172
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,620
President Pei, have you heard of Ou Ying?

173
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,620
Ou Ying wants to tame her.

174
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
First, we have to weaken her.

175
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,620
Weakening her is a good thing.

176
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
How to feed her?

177
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
How to feed her?

178
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,620
For example,

179
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
To catch the thief.

180
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Or to save the base.

181
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
If the tools are not good,

182
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
We have to be good.

183
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,620
My people have been involved in the organization.

184
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Hatred.

185
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Wounds.

186
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
It's a good resource.

187
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,620
It can make people know how to repay.

188
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
It depends on how you use it.

189
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
The stone has been prepared for you.

190
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,620
It depends on whether you want to give it up.

191
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
President Pei,

192
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,620
Before the contract is signed,

193
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,620
You should invite that thief out.

194
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
Pei Su.

195
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Pei Su.

196
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Pei Su.

197
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Pei Su.

198
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Little boy.

199
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
You can't just hide.

200
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Pei Su.

201
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
Good boy.

202
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Why are you bewitched by our pet?

203
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
It's not his fault that the pet doesn't listen.

204
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
But you, the master, don't understand.

205
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
Pei Su.

206
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Pei Su.

207
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Pei Su.

208
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
This person is very critical.

209
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
He should have participated in the leadership plan.

210
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
Then there is a purpose to enter the organization.

211
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Accepted Pei Cheng Yun.

212
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Use his greed and desire.

213
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Let your own people sink into the organization.

214
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
And under their nose.

215
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
Establish a group of people.

216
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,620
My thoughts.

217
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Whether it's a leader or a commander.

218
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
I don't know.

219
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
I don't know.

220
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
Whether it's a leader or a commander.

221
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,620
It turns out that it's not a matter of self-interest.

222
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:35,560
These years of

223
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
Thank you.

224
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Pei Su.

225
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
Let me ask you.

226
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Pei Cheng Yun.

227
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
What did he do to you?

228
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Why did you pinch your neck with your hand?

229
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
Pei Su.

230
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
You are a professional.

231
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
Tell me.

232
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,620
What is the concept of injury or injury?

233
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
What symptoms will there be?

234
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
I don't have.

235
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
What don't you have?

236
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
I don't have an injury.

237
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,620
Pei Cheng Yun didn't hit me.

238
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,620
I didn't have any human injuries.

239
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
When did the injury specifically affect the physical injury?

240
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
Your last memory.

241
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,620
What did you see?

242
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
Why do you have the behavior of self-harming?

243
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Is it related to your mother?

244
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,620
Did I just say I was tired?

245
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
You started conscience in Dogon.

246
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
I think it's worth upholding my character,

247
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
but I've made up my mind.

248
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,480
I gave up my first spark plot on my own

249
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
because I'm afraid to surrender myself to the circumstances

250
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,620
when Chief reads my shares in There is Fun.

251
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,720
You'll be يا

252
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Pei I can be myself with you in war

253
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
and you can't spare me.

254
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,020
I'm in a bad situation.

255
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,380
Please help Zhou Xuan and Brother Du.

256
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,140
You're welcome.

257
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,860
After all, we all want Huai Xing to die.

258
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,740
There's a clear solution.

259
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,020
If it weren't for your reminder,

260
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,060
I wouldn't have been able to find the truth so soon.

261
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,220
I always feel that the thing that Lin Tang

262
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,700
has been walking around in the safe for a lifetime

263
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,780
isn't just a heart-saving drug that can shock Zhou Jun Hao.

264
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,500
The code on this drug

265
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,420
should be a certain address in the Eastern Courtyard.

266
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,660
Go and check it.

267
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,580
Then go directly to Zhou Huai Xing.

268
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,220
Do you understand?

269
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,220
The code on the drug

270
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,100
is generally an ENA system.

271
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,620
The top three of the code

272
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,420
usually represent a free-trade.

273
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,540
This drug is made in a foreign country.

274
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,820
But the top three of the code on it, the 480,

275
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,020
is from the Eastern Courtyard.

276
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,180
The number of the four digits based on the 480

277
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,620
is the postcard of the Eastern Courtyard.

278
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,860
It's the place where my former accomplice lived.

279
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,300
The Du family has already told you?

280
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
The Du family told me

281
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,340
that he would personally see you once.

282
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,420
Because there are things that he must personally give you.

283
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,260
It's a evidence.

284
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,620
A evidence that can track down Zhou Ya Hou

285
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,300
and the crime scene.

286
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,140
There are things that might be torturing

287
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,940
the creepingDr. Quite Hao Jin.

288
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,460
The meaning of this is death.

289
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,260
My children who were watching the scene

290
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,380
are of high rank.

291
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,340
Someone must have State Security

292
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,780
or some well known kepada fibers

293
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,720
bound into their seasonal corn

294
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,140
sending their children to the harm zone.

295
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,780
All graduated and retired,

296
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,820
ethics, heavy-weight hall,

297
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,380
exclusive squared,

298
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,140
illegitimate and detailed.

299
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,980
And there are consequences in life

300
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,340
And to be expected

301
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,440
Therefore

302
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,180
Nobody can take it

303
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,340
Don't worry

304
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,580
Brother Following Zhou

305
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,500
Zhang reported that

306
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,540
the swim incident at Jiaozhi Huai

307
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,000
is so frequent

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You have to give me the villa

309
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
No problem

310
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's a deal

311
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
OK, tonight

312
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Let's have a good time

313
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Sure

314
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is the truth

315
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The villa

316
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Any secret?

317
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Zhou Ya Hou has a secret private villa

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He likes girls

319
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That villa

320
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Just keep these

321
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
These

322
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Where did the girl come from?

323
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That grandma

324
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And a medical book my mother left me

325
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's about her

326
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Can't bear the truth of Zhou Ya Hou's ghost

327
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Zhou Ya Hou was also very enthusiastic before he died

328
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
He entered this mountain

329
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
In Dongye

330
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He booked a few villas

331
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
What's wrong with this girl?

332
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Can you tell me more about her?

333
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
This is the last girl Zhou Ya Hou adopted

334
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
She came for two months

335
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Zhou Ya Hou died

336
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Then followed Zheng Kaifeng

337
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Zheng Kaifeng

338
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Zhou Ya Hou

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Zhou Ya Hou

340
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Zhou Ya Hou

341
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Zhou Ya Hou

342
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Zhou Ya Hou

343
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Zheng Kaifeng and Su Fei

344
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Correct

345
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But not long after

346
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
My mother found out

347
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
She felt very disgusted

348
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Forced Zheng Kaifeng to send this girl away

349
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Zheng Kaifeng seems to be because of this

350
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I've always hated my mother

351
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I may be Zhou Ya Hou's old rumors

352
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It was also at this time

353
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Spread in the web

354
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What's the connection between Yang Bo and Zheng Kaifeng?

355
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Do you know?

356
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm not sure about this

357
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But I know

358
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Zheng Kaifeng knew Yang Bo

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because his mother

360
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Opened a high-end private restaurant

361
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And Zheng Kaifeng is a regular customer

362
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Private restaurant

363
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Is there anything special?

364
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He's not like Su Fei

365
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Looks very ordinary

366
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I think

367
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
He shouldn't be Zheng Kaifeng's lover

368
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But he is

369
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What's the relationship

370
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't understand

371
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
What's his name?

372
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Zhou Ying Chun

373
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Hello, brother

374
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
In Zhou's case

375
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We have always ignored

376
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
A key problem

377
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You mean

378
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's like Zhou's case

379
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The foundation is in the outside world

380
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
How to get the organization's people?

381
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Su Fei

382
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Su Fei is in the case of Lianhua Mountain

383
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The time to throw the ice and sea bowl

384
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The organization has long proposed the plan of ice and sea bowl

385
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
If all this is not a coincidence

386
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
There is only one possibility

387
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Before the ice and sea bowl was built as a throwing body

388
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
He has already cooperated with those people

389
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If this is the premise

390
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Then Zheng Kaifeng came to Xinzhou

391
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Find Su Fei and become his client

392
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So the people in contact with the organization

393
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Did it go well?

394
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So Su Fei is Zheng Kaifeng

395
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The contact person with the organization

396
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But Su Fei suffered from this before

397
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Died 16 years ago

398
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
After that

399
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Zhou Ying Chun came

400
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's Yang Bo's mother

401
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
If I guess correctly

402
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He should be Su Fei

403
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Contact person between Zheng Kaifeng and the organization

404
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What evidence

405
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Do you remember Yang Feng's suicide

406
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Is a tragic car accident

407
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He obviously served the Guangyao Foundation

408
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But after that

409
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
His wife and children were killed by Zheng Kaifeng

410
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Zhou Ying Chun also sent Yang Bo

411
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
To the trading project sponsored by Zhou's

412
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So Yang Bo is a hostage

413
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Use to threaten such a vicious hostage

414
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But there is a problem

415
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why is it Su Fei and Zhou Ying Chun?

416
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Why don't they believe in a gold owner like Wei Zhanhong and Zheng Kaifeng?

417
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But they are willing to believe in these two women

418
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Maybe when we find out this information

419
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They can't hide it

420
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Zhou Ying Chun

421
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'll send it to Xiao Huanyang

422
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But Su Fei

423
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
His case after the adult

424
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And his birth He'an welfare home

425
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Are not in Xinzhou

426
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'll let the Du family check

427
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
it is good

428
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Is it clear?

429
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Did you find anything?

430
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I have decided

431
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Decided

432
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,800
I've decided.

433
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Decided what?

434
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,560
I want to have braised fish for lunch,

435
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,360
steamed pork with starch and sweet and sour pork ribs.

436
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,040
You keep watching.

437
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,880
I'll go buy it.

438
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,680
Senior.

439
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,000
You and Miss Xiao are still on duty?

440
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
How did you know?

441
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,440
I went to my mom's clinic to treat her.

442
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,240
I saw you.

443
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,440
Is your mom better?

444
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,520
She's still the same.

445
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,680
But I heard that

446
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,800
the suspect who made Tao Zi Ge stay in the hospital

447
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
is already on the verge of waking up.

448
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,880
This is a good news.

449
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,040
I heard that

450
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,800
the suspect who made Tao Zi Ge stay in the hospital

451
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,520
is already on the verge of waking up.

452
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
This is a good news.

453
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,880
Ling Ning is getting worse.

454
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Who told you?

455
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,280
I heard it from someone

456
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
when we were having lunch at the canteen.

457
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,160
Wait.

458
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,680
Is this a secret?

459
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,760
Senior.

460
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,320
Is this the weekend and no doctor?

461
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,200
Give it back.

462
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,800
Let me have a look.

463
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,600
Your

464
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:35,040
person

465
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,600
this

466
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,660
bright

467
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
Stop!

468
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660
Don't come over!

469
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Don't come over!

470
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Calm down.

471
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,660
You can't kill a plant person with one life.

472
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Calm down.

473
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Calm down.

474
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Seriously.

475
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,660
You've seen the situation of Ling Ming.

476
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:14,920
His

477
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
life is

478
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
in danger.

479
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Look at him.

480
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Who do you think he can point to?

481
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Don't you understand?

482
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Who told you that Ling Ming was about to wake up?

483
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
He was obviously lying to you.

484
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Now, someone is lying to you to make a fool of yourself.

485
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
You didn't hurry to get the liar out and drag him into the water.

486
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,920
You even plan to kidnap him and kill him.

487
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Is there something wrong with your brain?

488
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Did Wen Jia fix your brain?

489
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Look at you.

490
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Let me ask you a question.

491
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Are you a wise man?

492
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
A man who has the ability to distinguish a person

493
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
from everyone else,

494
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
can it be a insomniac?

495
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Today, you seem to know everything about the adults.

496
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
You stay away from me.

497
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
you are careful of people and sometimes live the life of a person.

498
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Also, you don't dare to talk about this stuff as a private.

499
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
Don't you want to know what others My

500
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
sword powers,

501
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
as long

502
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,740
am I with another person in definition of a person?

503
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
You gave out information of what others know.

504
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,840
Some ignore it and

505
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
some dare not say anything.

506
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,920
However,

507
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,880
you do want belt in your alias to tell people

508
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,360
waiting and hope

509
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
Patience in waiting

510
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,760
and the motivation to bring hope

511
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,720
will surely bring the dawn of a new life

512
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,200
I'm really a guard

513
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,680
You can go to the hospital

514
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,400
I'm not a professional killer

515
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,040
I need a pen to save my life

516
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,360
I have other ways

517
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
And at first

518
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,640
they only let me keep an eye on Li Ming

519
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,920
This afternoon

520
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,560
I heard from Yin Le

521
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,800
that he was going to wake up

522
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,400
I informed the employer

523
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,040
Who knows

524
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,560
Who knows he can let me

525
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,840
Kill people

526
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,880
500,000

527
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,480
They are really generous

528
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Have you seen them?

529
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,080
I have

530
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,680
Two men

531
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,000
They came to my house on the gold bar

532
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,960
Their boss seems to be not very convenient

533
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,440
but

534
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm not sure

535
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,840
But

536
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,240
There was a car outside

537
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,960
and a big car

538
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,880
It's very suspicious in our poor neighborhood

539
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,960
Go and check the nearby surveillance

540
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,520
Yes

541
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,640
It seems that our judgment is not wrong

542
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,560
Li Ming does not have direct evidence

543
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,840
to point to the organization's leader

544
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,840
So

545
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,440
The one who is so anxious to kill Li Ming

546
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,680
is not the organization's person

547
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,160
but the person in the group

548
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,160
They are afraid that we will be in danger

549
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,480
We are suspicious

550
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,120
We made a evidence chain

551
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,760
to ensure our rescue

552
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,680
We have been using them anyway

553
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,960
Will we ignore the obvious evidence?

554
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,960
They know you are using them too

555
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
This is more of a

556
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,920
sense of ritual to stop someone

557
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,200
The key to victory

558
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,080
is waiting and hope

559
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,480
Now he finally starts to settle down from the first crime

560
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,680
So after the special investigation team found Li Ming

561
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
They sent people

562
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,840
to kill Li Ming in the usual way

563
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,880
Then they found someone to make rumors that Li Ming was going to wake up

564
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,600
and arrange a killer hook

565
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,280
Then when the killer questioned

566
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,920
they called the back of the scene

567
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,520
In the end, even the back of the scene

568
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,280
the video of the old man spending money to buy a chest

569
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,600
was prepared for us

570
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,400
It looks like a coincidence

571
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,600
But when it's all over

572
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,400
the witness and witness

573
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
are not the same

574
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,600
The old man who was the victim

575
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,040
is not the same

576
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
The same as the Huo Xiao case

577
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,520
Someone wants to be the Tangtai Si

578
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,600
to avenge the murderer who killed Huo Xiao

579
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,880
If I'm not wrong

580
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,200
There may be a big suspect in SID today

581
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,920
This person will be the comrade-in-arms of Huo Xiao's childhood

582
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,960
A senior of SID who is highly respected

583
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,360
Maybe he is still powerful

584
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
But once he is in trouble

585
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,800
it will cause a huge scandal in the attack on SID

586
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,560
Captain Luo

587
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,560
This is the photo

588
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,840
Zhang Zuo

589
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,400
Dad

590
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,000
Dad

591
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,600
Dad

592
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,040
Why?

593
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
We don't wear this

594
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,280
You don't discuss with me

595
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,800
I've arranged it

596
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
What are you doing?

597
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,280
Then

598
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,200
Brother

599
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,000
Dad

600
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,040
Didn't we agree

601
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,200
to go to grandma's house with Ying Ying

602
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
Why did you go to Dongyue again?

603
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,840
How many times have you been there?

604
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,760
Why suddenly

605
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

606
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,400
Didn't you see me playing chess with uncle?

607
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,360
Put it out

608
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,320
Put it out

609
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,080
I'm leaving, uncle

610
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,640
Stop

611
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,640
Did I get into trouble?

612
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,400
You are

613
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,000
We're police

614
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,200
There are many people in suits.

615
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,760
Zhang Zu,

616
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,640
I need you to cooperate with the investigation.

617
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,400
Please come with us.

618
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,520
Salute Bo Shuai.

619
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,600
That's the way.

620
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,800
Zhang Zu.

621
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,860
I'll bring her back to her room.

622
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,160
Let her go back to her room.

623
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,740
Yeah.

624
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,020
Huh?

625
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:33,780
You are...

626
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:59,040
What's not fair

627
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm sorry.

628
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
If you have anything to say,

629
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
just say it.

630
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
I'll do my best

631
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
to cooperate with you.

632
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
I didn't expect your private driver

633
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
to be so good.

634
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
This car belongs to my brother.

635
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
I've been working at the research department recently.

636
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
He's afraid that I'm not convenient to go out,

637
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,040
so he gave me the company's car.

638
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
I'm not considerate.

639
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
It's convenient to go out.

640
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Maybe it's a bad influence.

641
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Brother?

642
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
You're so close.

643
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
He's two years younger than me.

644
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
We grew up together.

645
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
We have a good relationship.

646
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Yes.

647
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Later, he did business well.

648
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
He collected some profits.

649
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
To be honest,

650
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
I don't like him.

651
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,040
But I can promise you

652
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
that his business

653
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,040
has nothing to do with my job.

654
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
I never used my position

655
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
to help him.

656
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Brother,

657
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
if the inspection bureau thinks

658
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
that my private life is too luxurious

659
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
and damages the image of SID,

660
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,040
I'm willing to take the punishment.

661
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
But,

662
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I have no qualms

663
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
except this.

664
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
Why did you appear

665
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
in the Lv Yuting community

666
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,040
at two o'clock on the afternoon of the 11th?

667
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
What did you do there?

668
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
Lv Yuting?

669
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
I have no idea.

670
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
Then why did you appear

671
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
in the surveillance?

672
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
I was there.

673
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,040
I was there.

674
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
I was there.

675
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
It should be near Liu'an Bridge.

676
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
Yes.

677
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
I went to the hospital that day

678
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,040
to see Yang's family.

679
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
I found that I didn't bring anything on the way.

680
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
So I asked the driver to give me a high price near Liu'an Bridge.

681
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
Because there is a relatively large shopping center.

682
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
I did see some residential areas on the way.

683
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
But I didn't notice what they were called.

684
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
I threw away the small tickets.

685
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
But near Shuyingtai mall,

686
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
there should be surveillance.

687
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
After buying things,

688
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
Yang's wife and daughter can prove it.

689
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
Do you know this person?

690
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,040
Take a closer look.

691
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
This person pretended to be a guard and sneaked into the hospital this noon

692
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,040
to kill the last key witness of the fraud case.

693
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,040
But he was caught on the spot by SID.

694
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
Now, this murderer is only you.

695
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Why did he do that?

696
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
I killed someone without a reason.

697
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,040
But I killed a key witness who could help with the fraud case.

698
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Is that what you mean?

699
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,040
What do I want?

700
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
You suspect that

701
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
it was me that year.

702
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
It was me.

703
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
We found 500,000 gold bars at this killer's residence.

704
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
It was the key witness.

705
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
How much?

706
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
500,000.

707
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
What do you think?

708
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,040
The evidence found under the goods sales bed

709
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
is 500,000 gold bars.

710
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
I'll go out for a walk.

711
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,040
I'll go out for a walk.

712
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
Director Du.

713
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
Why don't you go in?

714
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
The investigation team has restored the complete phone recording.

715
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,040
The current evidence can fully prove

716
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Director Du's innocence

717
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,040
and Kong Wei City's identity as the killer.

718
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
Director Du.

719
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,040
Why are you here?

720
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
The source of this case

721
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
was caused by the goods sales case.

722
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
I've been working with Old Zhang for so long.

723
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
There are some things that Supervisor Luo

724
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,040
wants me to talk to Old Zhang.

725
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,040
I heard from Old Zhang.

726
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,040
You've been doing very well these days.

727
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,040
Supervisor Luo.

728
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,040
I'm sorry.

729
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm sorry.

730
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,040
I'm sorry.

731
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,040
I'm sorry.

732
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,040
I'm sorry.

733
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,040
I'm sorry.

734
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,040
I'm sorry.

735
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,040
I'm sorry.

736
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,040
I'm sorry.

737
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,040
I'm sorry.

738
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,040
I'm sorry.

739
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,040
I'm sorry.

740
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,040
I'm sorry.

741
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,040
I'm sorry.

742
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm sorry.

743
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
I'm sorry.

744
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
I'm sorry.

745
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,040
I'm sorry.

746
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,040
I'm sorry.

747
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,040
I'm sorry.

748
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,040
I'm sorry.

749
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,040
I'm sorry.

750
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
I'm sorry.

751
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
I'm sorry.

752
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
I'm sorry.

753
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,040
I'm sorry.

755
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,040
I'm sorry.

756
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,040
I'm sorry.

757
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,040
I'm sorry.

758
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
I'm sorry.

759
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
I'm sorry.
